The answer is that player two wins with probability \(\frac{5}{9}\).

Why?

I originally just brute forced solved the integral, but it's easier to see after a change of variables.
The log of a uniform \(0, 1\) random variable is exponentially distributed with parameter \(1\).
So this boils down to the claim that if \(X, Y, Z \sim \textrm{Exp}(1)\) then \(P(X + Y \leq 2Z) = \frac{5}{9}\).

The proof of this is as follows:

\begin{align}
P(X + Y \leq 2Z) &= P(Z \geq \frac{X + Y}{2}) \\
& = \int\limits_{x, y \geq 0} e^{-x - y} \int\limits_{z \geq \frac{x + y}{2}} e^{-z} dx dx dy \\
& = \int\limits_{x, y \geq 0} e^{-x - y} (1 - e^{-\frac{x + y}{2}}) dx dy \\
& = \int\limits_{x, y \geq 0} e^{-x} e^{- y} dx dy  - \int\limits_{x, y \geq 0} e^{-\frac{3}{2} x}  e^{-\frac{3}{2} y} dx dy  \\
& = \left(\int\limits_{x, y \geq 0} e^{-x} dx\right)^2  -  \left(\int\limits_{x, y \geq 0} e^{-\frac{3}{2}x} dx\right)^2 \\
& = 1^2 - \lef(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 \\
& = \frac{5}{9} \\
\end{align}

I still feel like there should be a nicer solution than this. It's a step above just brute force solving the integral in tidiness, but I don't feel it makes it any more intuitive where the actual number comes from.
