# Streak maintenance is complicated

I'm a big fan of daily writing. I think it does things that almost any other writing frequency doesn't manage, and I like to keep it up when I can. I've done it pretty well this year, with a few days missed and made up for the previous day, but by and large I've managed the daily habit if we allow for that cheat rule. Some of the posts have been phoned in, a lot of them have been cobbled together from whatever spare material I've had around, but a lot of them have been novel and some of them have been good, and there's even some overlap between those two categories. Even the ones that aren't either have felt at least lightly worth doing.

Then, as you might have noticed, I didn't write anything for five days. There've been reasons. They don't matter right now. What I want to talk about is the experience of resuming after a break like that.

The first thing is that I have no intention of making up those missing days. In fact, I'm actively declaring that I will *not* make up those missing days. It would be a bad idea. The streak is broken, in a way that a day of catch up does not count as breaking, and that's fine.

The problem with daily writing is that it turns writing into a streak maintenance problem. The measure of your success is how long you've managed to keep the streak going, and you are motivated to make number go up.

Unfortunately, what this means is that the longer the streak's been going for, the worst losing it feels.
