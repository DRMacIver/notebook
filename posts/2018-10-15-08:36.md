# Book Review: We Should All Be Feminists by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie

Short, persuasively written, and a lovely interweaving of the personal and the political.

Unless you haven't been paying attention (which is a lot of people), probably doesn't contain anything very new to you except some of the details of how gendered issues play out specifically in Nigeria, but still a good read.
