# Everything is a teachable moment

Previously I have written blog posts about:

* [A cat who can open doors](https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/thinking-through-the-implications/)
* [Fixing a shower](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-26-09:48.html)
* [How to get started in a new code base](https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/08/how-did-you-get-started-so-quickly/)

Except that's not what any of these are about.

They're actually about:

* *Toolkitized thinking* - how to apply things that you've learned in other contexts
* *Pragmatic problem solving* - how to let go of the desire to solve the problem properly and just solve the problem
* *Efficient learning* - how not to get distracted by [the impossibly large number of things to learn](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-22-18:01.html).

Each of them are of course about both these things: Something happened, and by looking at what happened you can learn something generalisable about it.

Typically of course, you don't actually see a single thing and get the general insight, you acquire the general insight after seeing many different things, but often a specific example is exactly what you need to [explain the point](https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/), possibly to someone else, possibly to yourself.

The important feature of these generalisations is that by doing this you learn beyond the specific circumstances you encounter and [experience the world richly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758026/), letting you draw on your past experience more effectively in novel situations.

One way of looking at mathematics is that it's about taking a look at an argument and paring it down to its bare essentials and generalising it. Trying to take something hyper specific and turn it into a simple reusable principle that can be applied, by asking what about the problem actually matters.

Our interactions with the world are like this too. Everything is a teachable moment, all you have to do is look at it through the right lens and use it to teach something.
