# Lightweight RPG Systems

[This was a good thread about Fail Better Games's new RPG](https://twitter.com/CHGardiner/status/1043568602283171842),
which in particular links to a lot of other interesting lightweight systems.

Mostly putting this here to save for later because I struggled tor refind it.

Another thing which isn't in this thread but was mentioned to me recently and looks a lot of fun is [Lasers and Feelings](http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf)
