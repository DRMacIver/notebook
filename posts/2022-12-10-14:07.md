# Some reasons to reject Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility

I regularly have frustrating arguments with people who think that Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theory is a pretty neat idea.

From my perspective these arguments go as follows:

1. Someone strongly declares that an insane theory with only the most tenuous connection to reality is the only possible approach.
2. I point out one of the myriad flaws with this theory.
3. They accuse me of nitpicking.

So be warned that if you think VNM theory is true, you're unlikely to be convinced by this article and are probably just going to accuse me of nitpicking.

The core of my objection to VNM theory is that:

1. It handwaves aside all the preconditions required to apply the theory.
2. It handwaves aside the requirements that an agent must satisfy in order to be able to have a VNM utility function.
3. It equates things that should not be equated in a way that is crucial to its normative force.
4. It is completely irrelevant to agents who learn about their preferences from experience, which is all real agents.
5. It is completely irrelevant to making decisions that change the world in a way that alters their preferences.

## Preconditions to apply the theory

Note that VNM theory is a theory for deciding between lotteries over a finite set of choices with known probabilities.

This means that is a theory that is completely unable to take into account a poorly understood unbounded world, which is the one in which we are
