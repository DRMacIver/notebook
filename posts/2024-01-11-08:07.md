# Thinking in memes

Another draft bankruptcy post, though I'm going to continue this on
for a bit as it's really more of the prompt for a post than a full
abandoned draft.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Some of you get annoyed when I write very culturally bound things that
rely on a lot of shared context. Like Shaka, when the walls fell, you
will not enjoy this post. You may or may not wish to bear with me
anyway.

Anyway, this is a post about memes. Mostly of the internet sort, not the
Dawkins sort, although a little bit also of the Dawkins sort.

This passage is one of various things the world has chucked over the
wall into my mind. I like to imagine that the garden has been raked
around the rubbish in the same way as it would any large rock or
intrusion into it.

This is often how my mind feels to me. Things appear in it from the
world and stay there, patterns radiating outwards, interfering and
interacting and creating something unique and sometimes beautiful
patterns, but it often starts from garbage.

## Trekkies, watching Darmok

The "Star Trek: The Next Generation" episode "Darmok" is about a race of
aliens whose communication style does not correctly translate, because
everything they say is in terms of analogy to previous events.

Editor's note: I think I stopped writing this post because this section was
boring. Please insert any one of various standard takes about how the way
we communicate on the internet is like this.

## The associative value of memes

Because what I actually wanted to talk about was the use of memes for
thinking rather than about how we talk with them.

Some of this is just the usual straightforward way that any language
is a tool for thought: Having a concept for a thing allows you to think
about the thing.

But memes have an unusual sticking power, because of the richness of the
concept. They usually have an image with a quite specific vibe associated
with them. Sometimes they undergo enough evolution that they leave the
image behind, but even there there's a whole web of associations that
helps make them feel really accessible and live.

 I've talked about a related phenomenon in [Reading philosophy for the
examples](https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/reading-philosophy-for-the-examples),
where having a whole rich example for a concept makes it much more relevant.

*Purple suited man riding a rocket duck, as you do.*

Even in that post the images help. I've still got a concept for duck guy
that feels quite live,^[I still don't really know how to talk to him, though I suspect I'm better at it than most.]
and Danny at the Grand Canyon also sticks around, but I had to look up the rest.

The particularly useful function of memes as a tool of thought though
is the way they spring unbidden to mind.

For example, a useful meme to acquire recently has been "Stop. Look. Think. Are you eating yourself?"

![](/images/ouroboros.png)
*[Buy the T-shirt here](https://topatoco.com/products/og-ouroboros)*

When stuck in unhelpful patterns, it's helpful to remember this goofy little guy and ask if I'm currently eating myself.

Another good related tool comes from catchy songs. Discord got a bit obsessed with the song Diggy Diggy Hole for a while:^[I can't imagine how this could possibly have happened and definitely accept no culpability in it...]

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ytWz0qVvBZ0?si=8JxlPuz0o1eb6dZw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It became a bit of an injoke for a while to come up with many variations of this to the tune of verby verby noun^[I am on discord and I'm verbing a noun. verby verby noun. verby verby noun.], but the one that's really usefully stuck is that when you're caught in that annoying state of endlessly browsing the internet, doomscrolling, etc. you're in a clicky clicky loop.^[Clicky clicky loop. Clicky clicky loop...]
Having this concept available is often enough to break you out of it when the music starts playing in your head.

And of course, there's the eagle that makes me go outside whenever I think about it:^[This hasn't actually worked very well recently, but in my defence it's been cold and dark and wet and I don't like. Admittedly this is also the eagle's vibe so this isn't much of a defence.]

![](/images/stupid-little-walk.png)
*An eagle going on a stupid little daily walk for it stupid physical and mental health.*

I partly think of these posts as my stupid little daily writing for my stupid mental health.

## No private language

I think an important feature of memes is that they're social. Very few of these things would have stuck without
a community of people reinforcing them.

Partly this is because talking about the meme makes it more salient, part of this is because I think a group is
much better at building memes that are optimised to work.

I think there are probably useful magical practices (sigil creation etc) that do pull off this sort of trick
privately, but personally I've never got them to work. I think it's important to me that eagle and ouroboros
are shared concepts for the things they represent.

Maybe this is something communities should do a bit more intentionally though. Crafting and selecting memes
for their common problems. I'm not really sure what this would look like, but it's worth thinking about.
