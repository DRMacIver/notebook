# Onion, Bacon, and Potato Pancakes

One of the things I miss about not being able to eat wheat and dairy is pancakes.
I'm currently experimenting with fixing this.

The main thing I've learned is that potato starch works *really* well as a flour substitute for this, to the point where I almost prefer it to real flour.
Unfortunately I haven't yet figured out how to make pancakes without dairy that taste normal and aren't a bit boring. The baseline is fine but a bit bland.

This was an attempt to pull the pancakes slightly in the direction of more conventional potato pancakes flavour wise. I would describe it as "worked pretty well but needs work".


* 1 cup potato starch
* 6 rashers unsoked bacon
* 1 medium onion
* 3 medium duck eggs
* \(\frac{1}{2}\) tsp bicarbonate of soda
* \(\frac{1}{2}\) tsp cream of tartar
* lots of sunflower oil
* lots of black pepper

Preparation steps:

* Dice the onion and chop up the bacon. Fry it in oil until browned.
* Put everything in a food processor and blend until smooth
* Add more oil to the pan, spoon pancake mix into it, and fry. Flip over a couple of times.

Unlike my normal pancake recipe, using potato flour seems to demand a fairly well oiled pan and a much higher heat.

Things I would change next time:

* I think the addition of the bacon was a mistake. It might work well *with* bacon, but it's a bit weird in the pancakes.
* More rising agent
* Less black pepper
