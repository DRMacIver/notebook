# Book list from CUP.

I have a habit for stopping myself from buying too many books in book stores:
When I see a book that I want but am unsure about, I go "Oh that looks interesting" and take a photo of the book instead of buying it.
I try to make sure when doing this I always buy at least one or two books so I don't feel like I'm ripping the store off,
but it curbs the worst of the spending spree impulse.

Anyway I was in Cambridge University Press book store yesterday. The following are the books I noted as looking interesting but probably available via my university library:

* Geometry and topological inference - Boissonnat et al.
* High-Dimensional Probability - Vershynin
* A student's guide to Lagrangians and Hamiltonians - Hamill
* Reporting Results - A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists - Van Aken and Hosford
* Statistical Inference as Severe Testing - Mayo
* Creative Mathematics - Beardon
* Subjective Probability - Jeffrey
* Butcher's Copy-Editing - Butcher et al.
* The Reader's Brain - Douglas
* Handbook for Academic Authors - Luey
* Writing Sucessful Academic Books - Haynes

The books I actually bought were:

* Learn to write badly - Billig
* Resilience - Southwick and Charney

I'm currently about halfway through "Learn to write badly". It's both very interesting and not at all what it sounds like.
