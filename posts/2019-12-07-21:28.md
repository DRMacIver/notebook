# Almost every set is immune

A set \(A \subseteq N\) is recursively enumerable if it can be enumerated by a computable function (formally, if there is some turing machine that halts on an input if and only if it's in the set).
If an infinite set contains no infinite recursively enumerable subsets, it is called immune.
I was introduced to this concept by [Gary Fredericks](https://twitter.com/gfredericks_/status/1203345019115053056):

In fact they are not weird, they are normal. Almost every infinite subset of \(\mathbb{N}\) is immune.

To see this, consider the set \(C = \{0, 1\}^\mathbb{N}\). This can be mapped to the power set of the natural numbers by mapping a set to its indicator function \(1_A\), where \(1_A(x) = 1\) if \(x \in A\) and \(0\) otherwise.
Every \(x \in C\) is the indicator function of \(A = \{n: x_n = 1\}\) so this mapping is a bijection.

\(C\) is [a probability space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space), with the probability corresponding to the probability of observing an event with an infinite sequence of uniform coin tosses.

In this note I'll show that a randomly chosen \(x \in C\) corresponds to an immune set with probability one.

To see this, let \(A \subsetq N\) be any infinite set. The probability that a random element of \(C\) contains \(A\) as a subset of its corresponding set must be zero, because this happens if and only if \(x_n = 1\) for all \(n \in A\).
The probability of any \(n\) given coordinates being \(1\) is \(2^{-n}\), so the probability of infinitely many specified coordinates being \(1\) must be \(\leq 2^{n}\) for all \(n\), i.e. \(0\).

There are only countably many infinite recursively enumerable sets (because each is defined by a turing machine and there are only countably many turing machines).
Enumerate them as \(R_i\).
\(P(x \text{ is not immune}) = P(\bigcup\limits_n \{1_C : R_n \subseteq C\}) \leq \sum\limits_n P(\{1_C: R_n \subseteq C\}) = \sum\limits_n 0 = 0\).
So the probability of a randomly picked subset of \(\mathbb{N}\) *not* being immune is zero,
and thus the probability of a randomly picked subset of \(\mathbb{N}\) is \(1\).
