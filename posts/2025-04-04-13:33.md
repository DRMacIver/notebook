# Why do you do things?

I recently watched CJTheX's [6 Shapes of God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZg_36utl2w). I don't really know if I recommend it or not. I recommend giving it a go and either you'll find it weirdly compelling and watch it or you won't want to watch it and both are fine outcomes.

One of the things they talk about in it, partially rooted in some work by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt that I'm passingly familiar with^[And really should read more of. I find Frankfurt a bit dry, but generally he makes really interesting points about stuff I care about.] is that there's a sort of division into "instrumental ends" (e.g. I want to make money) and "terminal ends" (I want to have fun)  that is natural to make, and also is sortof fake, because we also take on our "terminal ends" for instrumental reasons: If we didn't have something to strive for, we'd be bored.^[I think I might here be conflating Harry Frankfurt's views with Elijah Millgram's "On being bored out of your mind", but in my defence that paper is specifically building on Frankfurt's work here.]

Frankfurt^[I think.] introduces the idea of "maeutic" ends - ends which lead to you taking on other ends in order to achieve them. e.g. you might want to be happy, but merely aiming directly at happiness doesn't work. In order to achieve happiness, the most effective means is to find something that can matter to you for its own sake, and then *sincerely take that on as an end*, and happiness will emerge. e.g. when deciding what to do with your life, you might decide to be a doctor because that seems fulfilling to you, but you can't be a doctor to seek fulfillment and expect to be fulfilled, you need to decide that being a doctor genuinely matters. You might later decide that it is not if it's making you miserable and lacks the qualities that matter to you, but in the moment your day-to-day reason has to be about the end of *being a doctor*, not *being a doctor in order to be fulfilled*.

The instrumental/terminal distinction is still useful though, it's just important to understand that "why?" answers are weird and defeasible and necessarily incomplete.

Why did you eat that cake? Because it was delicious.

If you look at this as a sort of pure logical syllogism sort of answer
