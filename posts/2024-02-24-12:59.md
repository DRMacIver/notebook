# The trouble with habits

I'd like to resume writing here. 

The problem is that I'd like to do daily writing, but don't think I can keep up with daily writing right now.

This combination of facts means that, emotionally, it's hard to write at all, because it seems like my choices are between not doing the thing, and failing at doing the thing, and the former is emotionally much easier.

This is, of course, ridiculous. Writing is better than not writing, therefore doing some writing but not daily writing should not feel worse than doing no writing.

At the same time I do think there's something to it.
