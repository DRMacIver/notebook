# Programming vs Mathematics

Programming: "Custom operators and single letter variable names? Why so terse? Bytes are cheap! Suspish. Not sure if want. Code should be optimised for reading, not writing!"

Mathematics: "Let \(\alpha, \gamma, \beta\) be as in theorem 17.1. If \(\gamma \wedge \beta\) is a normal R-domain, then \(\mu(\alpha \oplus \gamma) \dagger \beta\) is quasi-uniform.

(No, that's not an actual quote and those terms don't really mean anything)
