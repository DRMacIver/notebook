# Vegetables and diet

This post by Sarah Constantin about the [Fasting Mimicking Diet](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2018/10/04/fasting-mimicking-diet-looks-pretty-good/) looks interesting (I generally trust her health recommendations, insofar as I trust anyone's).

In particular the concrete diet plan suggested is:

> For the first five weekdays of every month, eat nothing but (non-potato) vegetables, cooked in fat if desired.  The rest of the time, eat whatever you want.

I've [previously written about trying to eat more vegetables](https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/07/notes-on-eating-more-vegetables/), where I'm trying to bring my meals up to at least half vegetables by volume. I've been doing pretty well on this for most non-breakfast meals, with the exception of lunches when I go in to imperial.

I'm quite tempted to try this diet, in large part because it will I think force me to sort out my bringing lunch to work situation.
