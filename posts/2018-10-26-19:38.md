# Book Review: Thinking in Systems by Donella H. Meadows

Decent introduction to systems thinking. Not super useful for me given that it was a bit preaching to the choir, but helped fill in some gaps and I'd recommend it as an intro for people who *don't* naturally think this way.

I found some of the examples a bit dated and the politics a little annoying in a few places. I also feel like it was less actionable than the author believes it to be. All told though it's a nice, clear, and enjoyable read.
