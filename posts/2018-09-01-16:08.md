# Modes of writing

Two posts on writing to contrast:

* [On the creative merits of paper](https://blog.malignat.us/2018-05-12/on-the-creative-merits-of-paper)
* [Comparison of text editing methods](http://devonzuegel.com/post/comparison-of-text-editing-methods)

Devon posted the second on twitter and it reminded me of the first, which I struggled to refind, which is part of why I'm posting it here.

I've been finding having a paper journal very useful, but I'm also finding having this new notebook useful in an entirely different way.
The contrast is very interesting.
