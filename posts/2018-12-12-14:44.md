# Another attempt at brownies.

Continuing to [iterate on how to do brownies without wheat or dairy](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-12-09-19:55.html).

Today's attempted ratios:

 *  1 cup ground almonds
 *  2 cups granulated white sugar
 *  1 cups dark cocoa powder
 *  0.5 cups vegetable oil
 *  5 eggs

The results are OK but they're too sweet (I know this seems unsurprising given the amount of sugar, but this recipe *works* if you use flour and butter) and lack structural integrity.
I think the excessive sweetness is probably because I forgot the salt.
Either way the last batch was definitely superior.
