I don't actually ascribe to this worldview (I believe very strongly that dehumanizing your opponents is morally indefensible no matter how evil you think they are),
and there are literally dozens of MPs who I would be sad if they were hanged,
but sometimes my inner evil overlord just insists on coming out to play.

Also I really want to use this line in a story now.
