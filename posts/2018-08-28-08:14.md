# First!

This is an experimental new "blog" of sorts intended for brief notes, thoughts, experimenting with notation, and generally trying to find a low friction way to express myself in a manner that I like.

It's loosely inspired by [Mark Jason Dominus's shitposting blog](https://shitpost.plover.com/) and by my frustrations with WordPress, but I'm not really sure where it's going yet.
