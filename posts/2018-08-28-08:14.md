# First!

This is an experimental new blog intended for notes, thoughts, and whatever else I want to put here.
It will likely be biased towards short notes rather than longform essays.
It's loosely inspired by [Mark Jason Dominus's shitposting blog](https://shitpost.plover.com/) and by my frustrations with WordPress, but I'm not really sure where it's going yet. 


It's also a place where I'll be experimenting with notation,
and generally trying to find a low friction way to express myself in a manner that I like.
As such it's all a bit cobbled together out of spit, bailing wire, and Python.

## Notational Highlights

I kinda hate LaTeX, but it's the best typesetting language for mathematics that I know of,
so this notebook supports mathjax. This is a test post to see how that works.

\(e^{i\pi} = -1\)


A test of code highlighting.

```python
class SomeClass(object):
    """"A python class"""

    def method(self):
        """A method definition"""
```

As you've probably noticed, I'm using [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/).
I'm not sure it's exactly what I want, but it's a lot closer to what I want htan most other things I've tried.
I will likely be messing aroudn with this further.

I'm also using [mako templates](http://www.makotemplates.org),
and fully intend to define a metric tonne of macros to make this usable.

In general I expect the actual source code for this site to be totally unusable to anyone who is not me.
If anything,
if it's *not* then I probably haven't done enough customization for my brain.
