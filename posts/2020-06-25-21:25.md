# Trying out this thing called Hypothesis

Hey, you know that software called Hypothesis?

No, not [that one](https://hypothesis.works/), the one for [web annotation](https://hypothes.is/).

Anyway, [nibras was expression an urge to comment inline on her friends' websites](https://twitter.com/nibrasibn/status/1275811352225906688) and I pointed out that this was exactly what hypothesis is for.

Then it occurred to me that it *would* be nice to expose that sort of functionality directly on the notebook. It turns out you can embed hypothes.is directly into your site with an easy piece of javascript, so now I have. You should be able to add annotations to any of the notebook posts (it's not currently turned on for posts as they show up in the index, because I couldn't be bothered to figure out how).

You'll need an account on [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/) to make annotations, but you should be able to see any public annotations people make. The toolbar on the right will give you some options to control what you see.

To make an annotation just select some text, click "annotate" and write whatever you like there. It should hopefully all be fairly intuitive.
