Compare and contrast:

* ["Aristotle" on trolling](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/aristotle-on-trolling/540BB557C82186C33BFFB61E35A0B5B6)
* [Etiquette for the Devil's advocates](https://www.drmaciver.com/2014/02/etiquette-for-the-devils-advocates/)

I think the role the "Aristotle" (AKA [Rachel Barney](http://individual.utoronto.ca/rbarney/Home.html)) describes is probably quite a useful one in the right context,
the problem is that the nature of Trolling as defined in that paper is intrinsically that it is done *not* in the right context.

There's a thing that happens in Vernor Vinge's "A Deepness in the Sky" where the Evil Overlord &trade; is experimenting with different configurations you can put a group mind in.
I sometimes think about this as an analogy for how to construct better modes of group problem solving (in a non-evil-overlord way that in no way involves my using the army of crows that I don't have to impose my will on the unsuspecting masses. Yes) .

In particular, I think it's often actively useful for someone to explicitly take an adversarial role in a group discussion,
and it improves the resulting group's intelligence.
The difficulty is that you need to do this in a context where the group consents to this, and with a fairly explicit discussion in advance of boundaries.
It also helps to be able to ask the adversary to step out of the adversarial role and clarify their position.
