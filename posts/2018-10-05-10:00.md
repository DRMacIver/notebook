# Maybe these two great flavours go together

A problem I have is that when trying to fix stuff I want to do too many things at once, and then I don't know which of them worked.

A thing that I just occurred to me is that I know rather a lot about test-case reduction.

Maybe these things could go together...

(You still have the problem that the things you try may interfere with each other but I think that's a lesser issue)

Really the proper frame for this is probably [group testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_testing) rather than test case reduction, but use what you know.
