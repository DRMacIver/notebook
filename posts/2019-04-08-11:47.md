# Book Review: "Daring Greatly" by Brene Brown

This was a pretty good book, and is going onto my rereadings shelf.

A friend described Brene Brown as "A bit too shiny and US American self-helpy" and that's not an unfair description,
but I found the book fairly useful anyway.

The most useful aspect of this book for me was clarifying the distinction of *shame* vs *guilt*. Guilt is feeling that you have done something bad, shame is feeling that you are something bad. The former is often a productive emotion (within bounds), the latter almost never is, because thinking you are in some way *intrinsically* bad mostly causes you to lock down and blocks you from becoming better.

I also found the discussion of how shame plays out differently depending on gender helpful for reasons that I don't currently feel able to elaborate well.

There are a number of suggested interventions in this book. I've yet to try any of them and I'm not convinced that I'm going to, but I intend to revisit it and that may change when I do.
Even without those interventions, I found it helpful for reshaping some of my perspectives and giving me better language to talk about it.
