# Talking to your imaginary friends as a writing prompt

This is an idea that has been bumping around in my head for a while and I've never quite got around to trying,
but I still think it's a good idea.

A common problem is this: I want to write, but I don't know what to write about.

A possible solution to this is as follows: Make up a fictional character, and have a conversation with them about something.

Even if you don't do anything with this, it's still useful writing practice, but I suspect it will also result in things that might be usefully edited into a long form piece.

Possible prompts within that:

1. Explain some problem you're having to the fictional person.
2. The fictional person doesn't understand something and wants your advice on it.
