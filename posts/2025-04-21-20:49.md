# Resuming habits

I took a deliberate break from the daily posting habit over the easter weekend. I think this was the right choice.

But now, I'm faced with a perennial difficult problem: Once you've paused a habit, you've lost inertia, and now you have to deal with the difficult task of starting again from a cold start.

What I've often found in the past is that this causes you to delay, and then the habit develops an ugh field, and this makes it harder and harder to start, and suddenly months have passed without you having touched it.

I think the solution to this is that whenever resuming a habit, even after an incredibly short break but certainly after a long one, you should deliberately do so in the lowest effort way possible.

Like this.
