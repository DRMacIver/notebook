# Notes on Reduced Output

You've probably noticed that, despite [my advocacy for daily writing](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html) I've stopped writing here daily.

I think there are a couple of things going on.

The first is, as noted in [habit overload](https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-16-09:22.html) I've got just a bit too much going on habit-wise at the moment, and the daily notebook post has been crowded out a bit.

The second is, a lot of the utility of the notebook has been supplanted for me by other things.
This notebook is a place where I process thoughts and explain things I want to explain, but the former has been taken over by morning pages, and the latter has been taken over by the newsletter.

As a result, the notebook is left a bit vestigial. It's not clear what it's purpose is, and it's not quite clear where it fits into everything else in my habit schedule.

This is a shame, because I like the notebook and I'd quite like to stick with it,
so I think for the next week I'm going to double down on it as follows:

1. I'm going to write the notebook post immediately after lunch.
2. I'm going to use a book prompt every day regardless of whether I feel like writing something else.

This should hopefully help it find a better place in my schedule and use cases.
