# Communicating Knowledge

[Copied over from Twitter](https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1048166537172013056) so I don't lose this.

> My brain is currently trying to synthesise some stuff together that I'm not sure I can articulate in less than a Chidi-thesis worth of content and it's very annoying.
> 
> The following combine in a way that I have not yet been able to tease out a small t thesis from:
> 
> * "The Shock of the Old" - David Edgerton
> * "Shop Class as Soulcraft" - Matthew Crawford
> * "The Two Cultures of Mathematics" - Tim Gowers
> * "Telling is Listening" - Ursula Le Guin
> 
> Roughly the area I am attempting to sound out is the idea of knowledge which is embodied in a person or a group, and cannot be separated from that without essentially rebuilding it from scratch (possibly with some gentle editing from a teacher who already understands it).
> 
> Physical skills are very much like this (you can't just read a book to learn a martial art), but I think we treat cognitive skills as if they're *not* like this, when they absolutely are, and we privilege knowledge based on how close it is to the ideal of transmissibility.
