# Pork Meatballs with Ground Almonds

I'm currently starting a restriction diet to cut out a bunch of things, which is about as hateful as it sounds.
It also means that I'm temporarily giving up on my usual restrictions on eating almost no fish and not much meat,
because it's too many restrictions to juggle at once.
This combination means that my cooking is going to go a bit... weird over the near term future.

Anyway, here are the meatballs I made last night. They were pretty good:

* 500g minced pork
* Two medium eggs
* 2/3 cup ground almonds
* 1tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp chilli (I realised afterwards that chilli is also something I'm supposed to be restricting, sigh)

Instructions: Mix all the ingredients together, smoosh them into meatballs, shallow fry in vegetable oil, turning over as they cook. They're ready when they uh look ready. I didn't exactly do science to that bit.
