<h1 id="there-are-a-lot-of-irreducible-finite-partial-orders">There are
a lot of irreducible finite partial orders</h1>
<p>Advance warning: You don’t care about this post. Tersely written
notes about a question you’ve probably never wondered about.</p>
<p>A problem I’ve been thinking about on and off for a month or two is
as follows:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be partial orders. You can combine them
with the following operations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(A \sqcup B\)</span> is the partial order
on the disjoint union of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> such that no element of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is comparable to an element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (and elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> compare as usual).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A // B\)</span> is the partial order on
the disjoint union of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a
\preceq b\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span> (and elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> compare as usual).</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span> is the partial order
on the product of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((r, s) \preceq (u, v)\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(r \preceq u\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s \preceq v\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Say a partial order is irreducible if it cannot be expressed as a
combination of two non-trivial smaller partial orders with one of these
operations (note: non-trivial means “non-empty” for the first two and
“more than one element” for the third).</p>
<p>You can think of the irreducible finite partial orders as a sort of
building block for the finite partial orders, and something I’ve been
wondering is if irreducible finite partial orders have a nice
characterisation and how many there are. I now think the answers are:
Probably not, and lots.</p>
<p>Here are some vaguely negative results in this space.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There are irreducible partial orders of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for every <span class="math inline">\(n
&gt; 3\)</span>. There are no irreducible partial orders of size <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</li>
<li>There are at least <span class="math inline">\(O(2^{O(n)})\)</span>
non-isomorphic irreducible partial orders of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a warm up let’s see why there are no irreducible partial orders of
size <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> is easy. Let <span class="math inline">\(P = \{a, b\}\)</span> be a partial order of size
<span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(a
\preceq b\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(P = \{a\} //
\{b\}\)</span>. Similarly the other way round. Otherwise, <span class="math inline">\(P = \{a\} \sqcup \{b\}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> is slightly more
complicated.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to think about this in terms of the level decomposition.
The level of an element <span class="math inline">\(x \in P\)</span> is
the length of the longest chain ending in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Call that <span class="math inline">\(l(x)\)</span>. The height of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the maximum level of an element of
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> (equivalently, the length of the
longest chain in <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>), which we will
call <span class="math inline">\(h(P)\)</span>. A level of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is a set of the form <span class="math inline">\(\{x \in P: l(x) = k\}\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> were an irreducible
poset of size <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. If it has <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> levels, then it’s a chain, so can be
decomposed with <span class="math inline">\(//\)</span>. If it has <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> level, it’s an antichain so can be
decomposed with <span class="math inline">\(\sqcup\)</span>. So it must
have <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> levels. Thus we can write
<span class="math inline">\(P = \{a, b, c\}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a \leq b\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is in level <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(a
\leq c\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the
only element of level <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>), and so we
can write <span class="math inline">\(P = \{a\} // \{b, c\}\)</span>. If
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is in level <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, then if <span class="math inline">\(c
\neq\preceq b\)</span>, we can write <span class="math inline">\(P =
\{a, b\} \sqcup \{c\}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is reducible. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(c \preceq b\)</span>, and so we can write <span class="math inline">\(P = \{a\} // \{b, c\}\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> could not have been irreducible.</p>
<p>Now to see that for <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 3\)</span>
there is always an irreducible poset.</p>
<p>Construct a poset as <span class="math inline">\(P = \{a_1, \ldots,
a_{n - 2}, b, c\}\)</span> and order it as follows: <span class="math inline">\(a_i \leq b\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, and only <span class="math inline">\(a_ \leq c\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is irreducible. It’s clearly not reducible by <span class="math inline">\(\sqcup\)</span> because every element is connected
to every other by some sequence of comparisons. It’s clearly not
reducible by <span class="math inline">\(//\)</span> because not every
element of the bottom level is comparible with every element of the
second level (this is where we used <span class="math inline">\(n &gt;
3\)</span> - we need an <span class="math inline">\(a_2\)</span> for
this to be true).</p>
<p>To see it’s not reducible by <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>, we need to know that <span class="math inline">\(h(A \times B) = h(A) + h(B)\)</span>. This is true
because you can basically create a maximal length chain by moving up
each coordinate’s chain in a zigzag fashion.</p>
<p>Thus if <span class="math inline">\(P = A \times B\)</span>, we must
have <span class="math inline">\(h(A) + h(B) = 2\)</span>. This requires
both <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to have height <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, which would make them antichains, so
<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> would be an antichain, but it’s
not.</p>
<p>In fact a stronger result holds: If <span class="math inline">\(h(P)
\leq 3\)</span>, then if <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is
reducible by <span class="math inline">\(\times\)</span>, it’s reducible
by <span class="math inline">\(\sqcup\)</span>.</p>
<p>We saw the <span class="math inline">\(h(P) = 2\)</span> case above.
If <span class="math inline">\(h(P) = 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P = A \times B\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(A, B\)</span> non-trivial then we must have one of
<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> have height <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Say it’s <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is an antichain and because it’s
non-trivial has more than one element, so we can write <span class="math inline">\(A = X \sqcup Y\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span> non-empty. Then <span class="math inline">\(P = X \times B \sqcup Y \times B\)</span>.</p>
<p>Anyway, we can extend the idea behind this as follows to construct
families of lots of non-isomorphic irreducible partial orders as
follows.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; 0\)</span>. Construct a
partial follow out of elements <span class="math inline">\(P = \{a_1,
\ldots, a_k\} \cup \{b_1, \ldots, b_k\} \cup \{c_U: U \subseteq \{1,
\ldots, k\}, U \neq \emptyset\} \cup \{q\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The rules are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(a_i \leq b_j\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(i \leq j\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(a_i \leq c_U\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(i \in U\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(b_j \leq q\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>The idea of this construction is that there are <span class="math inline">\(O(2^k)\)</span> elements in this partial order,
and all of them are distinguishable up to isomorphism. i.e. the set has
a trivial automorphism group.</p>
<p>To see this, let <span class="math inline">\(f : P \to P\)</span> be
an automorphism. Then <span class="math inline">\(h(f(q)) = h(q) =
3\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(f(q) = q\)</span> because
<span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the only level <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> element. Thus <span class="math inline">\(f(\{b_i\}) = \{b_i\}\)</span>, because they’re the
only elements directly below <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, and
we can distinguish the <span class="math inline">\(b_i\)</span> by how
many elements are under them. Thus <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must also preserve the <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span>, and thus also the <span class="math inline">\(c_U\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is irreducible by our above
result, but more importantly now let <span class="math inline">\(X
\subseteq \{c_i\}\)</span>. Define <span class="math inline">\(P_X = P
\cup d_X\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(d \leq c_U\)</span>
iff <span class="math inline">\(c_U \in X\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is still height <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>, and
still clearly not reducible by either <span class="math inline">\(\sqcup\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(//\)</span>, so is an irreducible set.</p>
<p>More, for <span class="math inline">\(X \neq Y\)</span>, we have
<span class="math inline">\(P_X \neq P_Y\)</span>, because any
isomorphism betweem them would have to preserve the <span class="math inline">\(C_U\)</span>, and so would fail to be an
isomorphism because <span class="math inline">\(d_X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(d_Y\)</span> are below different <span class="math inline">\(c_U\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gives of <span class="math inline">\(O(2^{O(|P|)})\)</span>
non-isomorphic irreducible partial orders of size <span class="math inline">\(|P| + 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>For general <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, construct the
largest version of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(|P| + 1 \leq n\)</span>, and just add in a
bunch of extra elements more or less any way that works, and you’ll get
the same bounds.</p>
<p>It may still be that there’s some interesting deep structure to look
at for irreducible finite partial orders, but I think these examples
show that there’s probably not: There are just too many of them, and
it’s all a bit messy.</p>
