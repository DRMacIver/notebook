<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1044619483086770176">I
made a comment in conversation on Twitter the other day</a> that I like
and need to think about more:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A logically omniscient instance of homo economicus” is mostly just a
good user persona to have in mind in your system design meetings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being generally down on SEU, both as a normative and as a
descriptive model, I think think this might actually be a good use case
of it: Treat your system design <em>as if it contains such people</em>
and ask what they will do will tell you useful things, as long as you
don’t pretend they are the only people using the system.</p>
<p>It’s not dissimilar to the principle of design on the assumption that
an abusive ex will be using the system: Abusive exes are not your main
users (hopefully!) but knowing how they will abuse the system tells you
important things about what you need to do.</p>
<p>One reason that this is an important user persona to consider is that
people will tend to approximate it increasingly well as they get used to
the system, and increasingly well as the amount of time and money they
have available to bring to bear on it, so you can think of homo
economicus as the user persona for people who are willing to sit down
and figure out how to actively game your system.</p>
<p>A useful feature of both of these personas is that there’s a
continuum between normal users and them. Someone doesn’t have to be an
abusive ex to behave like an asshole to another user, and the tools for
dealing with an abusive ex help there too. Similarly, if the system
pushes homo economicus to awful destructive behaviour that you want to
avoid, it will probably nudge normal users in that direction too.</p>
