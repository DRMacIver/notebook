<p>One of the hard problems in designing test-case reducers is pass ordering: You've split the reducer up into a number of different passes,
now you want to know what order to run them in.</p>
<p>A lot of why this is tricky is that some passes you just really don't want to run until you have to because they're much more expensive.
I'm currently exploring a solution to this problem that mostly avoids it by just making that not the case.</p>
<p>The solution is <em>budgeting</em> - running a reduction pass with a maximum number of calls it's allowed to make.</p>
<p>The following algorithm seems to work fairly well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the budget to infinity, mark all passes as active.</li>
<li>For each active reduction pass:<ol>
<li>Run it, but halt it once it has made a number of <em>unsuccessful</em> calls that exceed the current budget.</li>
<li>If it succeeded, set the budget to something appropriate. I'm currently trying double the mean number of calls made by a successful pass on this run through.</li>
<li>If it failed, mark the pass as inactive.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If the number of active passes is one or fewer, mark all passes as active.</li>
<li>If no passes made progress, halt (note that the budget is infinite unless a pass has made progress, so this doesn't affect correctness). Otherwise go back to step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>This seems to do a pretty decent job of keeping the badly behaved passes under control while still making good progress.</p>
<p>Other things I have tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Starting the budget low and working upwards causes a lot of wasted work.</li>
<li>Being more aggressive with lowering the budget on each pass does the same.</li>
<li>Allowing just a single pass to remain active tends to result in a lot of pointless small shrinks and not much useful progress.</li>
</ol>
