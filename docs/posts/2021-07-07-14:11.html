<h1 id="studying-the-mundane">Studying the mundane</h1>
<p>One of the things that you might notice about the things that I write
is that they’re often about really mundane topics.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/telegraph-your-moves">Telegraph
your moves</a> contains a significant discussion of why you should tell
people when you’re running late.</li>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-should-complain-about-it">You
should complain about it</a> is about complaining (obviously).</li>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-do-everything">How
to do everything</a> is almost entirely about this (I do briefly talk
about mathematics and writing, but mostly it’s not about that) and
touches on profound topics such as how to catch a ball, how to clean
your bathroom, and how to open a bag of rice.</li>
</ul>
<p>I do not write about mundane topics because they are sources of deep
philosophical insight. I write about them because I am actually trying
to solve mundane problems. I said in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-03-13:55.html">No
shortage of things to write about</a> that “in order to run out of
things to write, I’d have to basically have life solved. I’m uh a little
ways away from that”. This is true. But necessarily a significant number
of the problems I have not solved in my life are mundane, because most
of life is mundane, and I still think these problems are worth writing
about.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say that I’m <em>only</em> interested in mundane
problems, but mundane problems are important, and often <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/life-complete-problems">life
complete</a> in interesting ways, and by their very mundanity will often
have high impact. I don’t know if my writing has ever made anyone
blissfully happy, but I do know multiple people who have improved the
way they cleaned their bathroom and had a slightly less annoying rice
opening experience as a result, and that too is part of the good
life.</p>
<p>A particular reason I study and think about mundane things is that I
think that there’s often a lot of low hanging fruit available for
improving them. People don’t spend much time thinking about mundane
problems, and even less time on how to communicate improvements in
them.</p>
<p>To a large degree this is rational: You essentially improve until
what you’ve got is “good enough” and it’s not worth figuring out how to
improve further. Importantly though, the effort that isn’t worth it is
that of <em>figuring out</em> how to improve further. Often doing better
is lower effort than what you’re doing now, or very high benefit. Once
you know how to do something the better way, it’s clearly worth doing it
that way (if it weren’t, it wouldn’t be a better way, it would be a way
with a different set of trade offs), but that doesn’t mean it’s worth
inventing that better way.</p>
<p>(It may also still not be worth learning that better way, or you may
not want to, and that’s fine. I’m both not that great at tying my shoes
and know full well I could fix this with a couple of hours spent
studying <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm">Ian
Fieggen’s Shoe Lace website</a>, but have I done that? I absolutely have
not)</p>
<p>I on the other hand am perfectly happy to put in that effort, because
I find it interesting, and I have time to spend, and also there’s a lot
of stuff that other people seem to be “naturally” good at that I’ve had
to figure out the hard way, so once I’ve invested all that mental
infrastructure in learning this stuff I might as well keep going.</p>
<p>And… it turns out it’s not that hard. There are some core skills that
it’s worth developing, but they’re generally useful core skills for
life, mundane or otherwise. Mostly you just need to learn to break out
of habits, spot patterns, and identify where you’ve taken problems as
immutable when they’re actually easily fixable things. I’m not claiming
this is <em>easy</em>, but it’s not rocket surgery or anything, and
almost by definition it’s a skillset for making most parts of your life
better.</p>
<p>It does take time and energy, and I’m aware those are both often in
short supply, so I don’t expect too many people to do as much thinking
about this as I do, but that’s fine. I don’t mind having a niche, and I
expect I’ll keep it. After all, literally nobody else is ever going to
<a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/refusing-to-learn">explain how
to keep your flat clean in terms of the work of James C. Scott on the
early development of agrarian states</a>.</p>
<p>(Although I could totally see <a href="https://goula.sh/">Meekaale</a> doing this with Hubert Dreyfus and
Alasdair MacIntyre instead)</p>
