<p>From Lois McMaster Bujold’s “A Civil Campaign”, page 137:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Madame Vorsoisson”, Mark said with dignity, “is a very sensible
woman. When presented with compelling facts, <em>she</em> doesn’t let a
thoughtless emotional response overcome her clear reason.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“A Civil Campaign” is probably my favourite book in the Vorkosigan
series. The Vorkosigan series is largely an “Adventures! In! Space!”
series, but as it goes on there’s increasingly fewer adventures in
favour of exploring the lives of the characters.</p>
<p>Adventures in A Civil Campaign primarily center on a number of
things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Planning for the imperial wedding.</li>
<li>Miles (the protagonist of the series) attempting to woo the
aforementioned Madame Vorsoisson, with a thoroughly inappropriately
military approach.</li>
<li>Mark (Miles’s clone/brother) attempting an early stage biotech
startup.</li>
<li>Many exciting politics as a hereditary patriarchal nobility adjusts
to things like gene tests and gender changes.</li>
<li>Probably some other things I’m forgetting.</li>
</ol>
<p>This exchange is about the third. Mark has just fed Ekaterin (Madame
Vorsoisson) some of his startup’s food product. It is a vaguely pleasing
but mostly a bit bland product that I imagine as being a bit like cream
cheese. The product is nutritious, flexible, cheap to produce, and has
significant environmental benefits. It should be a miracle product that
will make Mark extremely successful.</p>
<p>Also it comes from bugs. The bugs are particularly disgusting
looking. They call it bug butter. The bugs are called butter bugs.</p>
<p>Also, they’re trying to sell their product made from genetically
engineered bugs on a planet that regards mutations with visceral
horror.</p>
<p>Ekaterin has, kindly, reacted primarily to the quality of the bug
butter as a food product rather than its origins. Miles and everyone
else have reacted with horror to the name, the branding, and the general
visceral association of the food product with its origins (it’s vomited
up by horrifying bug creatures).</p>
<p>Mark believes that Ekaterin is in the right and that Miles and the
others are in the wrong. Mark is wrong. Mark is bad at startups.</p>
<p>Oh, Ekaterin is of course behaving very well. It’s <em>good</em> to
be able to suspend emotional reactions and look at the potential in a
situation. However, Mark is conflating how he feels people
<em>should</em> react to his product with how people are actually going
to react to his product. Miles and everyone else are providing him with
valuable insight.</p>
<p>Mark does eventually turn this around, mostly because of Ekaterin’s
help on branding, but without her he would have been insisting that
people are reacting to his actions <em>wrong</em> and complaining about
the unfairness of it all.</p>
<p>This is an easy trap to fall in to, both in startups and in general:
If people react badly to your actions that <em>might</em> be unfair, and
it’s legitimate to feel aggrieved about it, but ultimately at some point
you need to ask whether you want to have an impact or not, and if you
want to have an impact it’s usually better to ask how you can
effectively work with people’s reactions.</p>
<p>It’s all very well to demand that people react to your actions
differently, but it doesn’t usually work. If you want to change the
world, if you want people to use your product, you need to start from
where you are and work with the audience you have. Even if you do,
ultimately, want to change their behaviour, you’re not generally going
to get there by demanding that they comply - you need to instead work
with rather than against their existing reactions.</p>
