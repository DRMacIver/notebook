<p>There’s a psychological quirk of mine that I’ve never really got to
the bottom of. I’ve occasionally noticed it in others, and I wonder how
common it is.</p>
<p>It’s this: Some part of me clearly rebels at finishing things.</p>
<p>This isn’t slacking. I do also slack on some things, granted, but
that’s not what I mean. I mean I do something like 90-99% of the work
and then just… stop. I don’t want to take the final step and complete
it.</p>
<p>This shows up across a variety of areas. I’m not quite sure what the
common thread is - there needs to be some sense in which it’s a “task”,
but it happens for both enjoyable ones and unenjoyable ones.</p>
<p>A trivial example of this is that often I’ll fail to wash up
everything. I’ll do almost all of it but I’ll leave one or two items on
the side because I can’t be bothered to do those right now.</p>
<p>It also shows up on large writing projects - I’m the worst at large
writing projects. I know I write a lot, but virtually all my successful
writing happens in one sitting.</p>
<p>Games, too. There are a number of games I’ve played something like
90% of the game and then “got bored of”. Sometimes this is because the
game got too hard towards the end, but I don’t think that’s all of it. I
definitely stopped playing before I plateaued.</p>
<p>I’ve also noticed this in what projects I’m attracted to. I really
like problems where it’s impossible to solve them optimally and there is
always room for improvement. I still stop before the end, of course, but
that’s now because there is no end. My recent adventures in Wordle
solving are an example of this.</p>
<p>Some things the source of the aversion to finishing is pretty clear:
If I finish the project, I have to act on it. If I finish writing a
paper, I have to go through the publication process. If I finish a blog
post or newsletter issue I’ve spent ages on, I have to deal with the
fact that it might not succeed, etc.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t actually feel like a central example of the problem.
As I’ve shown every day this month, it’s not that hard for me to publish
writing for the public. I do sometimes procrastinate a little on
finishing it, but not much.</p>
<p>It feels like this is because the action of writing it is atomic in
some way - the writing I do is generally something that is short enough
that I can do it in one sitting (although I do often take breaks) and so
it’s just “one” task. The things that are hard to finish are composite,
often done over many sittings.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? I honestly don’t know. The best I can describe
it is that there’s a sort of ugh reaction as the finish approaches. It
feels a bit like being tired of the task, but as I’ve noted before, I
think tiredness responses like this are often fake.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a difficulty with transitions. The sharp end of a task
is something to fear, in a way that a gradual drifting away from it is
not.</p>
<p>I wonder if there’s something comforting to a part of me about an
unfinished task. As long as there are things to do, I don’t have to
confront <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-08-08:36.html">the
real choice of what I do next</a>. I’m always able, in principle, to
return to an unfinished task, and that anchors me against having to make
broader and scarier choices. I don’t return of course. That would
require finishing them, and abandoning the comfort of having something
concrete to do.</p>
<p>I don’t really know if this is it though. There’s a sharp and
unpleasant feeling to the idea of a completion that I can’t really
articulate at the moment, and whatever the reason the result is myriad
unfinished and half-completed tasks around me at any given time.</p>
<p>All I really know is what I said at the beginning: Some part of me
rebels at the notion of completing a task. I can feel it even now - it’s
insisting that I shouldn’t publish this piece until I’ve got to the
bottom of why. I shall resist its demands.</p>
