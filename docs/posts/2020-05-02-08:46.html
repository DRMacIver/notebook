<p>Three cards:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj10.htm">Wheel of
Fortune</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/pkn.htm">Knight of
Pentacles</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/w6.htm">Six of Wands</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_construct_theory">Personal
Construct Psychology</a> we organise how we look at the world through a
series of bipolar <em>constructs</em>, axes around which we organise the
world. For example Masculine/Feminine, Good/Evil, Strong/Weak. A
construct is not necessarily a binary category (indeed usually is not)
but is a line along which we can orient.</p>
<p>Kelly proposes we look for constructs by comparing three things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a construct is a way in which some things are alike and yet different
from others. In its minimum context a construct would be a way in which
two things are alike and different from a third. It should be kept in
mind that the way in which the two things are like each other should be
the same as the way in which they are different from the third. We do
not explicitly express a whole construct if we say, ‘Mary and Alice have
gentle dispositions but neither of them is as attractive as Jane.’ We
would have to say something like this, if we were to express a true
construct: ‘Mary and Alice are gentle; Jane is not.’ Or we might say,
‘Jane is more attractive than Mary or Alice.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(“The Psychology of Personal Constructs”, Vol 1, p 79)</p>
<p>I’ve been finding using pairs of cards to define axes quite
interesting in my previous posts, so I thought it might by a good way to
look at a set of three cards, constructing a construct between each card
and the pair defined by the other two.</p>
<p>Focusing first on The Wheel of Fortune suggests the construct
Impersonal/Personal to me. The Wheel of Fortune seems to be intended to
be more about destinty than chance, but as a non-believer in destiny I
think destiny <em>is</em> chance, it’s just the pretty face we put on it
to try to pretend that it is more personal than it is. Both the Knight
of Pentacles and the Six of Wands in contrast represent people, each of
them striving against chance in their own ways: The Knight of Pentacles
doggedly plugging away at it, persevering in the face of setbacks, while
the Six of Wands rides it to success, but ultimately both are people, in
contrast to the faceless nature of fortune and chance.</p>
<p>This impersonality of random chance is one of the chief obstacles to
using it in many contexts where it would be sensible to - there is no
court of appeal against chance. If it was unfair, it was unfair. Them’s
the breaks. Even if <em>statistically</em> a random procedure produces
much better results than a deterministic one, people find this
impersonality daunting. In many ways, this is one of the big failings of
atheism as a foundation for systems of human organisation (NB I am an
atheist): We can no longer pretend that random chance is the will of the
gods, putting a face on the faceless.</p>
<p>To pick a random page from <a href="https://amzn.to/2KRvRRh">Random
Justice</a> (p. 15):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the lottery has never been adopted as a general social
decision-making tool, we shall see in due course that it has, in the
past, bene used to resolve a fairly wide variety of matters. Yet, today,
seriously to entertain the prospect of extensive social decision-making
by resort to lot would probably strike most people as absurd. “To a
modern educated man,” Tylor remarked over a centur ago, “drawing lots or
tossing up a coin is an appeal to chance, that is, to ignorance.” To
argue that, in general, social goods and burdens ought to be distributed
randomly is to take no account of criteria such as merit, desert,
competence, and need. Why, when important decisions have to be made,
should we place our trust in the luck of the draw?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This impersonality is, I think, key to this problem: We treat a
person as knowledgeable, chance as ignorant. But individual <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">people’s
decision making should also be considered randomised</a>, so the real
question is not whether decision making should be personal or
impersonal, but <em>how</em> personal should we make it?</p>
<p>Now focusing on the Knight of Pentacles, we get the construct
Reliable/Unreliable. The Knight of Pentacles’s determining feature is
his doggedness - he is dedicated to a task, he stubbornly pursues it.
He’s not exciting, but you can rely on him doing the work. Both success
and chance are somewhat out of your control - you can influence them,
but you cannot rely on them.</p>
<p>Reliability makes me think of resilience, because it requires
weathering adversity regardless of what comes your way. Picking a random
page from “<a href="https://amzn.to/2VUQ4Mh">Resilience: The Science of
Mastering Life’s Greatest Challenges</a>” (p. 183):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Aerobic exercise can also help in reducing symptoms of depression.
[…] Many other studies have found that exercise is substantially
effective in easing symptoms of mild to moderate depression.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Exercise helps depression” is one of those pieces of advice that
everybody knows is true and those of us who would benefit from it hates
you telling them - partly because it doesn’t feel internally valid, but
mostly because it seems very victim blamey and doesn’t suggest any way
forward - if you’re struggling to get out of bed you certainly don’t
want to go for a run, and telling you to do so will just make you feel
worse about yourself.</p>
<p>Cultivating reliability when <em>not</em> depressed (or at least less
depressed) may partially be a way through that. Entraining habits and
rituals that just get you to do the work come hell or highwater… may
still not survive a severe depression, but may last into a deeper
depression than mere motivation would.</p>
<p>Finally, focusing on the Six of Wands I think we have the construct
Goal/Strategy.</p>
<p>The wheel of fortune is in part about working with destiny and
chance, both of which are key components to success. You need both care
work (the knight) and fixing things (the wheel of fortune) to respond to
and take advantage of circumstances, and to keep going until success
happens. The Six of Wands is about what happens once you succeed, and is
less concerned with how he got there.</p>
<p>People are very bad at maintaining this construct, often to their
detriment. I had a conversation with a friend a while ago which went
roughly along the lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m really struggling to go to bed earlier.”</p>
<p>“OK what have you tried?”</p>
<p>“I’ve tried going to bed earlier.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s a goal. What have you <em>tried</em>?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strategies here might be e.g. setting an early alarm and letting your
sleep cycle catch up with you, taking a melatonin at 7pm and letting
your body clock hit you when it’s ready, creating an elaborate bedtime
ritual. Just wanting the goal and forcing yourself into it against
whatever habits and features of your life are currently causing you to
struggle with going to bed is not a strategy.</p>
<p>From “<a href="https://amzn.to/2VVfIAD">Thinking in Bets</a>”,
p. 138:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On our own, we have just one viewpoint. That’s our limitation as
humans. But if we take a bunch of people with that limitation and put
them together in a group, we get exposed to diverse opinions, can test
alternative hypotheses, and move toward accuracy. It is almost
impossible for us, on our own, to get the diversity of viewpoints
provided by the combined manpower of a well-formed decision pod. To get
a more objective view of the world, we need an environment that exposes
us to alternate hypotheses and different perspectives. That doesn’t
apply only to the world around us: to view <em>ourselves</em> in a more
realistic way, we need other people to fill in our blind spots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously I buy into this given my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html">support
group</a>, but I think there are a couple interesting points to consider
here.</p>
<p>The first is that while it is definitely true that other people are
incredibly helpful in this, I don’t think it is true that it is almost
impossible for us to get exposed to get the diversity viewpoints on our
own that a good decision pod will provide (a decision pod in this case
is something more or less like support group, but more focused on
strategy and knowledge than personal growth and emotional health), and I
think I’ve been demonstrating some of the techniques for that recently:
You can draw on viewpoints from a <em>vastly</em> larger number of
people if you’re drawing from a well curated library, you can use <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-12:07.html">tarot
or other randomisation</a> to drive your thinking in directions you can
not otherwise see. You can figure out <a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/new-year-new-zine-plural-selves/">your
plural selves</a> and deliberately enter into their roles.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, support group is very good, but the
<em>reason</em> it is very good is not necessarily the different
viewpoints that we each bring each other, but the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-27-07:57.html">personal
connection we have as a group</a>. It’s a specific feature of our
support group that we are not there to argue with each other, and much
of our perspective is shared and complementary.</p>
<p>These approaches to acquiring different perspectives yourself are, in
the “<a href="https://amzn.to/2Ss1rZY">Ritual and its Consequences</a>”
sense, rituals that let you enter a subjunctive world, where you look at
the problem <em>as if</em> you were someone else.</p>
<p>Random page from the bits of Ritual and its Consequences I’ve read so
far gives us page 13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In its ability to play with boundaries - to see the dual role of
boundaries as both separating and uniting - ritual action stands in
opposition to modern forms of social organization, which most often tend
to absolutize boundaries, either by doing away with them totally or by
apotheosizing them into unquestionable and inviolable entities. We take
up this issue directly in Chapter 4. There we open the discussion of how
liberal modes of social organization - and of organizing the self, we
might add - maintain interaction and solidarity by doing away with
boundaries rather than by teaching how to negotiate them. The only
boundaries maintained in such liberal visions are those predicated on
instrumental distinctions, that is on the vagaries of the division of
labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a little skeptical of the tail end of that but haven’t read the
chapter in question yet so will refrain from judgement.</p>
<p>I do think there is something to this idea that we tend to either do
away with boundaries or treat them as inviolate, and that part of this
is that people tend to get stuck at various points in construct space
that they’ve conceptualised as integral features of themselves rather
than something they can fluidly navigate. We rely on other people in
part because we cannot move ourselves into the way of being that they
naturally access.</p>
<p>That’s fine of course. Other people are good, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html">relationships
are key to our growth as people</a>, but sometimes our strategies could
rely more on the impersonal than the personal, which helps avoid <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-28-06:45.html">exhausting
others</a>.</p>
<p>Reliability is one where we often lean on others for it. Many people
rely on others for care work (organisational, cleaning, emotional
support). I’m very bad at it myself.</p>
<p>I think this is a key way in which we can move from the personal to
the impersonal, by moving some of our reliability into the environment,
finding ways to build physical constructs and rituals outside ourselves
that help improve it.</p>
<p>The problem with this of course is that it’s <em>scary</em>. We <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">alieve</a>
ourselves to be unreliable, and trying to strategies our way out of that
seems like it’s setting us up for failure.</p>
<p>Writing this post has kinda convinced me that I need to address this,
so here are some things I’m going to try:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Setting up a <a href="https://howtosurvivementalillness.tumblr.com/post/162396810334/how-to-make-and-use-a-coping-board">coping
board</a>.</li>
<li>Starting couch to 5k.</li>
<li>Beginning using <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> again (I
expect to fail on this one. I find TODO lists incredibly aversive)</li>
</ol>
