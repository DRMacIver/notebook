<p>I’ve been having a pretty bad time recently. I don’t intend to talk
about the details, but suffice it to say I’ve been extremely stressed,
depressed, and anxious, and my appetite and sleep have completely fallen
apart.</p>
<p>This isn’t about that, not directly. It’s about some interesting
things that this has revealed about my personal infrastructure for
supporting my mental health.</p>
<p>One piece of infrastructure is the daily writing. That completely
dropped off during this period, as you’ve probably noticed. I think
that’s… fine. The daily writing is absolutely intended as a mood and
meaning-making support, but it’s designed for chronic conditions, and I
think in acute cases it diverts resources that probably need to be spent
elsewhere. I’m not sure that’s true, but it felt impossible to continue,
so I didn’t. Maybe that was a mistake but I’m not sure what I could have
done differently at the time.</p>
<p>Another piece of mental health infrastructure that <em>hasn’t</em>
fallen off on the other hand is exercise. I’ve kept going to Pilates,
I’ve kept going to the gym. I haven’t necessarily done a great job of
it, but I’ve kept going and that’s I think been helpful. Insufficient to
solve the problems, but that’s a bit much to ask of it. The fact that it
was somethign that I could just show up to and it’s fine even if I don’t
particularly engage with it made it infrastructure that didn’t fall
apart in a crisis.</p>
<p>Another thing I’m tentatively chalking up to an infrastructure
success is that, astonishingly, I haven’t really got significantly ill
during this time period, despite illness sweeping the house. This might
be my body going “I don’t have time to get ill!!!” and I’m going to get
every cold at once when I finally relax, but I’m chalking this up as
tentative evidence that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-02-01-15:09.html">this
nonsense zinc mouthwash I’m using</a> really is doing something.</p>
<p>But there are two interesting major failures of infrastructure, which
it turns out fell apart before things went wrong and I only discovered
that they’d fallen apart too late.</p>
<p>The first is that I’d run out of sleeping pills months ago. This is,
in the normal course of things, absolutely fine. A normal heavy period
of using sleeping pills for me involves taking half a tablet in a month,
and I’d figured out non-chemical tools for getting to sleep on difficult
nights, so when my single packet of sleeping pills that I’d had for over
a year ran out, I didn’t think it was worth renewing. It took me until
my third night on two hours of sleep to realise that this was
incorrect.</p>
<p>Fortunately I managed to get an emergency sleeping pill prescription
on a Friday and took half a pill every night for a few night until the
worst of the acute night time anxiety had passed. I’m now (thankfully, I
hate the experience of using them, I just hate it less than the
experience of not using them when I need them) managing to sleep merely
badly without them, so I’m back to not using them again, but they were
an absolute life saver both for getting through the bad nights and also
for being functional enough to get things moving in the right
direction.</p>
<p>I don’t necessarily want to say that it was a mistake to not renew my
sleeping pill prescription. I genuinely thought I didn’t need them any
more, and I’ve gone most of my life just fine without having them. I
think it was an arguably reasonable call at the time. But I’m sure not
going to let myself be in a situation where I don’t have any sleeping
pills left again.</p>
<p>I think this is an interesting example because the sleeping pills are
very much dampeners for low probability events. The normal events they
damp our are something like 3% probability events, and are survivable
without them. A night like I’ve been having recently where I get 2 hours
sleep are maybe something like… 0.2% probability events. I maybe get a
night that bad every few years. Having several nights like that in a row
is too unprecedented for me to assign a probability. I think it’s a
proper black swan event for me, as I wouldn’t actually have predicted it
was possible - I’d have assumed the first night would exhaust me enough
that the second night I would sleep no matter how anxious I was.</p>
<p>So what happened is that all of the events of medium severity that
happened sufficiently often that I regularly encountered them were now
solved, and I incorrectly generalised from this to determine that the
infrastructure was no longer useful, and this turned out to be
incorrect.</p>
<p>Anyway, having experienced this, I declared my lesson learned and
that I would no longer abandon infrastructure that was a solution to a
predictable class of problems, even if I thought it was no longer
necessary.</p>
<p>This makes the second infrastructure failure especially
infuriating.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was talking to Lisa about how everything was
terrible and I was utterly miserable. Then I went to bed. Then I came
down about an hour later to get something, and we talked a bit, and she
noted that I’d perked up significantly in that hour. “Huh, have I?” was
my response, and I went back to bed.</p>
<p>Then I introspected and decided she was right. It’s not that anything
had become less terrible than it was previously, but it sure felt more
manageable. There were major problems, but I could engage with them
rather than despair about them.</p>
<p>Then I thought about it a bit more and realised that I was an
absolute fucking idiot.</p>
<p>What had happened between those two times was that I’d gone “Oh yeah,
<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/2023/09/08/luck-based-medicine-inositol/">inositol</a>
helps with my mood, and I’ve got a bit left, maybe I should take some
inositol”, so I took some inositol.</p>
<p>I’d stopped taking it a few months ago, not really through any
deliberate decision, it just stopped doing much for me. I attributed
this to the fact that my diet had improved and I was regularly taking a
probiotic. At some point I’d mostly run out and stopped having a regular
supplement regime so it just got quietly forgotten.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I stopped having a regular supplement regime, so I
also stopped reliably taking my probiotic.</p>
<p>Also, as I got more stressed, my appetite was suppressed and I was
eating less well.</p>
<p>So, apparently, quietly, all of the problems that inositol solved for
me previously, gradually and quietly came back, and because things were
actually terrible, and because I didn’t have a good poitn of comparison
of events on and off inositol, I didn’t realise that that was what was
happening.</p>
<p>This is interestingly almost the polar opposite of the sleeping pill
thing, because it’s a chronic problem that gets worse in… I don’t want
to say non-obvious, because the results are very obvious, but let’s say
difficult-to-attribute ways… if I neglect the infrastructure
maintenance. I don’t realise I need it not because of the irregularity
of the events, but because of the regularity of the events. If I don’t
ever take the inositol, I don’t notice how large the impact of it is,
and the fact that my mental health infrastructure is in slow collapse
just looks like everything being terrible.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I have a good generalised lesson from this other than
“Yes, David, you need to take the fucking inositol even if you don’t
think it’s doing something”, but I do want to share a related
observation from the other day.</p>
<p>There are two different skills for dealing with anxiety. One of them
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-20-17:58.html">I’ve
written about before</a> and is about only feeling anxiety in situations
where it’s an appropriate response. But the other, equally important
one, is that when the appropriate response is a high level of anxiety,
you should be able to deal with it.</p>
<p>In this case I couldn’t really say anxiety was inappropriate. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-03-13:40.html">There
was a high level of uncertainty</a> and it was legitimately scary<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">There still is. But also there was.</span>. But <em>boy</em> was I not able to
deal with it. At the time I thought this was a generalisable thing about
me, and to some degree it is, but in retrospect I was dealing with it
much less well than I might have.</p>
<p>So I guess this leaves me with the following question: If you’re
struggling to deal with something, is this maybe because the
infrastructure you’d use to deal with it has collapsed or gone away and
you didn’t notice because you didn’t think you needed it any more?</p>
