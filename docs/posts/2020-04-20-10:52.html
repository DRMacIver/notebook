<p>I recently read <a href="https://amzn.to/2VOS9IK">Come As You
Are</a>, a book about sexuality (primarily women’s sexuality, but it
mostly works for everyone).</p>
<p>It is by far the most <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html">annoying</a>
book that I will nevertheless recommend. It was about 50% stuff I
already knew (which I only skimmed but seemed pretty good), but the
other 50% contained a lot of useful ideas that helped make sense of some
things I only partially knew. It was also 100% annoying and I hated the
author’s writing style. I will grant I am not in the target audience for
it (it is primarily written for women), but the friend who recommended
it was a woman and she also hates the writing style so I don’t think
that’s why, I just think it’s objectively very annoying (especially if
you’re not from the USA). Nevertheless, it was on balance very worth
reading.</p>
<p>One thing that was particularly helpful was the brake/accelerator
model for sexual arousal.</p>
<p>The model is very simple: There are two systems, the Sexual
Excitation System (SES), the accelerator, and the Sexual Inhibition
System (SIS), the brake. The SES is what turns you on, the SIS is what
turns you off.</p>
<p>If you’re currently not interested in sex and you’d like to be, you
need to understand which of these is at play: It might be that your
accelerator isn’t being pushed by the current sexual context, or it
might be that something is pressing hard on your brake.</p>
<p>Different people have different levels of sensitivity on each of the
brake and accelerator. On average women have much more sensitive brakes
(i.e. are much easier to turn off) and men have much more sensitive
accelerators (i.e. are much more easy to turn on), but there’s a lot of
individual variation.</p>
<p>One of the least helpful things you can do is make a mistake about
which system is in play. It doesn’t help to try to turn someone on if
their foot is slammed hard on the brake, and it doesn’t help to try to
make someone comfortable and at ease if they’re already fine and the
problem is just that the context isn’t at all arousing.</p>
<p>The former is particularly bad, because pressure is one of the things
most likely to activate someone’s brakes, because it creates negative
emotional association with the whole experience. It’s also particularly
common, because people (especially people who have relatively
insensitive brakes, like most guys) often don’t realise that the brake
is a potential problem at all.</p>
<p>Since reading about the brake/accelerator model I’ve been seeing it
everywhere. I think a lot of motivation is like this, where there are
things that we really want to do (the accelerator is on hard) but also
procrastinate hard because there’s a huge ugh field around the thing and
we find it massively hard (so are the brakes) and we just end up with
the gearbox in our head grinding. In the same way as with sex, trying to
want to do the thing even more isn’t going to help, and treating it as
an issue of motivation will just cause one to build up even more guilt
and shame around the subject, making it even more aversive.</p>
<p>This likely also ties in to the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a>
and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a>
model of growth, where desire acts as the accelerator and a lack of
safety acts as the brake (and indeed a lack of safety is often a major
brake activator in a sexual context). Given <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-19-10:52.html">the
context</a> in which I’ve been thinking about a lot of the personal
growth work, it’s probably not entirely a coincidence that these
track.</p>
