<h1 id="you-cant-actually-explain-everything-to-laypeople">You can’t
actually explain everything to laypeople</h1>
<p>There’s an annoying meme that, as with many annoying memes oft-cited
by nerds, seems to date back to Feynmann. It’s that your ability to
explain a subject to a layperson is a test of whether you understand it.
I often hear it as “If you can’t explain it to your grandmother you
don’t understand it”. The version I heard earlier was “explain to a five
year old”.</p>
<p>Feynmann, to his partial credit, doesn’t seem to have deliberately
coined an aphorism here and also said “freshman” (i.e. first year
university student). <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Richard_Feynman#Teaching_quote">Discussion
at wikiquote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Feynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to
devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning
students. Once, I said to him, “Dick, explain to me, so that I can
understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics.”
Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, “I’ll prepare a freshman
lecture on it.” But he came back a few days later to say, “I couldn’t do
it. I couldn’t reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don’t
really understand it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Freshman students are already not laypeople, but even so I don’t
think this is a reasonable standard for understanding. It <em>might</em>
be a reasonable standard for the specific context, I don’t know enough
about quantum mechanics to say, but it’s certainly not universal.</p>
<p>But first, lets consider how freshmen already differ from
laypeople:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They’ve got a lot of prerequisites that a layperson doesn’t. A
freshman in a physics lecture already knows a lot more about physics
than a five year old, or indeed most educated people.</li>
<li>They’re prepared to learn and engage with the material.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>is one of the most important parts, because the main reason that
you can’t explain most things you do to laypeople is that they don’t
care. When someone who isn’t a software developer / computer scientists
/ etc asks me about my PhD I can just about explain the problem before
they switch off (which honestly is doing better than most PhDs in
computer science, but I have a relatively accessible problem domain),
I’m certainly not going to get them to sit through an explanation about
the solution.</p></li>
<li><p>is also a major feature: Some areas of knowledge just have
prerequisites. It’s a simple fact. And often there are a lot more
prerequisites than you think. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-18-12:24.html">How to
talk about books you haven’t read</a> has a great section on reading
Hamlet to the Tiv tribe in Western Africa, and how much cultural
bridging that required. Hamlet is pretty much designed to be accessible
to laypeople (Shakespeare was a popular entertainer!) but because these
are laypeople from a different cultural context, it failed to land
without a lot of explanation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>My degree is in mathematics. There were a number of courses in the
final year I struggled with, though I generally got there in the end. If
you had thrown me in the deep end on those courses in my first year, I
would have had no chance, because they built on material that I had
learned earlier. Knowledge has prerequisites, and you have to teach
those first.</p>
<p>Could I have somehow taught those courses to my younger self anyway?
Certainly. I’d have done it by putting him through a four year maths
degree.</p>
<p>This is, in the end, the biggest problem with the idea that you can
teach anything to laypeople: Sometimes the only way to do that is to
first make them not a layperson.</p>
