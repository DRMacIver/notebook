<p>Theorem: Let <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> be a polynomial
with real roots. Its derivative, <span class="math inline">\(P'\)</span>, also has real roots.</p>
<p>Note that there is something essentially analytic going on here,
because the theorem is false if you replace “real” with “rational”:
Consider the polynomial <span class="math inline">\((x^2 - 1)(x + 2) =
x^3 + 2x^2 - x -2\)</span>. This obviously has real roots (they are
<span class="math inline">\(-1, 1, -2\)</span>), but its derivative is
<span class="math inline">\(3x^2 + 4x - 1\)</span> which has roots at
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{7}}{6}\)</span>, which
are not rational.</p>
<p>This isn’t hard to prove but I found my first proof of it a little
unsatisfying - there’s an easy bit and then an annoying thing you have
to do to patch it up. I <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1075013004708757504">asked on
Twitter for nice proofs</a>, and there is indeed a nicer proof using an
only modestly large hammer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Lucas_theorem">Gauss-Lucas
theorem</a> which I hadn’t previously encountered and is indeed very
neat. This states that the roots of the derivative of any polynomial lie
in the convex hull of the roots of the polynomial. In particular because
the reals form a convex set, if the roots are real then so are the roots
of the derivative.</p>
<p>This is a note about the other… I don’t really want to say it’s more
elementary, because in some sense it’s less elementary, but the one that
most people seemed to naturally reach for.</p>
<p>Lemma: Suppose <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a root at
<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> with multiplicity <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; 1\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(P'\)</span> has a root at <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> with multiplicity at least <span class="math inline">\(k - 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Proof: Let <span class="math inline">\(P(x) = (x - w)^k
Q(x)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(P'(x) = (x - w)^{k -
1}(k Q(x) + (x - w) Q'(x))\)</span>, so has a root of multiplicity
at least $k - 1\0 desired (as the right hand side is a polynomial).</p>
<p>Lemma: Suppose <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has distinct
roots <span class="math inline">\(x_1 &lt; \ldots &lt; x_k\)</span>,
then there are <span class="math inline">\(y_k\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x_1 &lt; y_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; y_{k - 1}
&lt; x_k\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P'(y_i) =
0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Proof: Rolle’s theorem. <span class="math inline">\(P(x_i) = P(x_{i +
1}) = 0\)</span> so there is some <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(x_i
&lt; y_i &lt; x_{i + 1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P'(y_i) = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Proof of theorem: Let <span class="math inline">\(x_1 &lt; \ldots
&lt; x_k\)</span> be the roots of <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>
with multiplicities <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span>. Then by
Lemma 1 we have at least <span class="math inline">\(\sigma (n_i - 1) =
n - k\)</span> roots at the real values <span class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and by Lemma 2 we have <span class="math inline">\(k - 1\)</span> real <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> with roots, giving us a total of
<span class="math inline">\(n - k + k - 1 = n - 1\)</span> roots. <span class="math inline">\(P'\)</span> is a polynomial of degree <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> so only <em>has</em> <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> roots, thus we have accounted for
them all.</p>
<p>As an amusing alternative you can use a density argument (the set of
polynomials with distinct roots is dense in the set of polynomials with
real roots, the derivative function is continuous on the set of
polynomials of degree at most <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>,
and the set of polynomials with real roots is closed), but this seems
like overkill.</p>
