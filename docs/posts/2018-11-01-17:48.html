<h1 id="frequentist-statistics-as-a-tool-of-critique">Frequentist
Statistics as a Tool of Critique</h1>
<p>Epistemic Status: I’m pretty confident this is valid, but I’m not an
expert in statistics and I’m even less an expert in philosophy of
statistics, so I’m less sure that this is <em>useful</em>, and if it is
then it’s probably not novel.</p>
<p>The other day I figured out a framing of frequentist statistics that
I quite like, which is that the core of frequentist statistics is
something that you might call the <em>model-based critique</em>. The
model-based critique goes roughly as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If we accepted your argument, we would also have to accept the
following variant of it in an idealised model (where we know the ground
truth).</li>
<li>In said model, this undesirable outcome would happen with at least
this probability.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, the structure of (two sided) significance testing can be
thought of as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If we accept your argument that this estimator taking this value
indicates that the true parameter must be non-zero, then certainly the
parameter being <em>larger</em> should count as the same.</li>
<li>Here is a model that produces data that is in some sense like the
data that you are testing on, but where the true parameter is zero (the
null hypothesis).</li>
<li>Under data generated by this model, the threshold you have set would
still report there being a real difference with probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> (the p-value).</li>
<li>Therefore <em>either</em> you have to explain why the model we have
proposed is missing some essential feature of your real process,
<em>or</em> you accept that your argument will claim a real result where
there is in fact only noise about that often. (which, depending on how
often that is, might be fine!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus significance testing (and model-based critique in general) is
not a tool of inference, but instead a tool of critique - quantitative
rhetoric if you will. It puts forth a counter-argument to a claim that
the data is sufficient to support some conclusion or premise.</p>
<p>The thing I like about this framing is that it makes the following
three things much more apparent:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>This is a valid thing to do.</li>
<li>It’s even a <em>useful</em> thing to do.</li>
<li>It’s not, however, a tool of inference, but instead a tool of
refutation. When something is “statistically significant” what that
means is <em>we have failed to convincingly argue against it</em>, not
that it is true (or even likely!).</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also nice that it’s much more explicit about the relationship
between the model and the experiment. I think most normal framing of
frequentist statistics pretends that the model is in some sense true,
while that is not an important feature of the model-based critique -
instead it merely has to be a convincing analogy.</p>
<p>This framing has also shifted my opinion of frequentist statistics.
It’s not that I like it more or less, but previously my attitude was
mostly “Eh, whatever. It’s not my favourite thing, but I don’t think I
have a strong opinion on this and it’s not one of the battles I choose
to fight” while now I think the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Frequentist statistics is a useful and valid tool and most of the
criticisms of it are, I think, treating it as trying to do something
that it’s not (and, in fairness, most of the <em>proponents</em> of it
probably are too).</li>
<li>Most of the way that it’s used in practice by people with a typical
scientist’s level of understanding of statistics are probably deeply
flawed.</li>
<li>It’s probably easier to get people to stop using p-values than it is
to get them to acquire the level of statistical sophistication that
allows them to be a useful tool.</li>
</ol>
