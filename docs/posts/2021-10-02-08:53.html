<p>Ages ago, when struggling to write, I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-20-10:33.html">On
feeling blocked</a>, in which I describe the phenomenology of writer’s
block.</p>
<p>I’ve been really struggling with writing my newsletter recently, so
I’ve decided to solve this with resuming daily writing, and it seemed
natural to start by returning to the subject. A year and a half on I
have a very different perspective on writer’s block.</p>
<p>It’s this: Writer’s block is not wanting to write, or wanting not to
write.</p>
<p>This may seem overly simple, but it’s not. It just moves the
complexity. Wanting is complicated.</p>
<p>In particular, often some parts of you will want to write, and some
parts of you will want not to write, and the resulting inner conflict
leads to writer’s block.</p>
<p>In “On feeling blocked”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being blocked feels like this. It’s not that there’s an actual block,
it’s that you reach for a part of your brain where the words come from
and it’s not there. You can’t run out of ideas and you know this, but
you try to follow the steps of the idea generating process and the world
glitches and you realise you cut off mid-sentence and have been reading
Twitter for the last half hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sort of distraction is exactly what (at least one type of) an
inner conflict feels like. A part of you drives you to write, a part of
you resists with some emotional judo and redirects you somewhere
else.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3l08rfl">On Writer’s Block</a> by Victoria
Nelson is a good book about the emotional dynamics of writer’s block
which, ultimately, boils down to a long discussion of reasons why you
might want not to write. Typically they’re some variation on wanting to
write something that you don’t feel able to, or that you feel scared
about in some way.</p>
<p>In particular they often come down to trying to adhere to a standard
that you don’t feel you can be good enough for, or feeling that you
should write in a way that isn’t actually very good. e.g. a lot of
people get blocked because they’re trying to write like they learned to
in school and everything comes out boring.</p>
<p>I’m blocked on my newsletter at the moment. I don’t entirely know
why, but the symptom is that I have lots of unfinished posts. The
solution is probably to write the newsletter more like I do the
notebook. I don’t feel able to do that, I don’t know why yet.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’m going to get back to writing even if I can’t
write the newsletter. Life is much better when I write.</p>
<p>The fundamental principles are the same as they always are. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-05-08:59.html">Make
success trivial</a> then apply <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">the
fully general system</a>. The fact that in this case the hard thing is
something that I already in theory know how to do doesn’t matter, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-12-08:19.html">things
can be hard for lots of reasons</a>.</p>
