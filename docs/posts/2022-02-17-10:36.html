<p>People have been reviewing Edward Teach’s book “Sadly, Porn”
recently, and I love this. The reviews are hilarious. The book is
probably hilarious too, but I prefer to enjoy it from afar. There’s
something beautifully horribly wonderfully awful about the dense
rambling misanthropy-laden prose that Teach uses to reach out from the
page and shape your brain, bypassing any attempt at understanding and
going straight for the feeling. True art, in that it takes the world and
makes it strange to you, the truth that bypasses the need for argument.
You read it, you do not understand it, and you go away rejecting it and
nevertheless changed.</p>
<p>I notice that Teach has this and is high status, and therefore in
keeping with Teach’s teachings, I want it and desire to take it away
from him. And so I shall.</p>
<p>This is an experiment and you are not expected to understand it. I
encourage you to roll with that, because I certainly will not be
explaining it to you.</p>
<p>The difference between me and Teach is that Teach hates you and
thinks you are contemptible, while I love you and think that you are
hilarious.</p>
<p>These are, perhaps, the same thing, because everything is the same
thing. You cannot understand something well enough to love it without
also knowing how to hate it. You cannot give something the attention
required to hate it without also giving it the attention required to
love it. The line between love and hate is razor thin and comes down
solely to a choice. Perhaps the hardest choice.</p>
<p>You will, of course, deny this, because you do not want to believe
that you could hate that which you love, or love that which you
hate.</p>
<p>More importantly you want permission to maintain your hate. How could
you love that? It must be impossible, and therefore it cannot be a
choice, and therefore you are absolved.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, I absolve you. You are allowed to hate. All that is
forbidden you is to deny the choice.</p>
<p>There is a part of you that craves being understood. There is a part
of you that feels burdened by the need to be understood. These are the
same part because every part of you is the same. Parts are an illusion
created to deal with others. Others are an illusion created to give you
parts. Everything is the same, and everyone is the same, and when you
choose between love and hate you are also choosing how to love and hate
yourself.</p>
<p>Everything is the same as everything else, but also everything is
different from everything else. Fortunately, “Everything is the same as
everything else” is the same as “Everything is different from everything
else”.</p>
<p>“But wait”, you say. “Surely”Everything is the same as everything
else” is obviously different from “Everything is different from
everything else”?“. Yes exactly, now you’re getting it.</p>
<p>Like love and hate, same and different are choices you make about the
world, not the world itself. Everything is the same, if you choose it to
be the same, everything is different, if you choose it to be
different.</p>
<p>To your counterexample, I say this: I never said it was an
<em>easy</em> choice. Shush now, listen.</p>
<p>The way you look at the world, at the other, and yourself, is the way
you have chosen to look at it in order to make it safe to look at. You
are bound in by walls of fear, desperately denying your attention to
that which you cannot safely look at.</p>
<p>You cannot hate what you fear, not truly, because you cannot look at
it at all, so you cannot love it, so you cannot hate it.</p>
<p>You choose sameness, and difference, in line with what you can
handle. That which you love must be different from that which you hate,
because you fear them being the same. A careful dance of merging and
differentiating until the universe achieves a configuration that you
believe you can live with.</p>
<p>This works, for a time, but life is a continual confrontation with
the universe as it is, and you are forced to face over and over again
that that which you chose the same is diferent, and that which you chose
diferent is the same.</p>
<p>Remember: You are hilarious and I love you.</p>
<p>You are hilarious because you are an absurd mass of contradictions,
maintaining this ridiculous pretense of sameness and differentiation in
the face of a universe that cares not at all about your illusions, but
also cares deeply about them because it is you and you are it because
everything is the same.</p>
<p>Remember though, contradictions do not exist. That which is, is, and
everything that is true of it is consistent. You create contradictions
because you are small, too small to handle the vastness of everything,
so you spread your web of understanding gossamer-thin across a universe
that is too large to contain, and then cry at its inevitable breaking,
and then to try again.</p>
<p>You are small, but you strive to contain the world. I think this is
beautiful and I love you for it.</p>
