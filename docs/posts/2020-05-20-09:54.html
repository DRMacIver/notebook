<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3g53ayI">Voices: The Educational
Formation of Conscience</a>, page 18:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What is my duty?” is made, by many accounts, the entry question into
philosophical ethics. For a philosophy of moral education, however,
entry is gained more fully through the Socratic question, “How ought one
to live?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distinction that Green is drawing in this book is between
philosophy of ethics, which develops ethical theories of what it is like
to behave ethically, and philosophy of moral education, which asks how
people learn to behave ethically.</p>
<p>This is intimately tied to my point in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-10-08:54.html">How to
become a better person</a> that as well as a <em>theory</em> of ethics
we need a <em>practice</em> of ethics. A philosophy of moral education
is not necessarily that practice, but it is at least less far removed
from it: If you ask “What is my duty?”, an answer can assume that part
of your duty is that you are responsible for figuring out how to uphold
your other duties. If you ask “How should I live?”, you might quite
reasonably object if the answer is a little light on practical details
about how, exactly, you are supposed to be able to live in the manner
described.</p>
<p>There’s something about the question “How ought one to live?” that
feels hopelessly naive and/or oppressive these days. Who are you to tell
me what to do?</p>
<p>The <em>ought</em> in particular feels dangerous. It feels like a
question that can only be asked in the presence of a certain amount of
coercive power - as if whatever answer you give to the question, that’s
the answer you’re going to impose on others.</p>
<p>On top of that, there can be no single <em>ought</em>, because are
all different people with different desires and constraints. The idea of
a one sized fits all “best life” seems both impossible and
undesirable.</p>
<p>And yet, I still think there’s something there. Perhaps not “How
ought one to live?” but “How can one figure out how to live?” or “What
tools are there to figure out how to live?” or “How can we help people
live their best lives?”.</p>
<p>I think we underestimate the interplay between morality and emotional
health. Many of our strongest emotions and feelings have a moral
component. Guilt and shame, certainly, but also love and empathy.
Emotions and morality interplay strongly as we act in the world,
especially with regards to other people.</p>
<p>I suggested in “How to be a better person” that improving your
emotional skills would probably automatically make you a better person,
but I think the converse might be true too: Becoming a better person
will improve your emotional health (as long as it’s paired with good
skills for working with emotions - I still think those are the
foundations).</p>
<p>Part of this is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-16-12:06.html">acedia</a>.
I think one of the causes of acedia is living out of line with our
values - sometimes because our values are bad, sometimes because we are
forced to, and sometimes because it is easier to ignore that dissonance
than deal with them. We learn not to care as a defence mechanism, and
bringing ourselves more in line with our values allows us to repair some
of that.</p>
<p>Another part is the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a>
/ <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a>
model. Emotional skills are what provide you with safety to become
better, but others are often the spur for that. Certainly much of my
current growth came from having people who I wanted to be better
for.</p>
<p>In my first read of Green <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">I was
pretty negative about some of this themes</a>. I still think that’s
right - a great deal of his work is about how we adopt a community’s
norms, and my experience is that most communities’ norms are very unsafe
to internalise. My current read is more sympathetic: I still think moral
norms are dangerous tools that are often misused, but I think they also
might be a key part of finding our way to better lives as long as we can
find the right people to develop them with.</p>
