<h1 id="reducing-the-reduction-pass-ordering-problem">Reducing the
Reduction Pass Ordering Problem</h1>
<p>Most test-case reducers are composed of many different passes, each
performing a different class of operation. For example, you might have a
pass that reorders values and a pass that deletes them.</p>
<p>The reduction pass ordering problem is that what order you run these
passes in can have a <em>huge</em> impact on performance, and a moderate
impact on the quality of end result.</p>
<p>I’m starting to be of the opinion however that this is an illusion,
caused by the fact that our reduction passes are too large. If you have
a reduction pass that, say, tries deleting each element, then when you
start from <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> elements you could
instead just have <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> reduction
passes that try deleting a single element.</p>
<p>Once you’ve made your reduction passes this small, running any given
pass is very cheap, and it seems like then <em>most</em> orderings do a
pretty good job. For example, the following seems to work pretty well as
the core loop of a reducer:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Generate the set of all reduction passes that could have an effect
on the current reducer.</li>
<li>Run them in a random order.</li>
</ol>
<p>This works particularly well if your passes are adaptive, so that
they make <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> SUT calls when they
fail to do anything and may make up to <span class="math inline">\(O(\log(k))\)</span> calls when making <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> to achieve progress equivalent to
running <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> appropriate choices of
pass from the same category (e.g. deleting an interval around the
element).</p>
<p>It does seem possible to do better than uniformly at random for
choosing these, but there doesn’t really seem to be more than a factor
of two variation regardless of how clever you are with your ordering
(unless I’m missing an option that is better than anything I’ve tried so
far).</p>
