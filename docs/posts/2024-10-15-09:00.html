<p>In <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-09-22-14:28.html">my
last post on SAT problems</a> I noted that you can remove a single
variable from a SAT problem using the technique I outlined. That is, you
can build a SAT problem over the remaining variables that is solvable
iff there is some assignment of the removed variable that satisfies the
original problem.</p>
<p>This will only sometimes run in reasonable time, because it runs in
one SAT solver call per clause you add, but most of the time<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">That is, for most but not all variables in a large SAT
problem.</span> in my relatively limited experiments
that seems to be actually quite small.</p>
<p>One open question I have is whether you can do better than removing
one variable at a time. In particular, if you have some very small
subset of the variables of a SAT problem, and you want to find the set
of clauses that those variables must satisfy to be extensible to an
assignment of the whole, removing one variable at a time ends up hugely
expensive.</p>
<p>There is a fairly obvious brute force algorithm that you can use of
essentially enumerating all partial assignments up until the point where
you get a contradiction and adding the negations of the contradiction as
a clause. This will be worst-case exponential in the number of variables
in your subset.</p>
<p>I suspect, but haven’t yet got an example that proves, that this is
actually essential and that it’s relatively easy to construct SAT
problems where exactly one assignment of the subset is not extensible to
the assignment of the whole, and this is in some way non-obvious. If so,
you might intrinsically need to check every possible assignment, which
is intrinsically exponential.</p>
<p>Anyway this argument might be wrong, but I’ve still not figured out a
guaranteed better way to do this than brute force enumeration. But I
have figured out how to do the brute force enumeration
<em>faster</em>.</p>
<p>The core is the following function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"></code></pre></div>
<p>This takes some table of assignments of the set of variables and
refines it until it contains only valid assignments, learning a set of
clauses along the way required to achieve that subset. This allows us to
fairly rapidly filter out any unsatisfying assignments, so that when the
set of valid assignments is small we should typically run in a much
smaller number of SAT calls. Even in an absolute worst case scenario
(where every core is the length of the whole set of variables) this does
no worse than a more direct brute force enumeration.</p>
<p>The big advantage of this over previous attempts I’ve made at doing
it via direct enumeration is that it’s not in any way sensitive to
variable ordering. If you’re attempting the obvious recursive bit and
you find a new clause, you’ve now got to figure out how to propagate
that clause up and back down the recursion. Having everything in a
single table of assignments means this is handled automatically for
you.</p>
<p>We can then just run this on a table consisting of the set of all
possible assignments of the variables, but we can do slightly better
than that by breaking the variables up as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"></code></pre></div>
<p>When there are subsets of the variables that also have fairly
restricted assignments, working out their possible assignments first
means that you can do a little better than exponential. If those subsets
end up being mostly unconstrained you at least don’t do worse.</p>
<p>Now, obviously this is all still exponential in the worst case, and
the worst case is actually pretty common. But it’s fast enough that it
significantly improves what I thought was the number of variables that
it was reasonable to expect this sort of thing to work on - in my
current experiments it seems to work pretty well with sets of up to
about 16-20 variables (16 is fast, 20 is tractable) in a SAT problem of
high hundreds of variables. This isn’t huge, but it’s still a useful
boundary to have pushed up a bit.</p>
