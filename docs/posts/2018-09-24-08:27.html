<p>A thing I’ve been noticing a lot recently in how I think about
problems is what an essential role switching between different models of
the system has.</p>
<p>For example, when thinking about groups of people, it’s important to
think about the systems - what incentives are at play, how does the
group response to events, etc. You treat the group as an abstracted
object that is not made up of complex individuals but instead has a few
very simple variables in play.</p>
<p>It’s <em>also</em> important, both ethically and practically, to
think about the group as a collection of individual people. People are
complex and will surprise you, and if you neglect their individual needs
then you will usually treat people badly.</p>
<p>It might be tempting to think that the ideal is a single unified view
of the system which accounts for everything, but realistically that’s
almost always impossible, and switching between multiple very distinct
models can often work nearly as well.</p>
<p>One thing this does is it combats the problem of legibility - the
thing where the easiest way to understand something simply is to make it
simple enough to understand, destroying much of its essential complexity
and causing massive damage - but this seems to be true even without
that. e.g. in mathematics it is often useful to switch between different
representations because they make different features more salient.</p>
