<h1 id="learning-how-to-tell-a-joke">Learning how to tell a joke</h1>
<p>From page 10 of Ted Cohen’s “Jokes”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joking is a “two-stage” art, like music and theater. Someone must
make up the joke, and someone must tell it, and these two jokers need
not be the same. Those good at making up jokes are not the same as those
good at telling them. Telling a joke well may require specific
abilities, like being able to affect an Irish dialect, or it may require
a subtle knack, like a sense of timing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to say that this presentation is particularly important
because some jokes don’t translate well onto the page, and illustrates
this with the following joke that you are legally required to include in
all books about philosophy of comedy or they take your license away:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: According to Freud, what comes between fear and sex?</p>
<p>A: Fünf.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cohen is wrong here, this joke translates to the page just fine,
because you can just read it out loud.</p>
<p>This routine on the other hand is an example of a joke that
<em>actually</em> doesn’t translate to the page:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkCBhKs4faI" title="YouTube video player" width="560">
</iframe>
<p>This both illustrates the strengths and the flaws of the two-stage
art concept.</p>
<p>From a writing point of view, the joke isn’t very good, right? It’s
perfectly well written, there’s nothing wrong with it, but as written
it’s not funny, because the humour is entirely in the presentation. This
is why it demonstrates the strength of the two stage model: it’s a very
good illustration of the verbal skills of humour.</p>
<p>But it also demonstrates that the idea is something of a lie, in that
you can’t actually separate this into two stages. It’s not just that the
joke doesn’t work written down, it’s that there is no joke without the
performance of it here.</p>
<p>This is, perhaps, an artefact of the fact that comedy isn’t really
about telling jokes, it’s about performing routines, but I think this
distinction doesn’t work, and you experience the same problems with
hypercontextual jokes that cannot be extracted from their situation.</p>
<p>What instead is going on, I think, is that for any given joke there
is a <em>skill of telling that joke</em>, and some jokes you can teach
that skill in writing better than others.</p>
<p>Another interesting example of this sort of skill is poetry reading.
Some poems work written, but this one I’ve linked to before in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-06-13:53.html">Start
from amazing</a> isn’t one of them:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFTASR8BMps" title="YouTube video player" width="560">
</iframe>
<p>The poem is good, but the presentation of it is <em>very</em> good,
and the poem rests on the vocal skill of its delivery.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-28-04:40.html">You
can’t write life down</a> I talked about the difficulty in transcribing
oral stories, and this feels like another aspect of that. At the time I
talked about how taking a Raven story outside of its cultural context
would lose essential features of the culture that created it, leaving it
in a diminished and abstracted form, but actually I think the problem is
deeper than that: You can write down a Raven story, but I’m not sure you
can write down how to <em>tell</em> a Raven story.</p>
