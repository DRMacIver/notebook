<p>I’m <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-31-18:47.html">still
working on win streaking</a>. Recently, I got my win streak up from two
to nine.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I was about as annoyed not to make it to an even 10 as
you might imagine, but my actual goal was 5, so I’m still pretty pleased
with myself..</span></p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Well, uh, I switched characters. I’m much better at Ironclad than
Defect<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">So is almost everyone else. Ironclad is just an easier
character.</span></p>
<p>This brings up my win streak for an obvious reason, which is that
it’s easier, but I think it also brings it up for a non-obvious one:
Because it’s easier, I can more readily tell what I’m doing wrong. It’s
very hard to learn from failure without good feedback loops, and in
easier games your feedback is clearer because there are fewer things for
you to do wrong.</p>
<p>In doing so, I’ve noticed a couple of interesting things. They are
somewhat obvious in retrospect, but they were at least a little
non-obvious to me in foresight.</p>
<p>The first is: Once I try to win streak, my appetite for risk changes
significantly. That is, previously I would take risks that had a small
(say, 5-10%) chance of killing me, because they seemed fun or because I
thought I needed to. If you take a few of those chances per run, they
add up pretty rapidly and your win streaks are cut short.</p>
<p>Why take risks at all? Because risks are how you get rewards. In Slay
the Spire the biggest instance of this is fighting elites - hard
monsters that drop a lot of treasure. If you don’t fight enough elites,
you don’t gain enough strength, and then you die to the boss fights
(which you can’t skip). So you want to take as many elites as you can,
but you also want to not die, and success is about balancing this.</p>
<p>This means that one of the most important skills for learning to win
streak in slay the spire is to be able to accurately assess the current
strength of your deck: To ask “Can I beat this elite?” and also “Can I
beat the upcoming boss?” and weigh your chances accordingly, and make
contingency plans.</p>
<p>As a result, since starting to win streak, I’ve skipped a lot more
elite fights,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">On average probably 1-4 per game. In some cases because
I deliberately swerve before the elite, in others because I’m forced
onto a path with fewer elites.</span> because I’ve looked at the upcoming
elite, gone “Can I take it?” and thought “Nah”. The streak I lost, I
actually knew I was likely to lose, because I’d correctly assessed that
I couldn’t take an elite fight and wasn’t offered a path that let me
skip elites for long enough.</p>
<p>Some of this process of assessment is just vibe play writ small -
I’ve got a good intuitive sense of what fights the deck can and can’t
take, and that has a better feedback loop than the game overall - but
some of it is being able to ask more specific and concrete questions
like “How much damage are Slavers going to do to me in the first two
turns and is that more than my hit points?” or “When Nemesis attacks me
for 45 damage, what exactly am I going to do other than block it with my
face?”</p>
<p>This also informs the game more broadly, because when you realise
that the answer is “No, you can’t take it”, it tells you how your deck
needs to improve.</p>
<p>An interesting side effect is that it’s also improved my potion
use,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Potions are one-time use resources that grant you
specific effects when you use them. A <em>remarkable</em> amount of Slay
the Spire skill seems to come down to knowing when to use a potion and
when to hold it.</span> because sometimes the answer when I
ask this question is “Probably not, but you can spend potions to fix
this”. I’ve used potions more aggressively to win elite fights and
bought more potions in shops than I normally do.</p>
<p>I think, in general, improving reliability looks like this. It’s easy
to think of reliability as just a number, but it’s actually composed of
specific situations, and improving your reliability is about identifying
those situations. You improve reliability by <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-03-13:40.html">figuring
out what you should worry about</a>, and come up with specific plans for
avoiding or handling those situations.</p>
