<p>There’s a type of depression that I’ve written about before where it
feels like a restriction of the possible. You want to do normal things,
but doing them feels completely impossible, even when in a more literal
sense it’s perfectly possible to do them.</p>
<p>But there’s another type where everything just feels sortof flat.
It’s not actually difficult to do things - there’s not much internal
resistance per se, but there’s also no ability to orient. The feeling is
not “I can’t do things”, but “I can do things, but why would I do this
thing in particular?”. When presented with any particular choice of
writing topic, the bit where interest or disinterest would be responds
as a sort of emptiness. It’s not an unwillingness to do the thing, it’s
more like a total directionless neutrality on the subject.</p>
<p>Anyway this is what I’m feeling about writing right at this minute,
so I’m just writing down the phenomenology of what I’m currently
experiencing, because that seems like a good default.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things is that I’d lost my pad of writing
ideas.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Bad labelling and organisation on my part got it mixed
in with a bunch of other identical pads of paper and I couldn’t find
which one was it.</span> I initially thought this might be
the source of the problem, so I tried to generate some more ideas, and I
didn’t actually find it very hard to generate a new list of ideas. Many
of them are ones that I abstractly recognise would be good to write
about, but I look at them and try to imagine writing about them right
now the answer is still that empty sort of why.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem is heat, honestly. It’s about 25C in my
office right now, which isn’t scorching, but that’s after significant
attempts at heat management, and I think part of what’s happening is
that my brain and body are going into a sleepy heat crash.</p>
<p>One perhaps telling indication of this is that as soon as I thought
of that and started thinking about steps to take to reduce heat in this
room it became very easy to take actions for that.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Mostly I bought fittings so I can get out my proper AC
unit and install it somewhere useful, and I filled up and turned on the
swamp cooler I have in my room.</span></p>
<p>The weird thing is that I don’t feel particularly hot. I feel…
lethargic maybe, but I’m not getting any strong signals about
temperature, just behavioural responses to it.</p>
<p>One of the things I pointed out in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/labelling-feelings">labelling
feelings</a> is that you’re allowed to figure out what you’re feeling
based on observing your own actions like you would for anyone else.
Something I hadn’t noticed before is that when trying to figure out what
you want, you can partially infer this by finding things that are
unusually easy for you to do right now.</p>
<p>I think a lot of the time this will end up in unendorsed actions,
like doomscrolling, but I think if you cast around and explore the space
of alternatives maybe you’ll find there are some unexpected things in
there that are much easier to do than expected because how easily you
respond to the idea of doing something towards them.</p>
