<h1 id="defects-are-the-responsibility-of-programmers">Defects are the
responsibility of programmers</h1>
<p>This post is an elaboration on a <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265967699743649793">Twitter
thread about software I did yesterday</a>.</p>
<p>Hillel wrote <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/defects-are-not-the-fault-of-programmers/">Defects
are not the fault of programmers</a>. It is a good post and I encourage
you to read it.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, the bigger issue with “programmers create defects” is an
essential issue with the worldview. Its basis in facts is less important
than its value as a “lens” we can use to understand defects. If we know
where defects come from, we know what we need to do to manage them. To
emphasize this: Our worldview on defects shapes our means of reducing
defects. We measure the value of a lens by how useful it is.</p>
<p>So what does the “defects are the fault of programmers” worldview
tell us about our means? It says that the only way to reduce defects is
to improve programmer discipline. Either the programmer is sufficiently
disciplined and nothing can cause defects, or the programmer is
insufficiently disciplined and nothing can prevent defects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d like to argue that Hillel is mostly correct, but bugs should
<em>also</em> be considered the fault of the programmers.</p>
<p>I’d also like to argue that the idea that bugs are the fault of the
programmer, as implemented in practice, is in fact <em>much</em> worse
than Hillel is making it out to be. The worst part of “defects are the
fault of the programmer” is not that it doesn’t help us to reduce
defects, but that in fact that over time it virtually guarantees to
increase them.</p>
<p>A software development process is not just there to produce software,
it’s also there to produce a software development team, and in order to
understand the effect of any given process you need to consider its
effect on both. Systems which have positive effects on the software
while having negative effects on the team, will, in the long run (which
often is not that long - a year or two if often more than enough) end up
backfiring horribly on the software as well.</p>
<p>In particular, defects are a normal part of the software development
process. People make mistakes, people misunderstand things. If you’ve
never had a bug in production then that’s probably because nobody is
using your software or you spend <em>far</em> too long developing
it.</p>
<p>So independently of the question of whose <em>fault</em> a defect is,
the more important question is: When a defect occurs, does your software
development team get better or worse?</p>
<p>I’d like to suggest that any system that relies <em>solely</em> on
personal responsibility will get worse in response to bugs, but so will
any system that treats bugs as not the programmer’s fault.</p>
<p>Ideally we want people to take responsibility for shipping high
quality software. The basic problem is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>If people don’t care about getting good results, there is no system
that will get good results.</li>
<li>If people do care about getting good results, basically every system
works well.</li>
<li>The system you choose determines which of these scenarios are stable
states.</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular if a system <em>relies</em> on people caring about
getting good results, in the absence of support for that, you will <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia">burn out the
people who care the most</a>, they will stop caring and/or leave, and
you will end up with a team that doesn’t care about getting good
results.</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to create this dynamic is to have a culture
of personal responsibility for defects while pressuring people to ship,
and providing no collective support for what to do in the event of
failure. If you treat “defects are the programmer’s fault” as your
guiding correctness principle, you will end up with a team whose
response to that is “Yeah, but who cares?”.</p>
<p>But <em>also</em> if you treat defects as intrinsically not the
programmer’s fault, you do this. “Human error” is a bad attribution in
that you can always find a human to blame, but “System error” is also a
bad attribution because you can always find a system to blame. Humans in
the system are what create performance as well as defects, and if you
treat humans as <em>never</em> the problem, what you end up with is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14773996.2018.1491147?journalCode=tphs20">safety
clutter</a> where people’s hands are tied. And, once again, people will
tend to get frustrated ane leave. They won’t necessarily be the same
people as left in the other scenario, but having a team full of people
who are entirely comfortable with plodding bureaucratic slowness at
every step of the way is also not a great end state. A key part of
getting good results is that you have to get results.</p>
<p>I would suggest that a crucial part of getting to a system that
creates a good team is that <em>guilt</em>. When something goes wrong,
the person responsible should feel appropriately guilty.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that we are all very bad at guilt.</p>
<p>Yes, I can hear you thinking “Oh don’t worry David, I’m <em>very</em>
good at guilt”. That is exactly the problem I am talking about.</p>
<p>Being good at guilt doesn’t mean feeling a lot of guilt. It means
feeling an appropriate amount of guilt, which can range from “Oops, my
bad” to “Yeah that was a massive fuck up on my part. I’ll make it
right”.</p>
<p>The problem we collectively have with guilt, both in terms of how we
experience it and how we inflict it on others, is that we treat it as a
binary with very little between no guilt and massive irredeemable shame.
This is intrinsically unhealthy. Guilt, properly handled, is an
acknowledgement that you have done badly and an impetus to do better. It
cannot serve that function as we currently manage it.</p>
<p>The second crucial part of getting to a system that creates a good
team is that “I’ll make it right” part. If people feel guilty but are
<em>not</em> empowered to fix it, then you once again end up in the
situation where everyone who cares burns out and/or leaves.</p>
<p>Sometimes that empowerment to make it right will consist of the
programmer, as an individual, resolving and learning to do better.
Sometimes it will be about changing the system. Sometimes they’ll be
able to manage it on their own, sometimes they’ll need support.</p>
<p>There is, sadly, no universal prescription that works. The world is
messy and complicated. But if you give people the support they need to
do better, and create a system that tends to improve rather than degrade
the moral, emotional, and professional skills of its members, and
responds healthily to the normal trials and tribulations that the world
has to throw at it, it will probably go pretty well for you.</p>
