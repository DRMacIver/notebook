<p>A concept I’ve found very useful in the past is what David Chapman
describes as velleity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A “velleity” is a wish so weak that it does not occur to you to act
on it. These are desires you instantly dismiss because they do not match
your picture of what you think you want. They seem nonsensical,
unexpected, and do not fit into your plans. But they are shadow-tracks
of passions you do not know you have. Pursuing them, you will capture
your desire.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-08-24-12:11.html">mentioned
in my last post</a>, I’m struggling a bit with figuring out what it is I
actually want at the moment. Or, perhaps that’s not quite right, I know
what I want but it isn’t what I want to want and I’m looking for some
expansion.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Even there I’m not sure it’s <em>really</em> what I
want. There’s definitely a desire to disappear off into a mathematics
hole but I’m not sure it manifests in a way that’s… a fully coherent set
of desires.</span></p>
<p>I thought I’d go on a velleity hunt, so I attempted the following
exercise:</p>
<p>Take a blank piece of paper and at the top of it write “What do I
want?”</p>
<p>Start writing a list of things. Whenever you get to the end, mentally
think “and…” and try to autocomplete it some more.</p>
<p>When writing down things you want, be careful about shoulds. You’re
allowed to put down outcomes you want, that doesn’t mean you want the
action. e.g. my list ended up containing “for my room to be tidy” and
“to write more newsletter posts”. These are things I genuinely want.
Note it <em>doesn’t</em> say “tidy my room”, or “write (some specific
newsletter post)”. At the moment I genuinely do want the outcomes, but
the actual specific actions required to achieve them don’t seem remotely
appealing.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Actually having written that down I notice I <em>do</em>
have some level of desire to clean my room. Not a lot, but some. I might
do five minutes or so after I finish writing this.</span></p>
<p>In general, don’t write down things you don’t want, but do write down
things you <em>complicatedly</em> want. It’s OK to want things and
decide not to do them, or not to do them yet, because you have other
competing wants or practical constraints.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t want to say that this exercise was <em>bad</em>
exactly. It prompted some useful introspection, but it was mostly kinda
sad and depressing if I’m honest. A lot of what I want right now is
apparently “be less burdened”, or “do things that distract me from
problems”, or “not need to keep doing specific things that distract me
from problems but seem net negative”. This is perhaps a useful insight
to have but lacks much in the way of positive direction.</p>
<p>I suspect the exercise as designed is actually very poor for hunting
velleities, and the best way to find them starts from a process of
creation more than discovery. A prompt like “Here are some stupid things
I could do…” is more likely to find quiet desires hidden in the noise
than starting from a question like “What do I want?”, because the latter
risks the big things crowding out the small things.</p>
<p>But I’ll save further experiments for another day.</p>
