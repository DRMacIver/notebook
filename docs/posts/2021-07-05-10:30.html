<p>This piece is off the back of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-02-09:29.html">People
are bad at defining things</a>. You should read that piece first. You
don’t strictly <em>need</em> to read that piece first, but this post
will have a lot more context if you do.</p>
<p>When you try to write using only easy to understand words, it can be
hard to say what you mean because you have to use many words where a
smaller number will do. As well as making it harder to write, this can
make it harder to read, because every time you want to use the thing
that you talked about in many words you have to use all those words
again.</p>
<p>When you do this it helps more people to understand what you have
written, but every single person who could understand the shorter way of
writing it will find it harder to understand the longer way of writing
it because each time they read those many words they have to make sure
it is the same thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes it helps to make up new words that you can use instead of
the many words that you would have to write. This makes it easier for
people to read what you have written because you can use the word you
made up each time you would have written many words and they know it
means the same thing each time.</p>
<p>I wrote that in the <a href="https://splasho.com/upgoer5/">upgoer
five text editor</a>, which requires you to write using only the ten
hundred most common words (thousand is not in the thousand most common
words you see), and it was kinda annoying.</p>
<p>What I wanted to say is this: Using a small vocabulary helps more
people understand what you write, but it makes the text much longer. As
a result, every person who could understand the larger vocabulary easily
will tend to find it easier to understand the version that uses it
fully, because each new word replaces a concept that took many words in
the smaller vocabulary. Reading that single word each time is faster and
doesn’t require people to read the longer phrase to understand that you
mean the same thing each time. As a result, it’s often useful to
introduce new terms that represent complicated concepts you’re talking
about to give people a handle on the concept they can use while reading
your text.</p>
<p>I don’t know that the version with the larger vocabulary is
<em>that</em> much better than the version in up goer five. I’m
certainly happier with it, but I think for short texts it doesn’t matter
that much and it’s repetition over the course of a longer text that
matters.</p>
<p>Also sometimes you have a thing that you don’t totally understand yet
and it is nice to have a word that you can use to mean that thing while
you talk around it. You can show things that are not what you mean and
things that are what you mean, but you can’t say exactly what it is you
mean. Here it’s really important to have a single word for it so you
don’t have to keep saying “that thing that I mean and am talking
around”.</p>
<p>Which, translated out of upgoer five, is to say: Sometimes you have a
concept that you don’t know how to define precisely and want to talk
about, and you can’t just keep saying “that concept that I haven’t
defined yet that I introduced back there”, you need some sort of
placeholder you can talk about.</p>
<p>This is why I talked about example-based definitions: You introduce
the terminology, and you do your best to convey the rough sense of what
you mean and provide examples to help refine it. By introducing a new
word, you have given yourself the ability to talk about something that
you would previously only have been able to talk around.</p>
<p>To summarise all of this: We sometimes need new terminology because,
used well, it helps you communicate what you mean in a way that people
will find easier to understand.</p>
<p>If this feels like an alien concept, very different to your
experience of how people use novel terminology, yes that’s right. That’s
why I’m complaining about people using definitions badly.</p>
