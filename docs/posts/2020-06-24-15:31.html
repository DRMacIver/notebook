<h1 id="books-are-never-finished-only-abandoned">Books are never
finished, only abandoned</h1>
<p>I’ve been noticing something recently: I’ve really started to resent
lending books.</p>
<p>If a book is good enough to be worth lending, it’s probably good
enough that I want to keep referring back to it, and lending out a book
means that for an unknown amount of time I will lack access to the
book.</p>
<p>I’ve turned this feeling into a feature rather than a bug: It helps
me find out which books I really value. If I lend a book out to someone
and find I’m missing it, I buy myself a new copy and now I have a loaner
copy as well.</p>
<p>(This of course doesn’t work that well with expensive or hard to find
books. I’m going to solve that problem by not lending those books)</p>
<p>Part of why this has been interesting to observe is that it
highlights some of my changing relationship with books. Instead of books
being a thing to complete, <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1266093917885337600">books
are part of an ongoing process of reading</a>. The fact that I have read
a book cover to cover doesn’t necessarily take it out of that process.
If nothing else, it just moves it into fodder for the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html">writing
practice</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-09-10:23.html">A Book
is a Tool for Thinking With</a>, so a book is only done when you no
longer need that tool.</p>
<p>This might be because:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You’ve acquired a strictly better tool.</li>
<li>You’ve internalised the book so well that you no longer need the
tool.</li>
<li>You’re no longer interested in having the thoughts it enables.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my experience this is roughly in increasing order of likelihood
for books that were worth reading in the first place: You can hit the
point of diminishing returns, but you rarely hit the point where you
<em>can’t</em> get anything out of a book, you just get to the point
where you’re no longer interested in doing so.</p>
