<p>There’s something I deeply believe, and only very erratically manage
to follow through on, which is that there’s a huge amount to be learned
by studying something more than it seemingly warrants. This is in some
sense the core of the post <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/overthinking-overthinking">Overthinking
overthinking</a> which is what created the “Overthinking Everything”
name that I now use for my newsletter and community.</p>
<p>One core reason for this is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html">existence
proofs</a>. If you put more effort into solving a problem than it really
warrants, you’ve now demonstrated that that problem <em>was</em>
solvable, and you can potentially use that solution in other cases,
gradually reducing its effort.</p>
<p>I think this relates to one of my points in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-30-18:50.html">Heavy
up front learning requirements</a>, which is that it’s worth spending
some time heavily studying skills you use regularly, even ones that
don’t seem like they need it. Sometimes just by really levelling up one
specific task, you should be able to learn generalisable lessons.</p>
<p>The problem is of course… how do you actually do this? How do you
pick what specifics to study?</p>
<p>One part of the answer is to just do which ones bring you joy, but I
think there’s a key problem with this: The specific prescription is to
study something <em>more than it warrants</em>. If it brings you joy to
study it, hopefully you’re already using that joy to prompt you to spend
more time on it.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Right? Right?? Um, OK, this theory might have some
problems.</span></p>
<p>You could study everything more than it warrants, but then you
rapidly hit resource constraings. Where are you going to find time for
that?</p>
<p>I think this is, often, the bottleneck on the joy version too: There
are many things that if <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-03-14:16.html">you
just followed your curiosity</a> you’d find would bring you joy, but
there are <em>too many things</em>, and as a result you do none of
them.</p>
<p>Instead, a better solution I think is to pick arbitrarily and
capriciously. Perhaps, ideally, at random from those that you think seem
like they would be interesting to do.</p>
<p>One of my recurring fantasy scenarios is what I’d do with an
improbably large amount of money, and one of the regular projects I
think about is just randomly sampling a few hundred people from the
population and giving them near unlimited healthcare - extensive
investigations of anything that’s a problem for them, suitable
interventions (erring on the side of cheap and low risk ones), and then
studying the data from that extensively to learn useable lessons for the
broader population.</p>
<p>This strikes me as the right sort of general tool: By sampling
randomly from the set of places you <em>could</em> intervene, you learn
plenty of things that will generalise out of that.</p>
<p>I don’t yet have a very good idea of how to implement this
though.</p>
