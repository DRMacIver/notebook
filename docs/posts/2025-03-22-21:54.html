<p>I’ve been thinking recently about sludge.</p>
<p>Specifically, as a metaphor. When thinking is hard, or motivation is
hard, it feels like trying to think through sludge. Details are hard to
see, everything is harder, and whatever you do it ends up coming away
sortof grimy. It’s a very compelling metaphor. It’s also a common one
for people who, like me, are coming off a stimulant<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">If you have ADHD and rely on stimulants to manage that,
please assume I’m suitably sympathetic to your situation and there are
whatever caveats you need to treat this article about my own personal
experience of the problem as an attack. For me they come with
significant downsides and I’m trying to figure out my way to manage
without them, but that doesn’t mean I think they’re in principle an
invalid solution.</span>
addiction.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Which is to say, I’ve stopped drinking coffee again.</span>.</p>
<p>Withdrawal is real, of course, I’m not denying that. I’ve certainly
had the agonising headaches to prove it. But when you’re past the first
few weeks of caffeine withdrawal, everything still feels like sludge.
But I think maybe it’s just a skill issue.</p>
<p>The thing about stimulants is… stimulants are really good at solving
problems. Having a button you can press and make a whole class of of
problems go away is fantastic. Need to get some work done? Drink some
coffee. Feeling tired? Drink some coffee. Bored and feeling kinda
listless? Drink some coffee. Taking a stimulant amps up your general
ability to do things, and that’s pretty good if you’ve got a problem
shaped like needing to do something and not doing it. I’m struggling to
keep focus on writing this right now, and a coffee sure would help.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Except for the fact that it’s 10PM and drinking coffee
right now would be a disaster at the best of times.</span></p>
<p>I think a bunch about addiction. I’m not sure I think correct things
about it, but some toy models I have of it are really interesting for
illuminating other things.</p>
<p>Take heroin, for example.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Which is to say, it’s best if you don’t take heroin.</span> It’s not hard to imagine
the appeal of what basically amounts to wireheading. Push button, be
happy. Currently unhappy? Take some heroin, that will fix it!<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I do want to reemphasise that this is a rhetorical
flourish and not advice.</span></p>
<p>Except… it’s not generally my impression that the typical heroin user
is particularly happy. Probably they’re at least temporarily happy while
on heroin, but that doesn’t get to be a 24/7 state.</p>
<p><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/i/43763473/choosing-not-to-eat-the-lotus">I’ve
talked about this example before</a> and one of the pieces of feedback I
got from people who have used heroin is that it’s honestly not that
compelling to them when their life is going well. I think that makes
sense. My guess is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_Park">rat
park</a> is mostly fake<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I base this on two key facts: The first is that it
didn’t replicate, the second more important one is that it’s 20th
century psych research.</span>, but I do still more or less buy the
addiction-as-solution model.</p>
<p>But… I’m not sure the thing the addiction is solving is unhappiness
exactly. My guess is that if you compare the average heroin user’s life
to one without heroin, the one without is probably in aggregate still
happier. I think the thing the addiction is providing is
<em>clarity</em>. There is a simple solution to all your problems, it’s
heroin. At any given moment where you have a problem, the heroin will
make your life better, the only cost is that each time you pick this
solution you overall make your life much worse, as an increasingly large
fraction of the problems that heroin solves for you, it also causes.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you compare my life without coffee to my life with
coffee,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">My experience with caffeine is probably worse than
you’re imagining, but even so I am aware this is comparing two very
different extremes, you don’t need to point it out.</span> I am in fact on average more
functional without coffee than with. But it’s higher variance, and on
any given day where I really need to function, coffee sure would help a
lot… But the cost is that I’m highly likely to relapse and find myself
with another problem which coffee would help a lot with the next day or
so, and then suddenly I’m having coffee every few days, and then daily,
and oh no I can’t quit now I can’t afford to lose three days to
headaches.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">If this sounds overdramatic to you, I promise you it’s
not. I’ve quit coffee and relapsed like this multiple times. Even
knowing this I can’t rule out that it’s going to happen again.<a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a></span></p>
<p>Anyway, sludge.</p>
<p>My theory is that “sludge” is actually fake, and is the addict
response to leaving a world of false clarity and encountering the
messiness of normal human experience.</p>
<p>Stimulants help you do things, and they do this by helping you bypass
parts of the normal process by which you <em>decide</em> to do things.
And that process, like all real mature human interaction with the world,
is situation dependent. You have a specific problem, it admits a
specific solution.</p>
<p>One of the things I notice much more without coffee is that there’s a
sort of anxiety that adheres to the basic act of creation. I’m feeling
quite tense right now just trying to put words on the page, even in a
notebook quality way. There’s a genuine sense of fear and anxiety
manifesting in my upper body. It’s honestly very weird. It keeps making
me want to bounce off the process. Everything feels… not hard and
effortful exactly, but <em>painful</em>. Like there’s a literal physical
pain to it.</p>
<p>But that’s not the only thing of course. Sometimes I’m just tired.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn9"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn9" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">No! Fake! Tired isn’t a real thing. It’s many different
real things.</span> Sometimes I know what I have to do
and there’s no anxiety associated with it but it’s <em>boring</em> and I
don’t want to do it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, even worse, I might have to voluntarily do something
mildly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Sometimes in order to decide what to do I have to engage with the
most terrifying question of all: What do I actually want?</p>
<p>All of these are different situations which, if I don’t pay attention
to their fine grained texture, feel like sludge.</p>
<p>And they’re all completely different situations. The only thing that
unifies them is that stimulants are a solution to them.</p>
<p>And if I’ve rejected stimulants as a solution <em>there is no
unification</em>, and their different character becomes apparent as soon
as I attend to my actual experience and try to solve the problem.</p>
<p>That’s hard. If I’ve spent my entire adult life papering over a
problem, no wonder there’s a skill issue, both with finding out what the
specific problem is and also with solving it.</p>
<p>But if I ignore it and just talk about sludge, I’m being <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-05-30-18:41.html">a
victim of metonymy</a>, and worse I’m doing it by conflating a specific
problem <em>with a broader category I don’t have access to</em> unless I
choose to adopt the category of solution I’ve rejected. I shouldn’t do
that.</p>
<p>Don’t adopt ontologies that force you into strategies you want to
avoid. Attend to the specific, and understand your problems in a way
that lets you act on them appropriately.</p>
