<p>I used to be a huge <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a> fan.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">In some ways I still am a huge Beeminder fan (certainly
I’m a big fan of the Beeminder team), I just happen to be a
non-practicing one.</span> For
those who don’t know, Beeminder is a commitment system. You say “I’m
going to do this thing X times a week”, or “I’ll spend at most X hours a
week doing this”, or any other commitment about your life that you can
phrase as a metric.</p>
<p>One of the features of it I thought was extremely well thought out
was the way changing this commitment worked, which is that you can
change it at any time… and that change will take a week to take effect.
You’re always allowed to let future you off the hook, but the fact that
you don’t want to adhere to your commitment right this very minute
doesn’t get you off the hook.</p>
<p>You can, of course, fail to uphold your commitment (“derail”), at
which point you pay Beeminder a previously agreed penalty.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">You can also email them with an excuse as to why you
should be let off the hook and an actual human will read it. Sometimes
they’ll just let you off the hook, sometimes they’ll say “Are you sure
that’s a good enough reason?” and maybe you’ll shuffle your feet and say
“No I guess not” and pay them or maybe you’ll stick to your guns.</span> It
essentially makes the entire thing a sort of asynchronous negotiation
between your past and future selves. You can decide what commitments you
want to hold your future self to, and you can choose whether to break
your current commitments to your past self, but you cannot
<em>forgive</em> those commitments. You are forced to either uphold them
or pay the costs of not doing so.</p>
<p>I think this is often a good model for trying to choose who to be,
even when it’s not as cleanly mediated by beeminder. When I talk about
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html">necessity</a>
it’s really this sort of commitment made by your past self that I’m
talking about. I don’t pay a financial penalty for failing to write
daily, but I do pay the emotional cost by knowing that I’ve let down
this thing that past me has committed to. At some point I will indeed
decide to stop the daily writing<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Typically I keep it up for 1-3 months before it starts
to lose the appeal, and that’s fine. But also… maybe I won’t. Maybe I’ll
just keep up the daily writing forever, possibly with some
modifications. Who knows?</span>, but when that happens
it won’t be because one day I’ve just decided I have enough, it will be
because I choose to release future me from his commitments to
writing.</p>
<p>Probably at some point in that time I will fail to write some day.
That was nearly today, honestly. It’s not been a great day. This isn’t
the end of the world. Maybe there will be a good reason for it and I
won’t feel bad, maybe there won’t be a good reason and I’ll resolve to
do better, but the important thing is that I will acknowledge that the
rule was broken, and this was an important fact that I should respond
appropriately to, and that I should consider this fact when deciding
whether to break the rule or not - ask myself if I <em>really</em> need
to or if I could in fact do the thing.</p>
<p>I think being able to choose rules that you follow and then stick to
them is very important, and you can use them to shape your emotional
reactions to things, and make aspiring towards be the sort of person you
want to be easier.</p>
<p>One problem with the Beeminder analogy<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And part of why I don’t use Beeminder any more.</span> is
that it makes it sound like the rules you follow are mostly about
creating negative emotions - they create ways of punishing yourself for
not upholding the ideal. I don’t think this has to be the case. For
example, with the daily writing there’s certainly a sort of “Ugh, I
guess <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html">I’ve
gotta</a>” feeling because I know I’ll feel bad if I don’t do it, but
then I follow the rule it feels <em>good</em>. There’s something very
satisfying about writing every day, above and beyond the general
satisfaction of writing. It helps elaborate a stream of thinking that
ties thought into life in a way that I very much appreciate.</p>
<p>You can also have rules that are more lightweight or even purely
positive. For example, one rule I live by is that I always say hello to
ducks if I see ducks. Why? Dunno. I started doing it, and I enjoyed it,
so I kept doing it. It’s not a rule I would feel guilty for not
following, but it is a rule I actively try to follow and it pleases me
to do so.</p>
<p>I think you can also do this by creating your own <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/fragments-intellectual-diy">idiosyncratic
categories and distinctions</a> about the world. For example, I have a
mental category of “proper meal” which is basically defined by it having
to have three different vegetables in it.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">There is a series of complicated rules and codicils to
this rule. For example: Neither mango, obviously, nor onions are
vegetables, but a dish which combines mangos and onions counts as one
vegetable. I’m aware this is a stupid piece of convoluted Byzantine
logic, but also it’s obviously correct so shut up.</span> I
try to have at least one proper meal in this sense per day. I don’t
firmly commit to doing this, but a day in which I have at least one
proper meal feels better than a day in which I don’t, because I’ve
decided that this is the sort of meal I should cook.</p>
<p>One of the things I learned with Beeminder is that you can’t add too
many rules at once. It quickly gets overwhelming and you quit the whole
thing in distress as your willingness to engage with the experience
collapses under the burden of it. But for many of the rules we live by,
the actual rule has long dissolved into being just… you. I occasionally
reach for the proper meal rule when I’m trying to figure out what to do
and having some explicit guidance would help, but mostly it’s just baked
in to how I cook and eat. I don’t even think about the ducks rule, I
just see ducks and I say hello. I brush my teeth twice a day, but that’s
not a rule at all at this point it just wouldn’t occur to me not to and
it would feel wrong until I fixed it.</p>
<p>But when you’re trying to shift who you are, particularly when you’re
trying to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-31-18:47.html">more
reliably be the sort of person you can only sometimes be</a>, sometimes
a rule and the ability to commit to it is just what you need. You’ll get
the rules wrong sometimes, and when you do you absolutely need to be
able to change them without guilt, but before you can change them you
need to follow them.</p>
