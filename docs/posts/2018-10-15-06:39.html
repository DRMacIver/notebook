<p>I asked two related questions on Twitter recently. <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1051436665137496065">The first was about short non-fiction books</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeking recommendations of books with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available in paperback form with &lt; 300 pages (ideally &lt; 200).</li>
<li>Non-fiction</li>
<li>Taught you something interesting</li>
<li>Accessible to a (reasonably well educated) general audience</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>At some point I realised that all of the books I had on my list for this and almost all of the recommendations were written by white men, so <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1051451758239723520">I asked a follow-up question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Opening up the subquestion of this because it's made me go "wait a second...".</p>
<p>What are your favourite nonfiction books that are not written by white men? Bonus if they also meet the other criteria of the quoted tweet but not essential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of good answers to both tweets that I will not attempt to summarise here.</p>
<p>I then decided that if I was buying this many books in one sitting I might as well not give Amazon my money for this and decided to go to <a href="https://www.foyles.co.uk/">Foyles</a>.
I ended up leaving with uh, quite a lot of books. Book stores are very good for serendipitous discovery and purchase in a way that websites are not, especially with Amazon's dreadful recommendations.</p>
<p>There is <em>some</em> overlap with both the recommendations and the stated goals, but it's far from total. I ended up buying 15 books. Of these one was written by a man, and another co-authored by one.
Of the women authors a couple were people of colour but I haven't checked that carefully which.</p>
<p>The Foyles haul was:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to understand your gender - Alex Iantaffi and Meg-John Barker (short nonfiction, written by a trans man and an enby)</li>
<li>The Remainder - Alia Trabucco Zer√°n (short but fiction, written by a hispanic woman)</li>
<li>Flights - Olga Tokarczuk (longish fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Give People Money - Annie Lowrey (short nonfiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Doughnut Economics - Kate Raworth (just squeezes under the short book criteria if you ignore appendices and references, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>The Good Immigrant (fits the short book criteria, written by a variety of authors, some women, some men, I think mostly people of colour)</li>
<li>Watching the English - Kate Fox (non-fiction but long, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Estates: An Intimate History - Lynsey Hanley (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Big Capital: Who is London for? - Anna Minton (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Chronicles: On Our Troubled Times - Thomas Piketty (short non-fiction, written by a white man)</li>
<li>A Field Guide to Getting Lost - Rebecca Solnit (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>The Art of Cruelty - Maggie Nelson (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>The Lonely City - Olivia Laing (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>How to Suppress Women's Writing - Joanna Russ (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>We Should All Be Feminists - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie ((very!) short non-fiction, written by a black woman)</li>
</ul>
<p>There was no particular rhyme or reason to this selection. A bunch of these are books that were staff picks at Foyles, a few were ones from the recommendations I'd got. "How to understand your gender" has vaguely been on my to read list for a while. Mostly I just wandered around looking for things that caught my eye.</p>
<p>So once I've managed to plow through this pile (which due to reasons I have less than two months to do. Fun times) I should at least be a bit better in the gender balance of who I read nonfiction by! Race is still decidedly lacking though.</p>
