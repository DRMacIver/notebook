<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2X0wxe2">Voices: The Educational
Formation of Conscience</a> by Thomas F. Green, page 61:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The voices of conscience are various. There is no reason to believe
either that they can be or that they ought to be always - or even very
often - in agreement. […] The aim is not to calm the quarrels of
conscience, but to encourage their enlargement an their elaboration.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I talked before in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-10-08:54.html">How to
be a better person</a> that what we need is not just a theory of ethics
but a practice of it. Green’s book, Voices, is the closest I have to a
book on that subject.</p>
<p>Voices is a book about philosophy of moral education that neatly
sidesteps the question of what morality <em>should</em> be like by
focusing on what it’s actually like: Where, and how, do people learn
their sense of moral?</p>
<p>Green argues that our experience of morality is structured around a
number of different <em>voices of conscience</em>, which we learn in
different contexts and communities, which each provide a sense of
reflexive appraisal about what matters. We have e.g. a conscience of
craft which tells us to feel pride in doing good work and to feel guilt
about doing shoddy work. <a href="https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/2020/05/04/consistency-is-the-enemy/">Lisa
has written about these voices in more detail previously</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve never entirely liked the metaphor of these consciences being a
<em>voice</em> per se. The experience of conscience is, first and
foremost, a felt sense (in the Gendlin sense - a felt bodily experience
of your emotions), rather than a voice. But it is useful to think of
them as being their own self-contained entity. An aspect of the way we
are, as Meg-John Barker <a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/new-year-new-zine-plural-selves/">plural
and in progress</a>. Each of these “voices of conscience” can be thought
of one of the various ways of being we can emobody at any given time,
and we are constantly learning to be them.</p>
<p>Green is, here, arguing that we should <em>embrace</em> that
plurality. If our conscience is intrinsically plural, then we should not
expect those plural voices to agree all the time, so instead we should
focus on getting them to <em>disagree better</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The aim must be to make those quarrels more incisive, more rational,
more passionate,more perceptive, more discerning, and more expansive in
their scope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think for a lot of us engaging with our consciences is quite
unpleasant, because we’ve developed very unhealthy relationships with
guilt and shame. As a result, this exhortation to spend <em>more</em>
time arguing with our conscience probably sounds deeply unpleasant.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I’m so big on <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html">the
distinction between obligation and virtue</a> is that I think part of
the problem is that we overuse guilt in structuring our moral
experience, which is why the process of engaging with morality is so
unpleasant.</p>
<p>Guilt is important - it’s a felt sense of having violated an
obligation - but morality has to go above and beyond obligation.
Obligation is a baseline of adequacy. Ideally we would aim beyond
adequacy and into <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-31-09:20.html">excellence</a>,
and we should <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-22-09:34.html">feel
good about being excellent</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps a key part of this is that our model for these disagreements
between our voices of conscience is wrong. What if a conversation with
our voices of conscience can just be an interesting discussion - a
pleasant chat? Our voices may disagree, but are fundamentally on side
with each other - they are us, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html">we
should not hate parts of ourselves</a>.</p>
<p>A disagreement between our consciences need not be an argument, let
alone a fight, it can be a collaborative activity. If these
disagreements are painful, we need better internal moderation
skills.</p>
