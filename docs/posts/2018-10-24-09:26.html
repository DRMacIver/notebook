<p>(Writing up a vegetarian lasagne recipe I made the other day because I've been getting requests).</p>
<p>This has four ingredients:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crown Prince Squash, cut into roughly 2cm cubes and roasted in butter (you can use oil if you like. In general this recipe has a lot of butter)</li>
<li>Wholewheat lasagne noodles</li>
<li>Grated Mozzarella </li>
<li>Very Red Sauce (recipe for this below. This is the only labour intensive bit)</li>
</ol>
<p>Crown Prince Squash are much much better than butternut squash and are thankfully in season at the moment.
They <a href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/Gardening/Vegetable+Plants/All+Vegetable+Plants/Squash+Crown+Prince+3_242931.htm">look like this</a>.
I get mine from West Hampstead Farmers Market, which is open on Saturday 10:00-14:00, where they are fairly cheap (£2.50 each, which means £5 gets you more squash then you will probably want to eat in a week).
I think a bunch of the middle-eastern and organic vegetable stores in that area also sell them on other days.</p>
<p>To make it you stack layers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Very red sauce</li>
<li>Noodles</li>
<li>Very red sauce</li>
<li>Mozzarella</li>
</ol>
<p>I usually do two of these on top of each other, with extra mozzarella on top for extra crispy cheesiness.</p>
<h3>Very Red Sauce</h3>
<p>This is basically just a rich vegetarian, vegetable heavy, tomato sauce with some variations.
Unfortunately there's no real formal recipe because I improvise it each time, so this is mostly reconstructed by guess work. Feel free to adapt it or substitute some standard recipe.</p>
<p>It's best made the day before and left to sit overnight on the counter (if you're not feeling brave you can skip this bit) and then in the fridge.</p>
<p>The way I make this is very dependent on having both a food processor and a pressure cooker. You can almost certainly make it differently without those.</p>
<p>The following makes enough for two large lasagnes:</p>
<ol>
<li>4 medium sized onions</li>
<li>4 large carrots</li>
<li>4 medium sized beetroot</li>
<li>1 liter of tomato passata</li>
<li>1 can chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>250g salted butter (yes, you're reading that right)</li>
<li>A lot of black pepper</li>
<li>Two large spoons of marmite</li>
<li>5 or so bay leaves.</li>
</ol>
<p>You shouldn't add any salt to this - between the butter and the marmite it's got plenty believe me.</p>
<p>First roast the beetroot. Once it's roasted, peel it (I use kitchen gloves for this - the skin should just come off once it's roasted).</p>
<p>Dice the onions, and put them in the pressure cooker with the butter and lots of ground black pepper.
Leave them on a medium heat to brown.</p>
<p>While those are browning, peel the carrots, then grated them and the beetroot (this is where the foot processor comes in - I just use the grater extension). Add these to the onion, stir them together, and leave to cook for a while longer - say 20-30 minutes.</p>
<p>Once that's looking cooked (unfortunately you can't judge this in a pressure cooker, so I do guess work plus putting it back on if it's not ready), add the tomato, bay leaves, and marmite, stir thoroughly, and then cook on a low heat for an hour or so.</p>
<p>After that, the sauce is ready except for the waiting. Really do leave it overnight - it will be much better the next day.</p>
