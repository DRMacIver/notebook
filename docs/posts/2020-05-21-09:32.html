<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ylGMjz">How to Read a Book</a>, p
64:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have already discussed a rough classification of books. The main
distinction, we said, was between works of fiction, on the one hand, and
works conveying knowledge, or expository works, on the other hand. Among
expository works, we can further distinguish history from philosophy,
and both from science and mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is part of a general section about how analytical reading should
start with the question “What sort of book is this?”</p>
<p>On page 60, they list this as the first rule of analytical
reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must know what kind of book you are reading, and you should know
this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to
read.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors do not, frankly, justify this very well. At the end of
this chapter their argument is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, just as there is a difference in the art of teaching in
different fields, so there is a reciprocal difference in the art of
being taught. The activity of the student must somehow be responsive to
the activity of the instructor. The relation between books and their
readers is the same as that between teachers and their students. Hence,
as books differ in the kinds of knowledge they have to communicate, they
proceed to instruct us differently; and, if we are to follow them, we
must learn to read each kind in an appropriate manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I offer the following responses:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A book is not a person, and our relationship is <em>very</em>
different to that of a person.</li>
<li>The argument is nonsense for people too.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can engage with a book however you like. There’s no moral
obligation to engage with a book as the authors want you to - if you
want to read a book of science through a literary criticism lens, or a
book of literary criticism through a scientific lens, you can.</p>
<p>Even the practical vs theoretical distinction is dubious: I read a
lot of philosophy. This philosophy is, for the most part, eminently
theoretical, but I am reading it for practical reasons, to help me make
sense of things. This requires me to do a lot of translation by doing
the active work of framing practical situations using the tools
provided. This is not a style of engagement that a philosopher would
generally be receptive to (it depends on the philosopher of course) and
they would probably find it quite frustrating. A book can’t be
frustrated with me, so I’m free to use it however I like.</p>
<p>It’s certainly true that treating a science book as a science book
and a piece of literature as a piece of literature will result in
results that are more… in line with the intent of the author I guess,
and you should probably do that more often than not - it’s useful to
learn the norms before you violate them - but they don’t necessarily
produce more <em>interesting</em> outcomes, and different reads will
tend to help you <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html">bridge
the gaps between different areas of knowledge</a>.</p>
<p>The second problem is that the idea that coarse grained
classifications are anything like enough. People have very individual
styles and, yes, those are rooted in their communities of practice, but
those communities of practice are only loosely defined by disciplines -
they’re often very different between subdisciplines, departments,
individual teacher / student lineages, etc. You need to do at least as
much work to identify those individual differences in engagement as you
do to identify the genre.</p>
<p>Instead of asking “What sort of book is this?” I think the questions
you should be asking are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Can I engage with this book in a way that I want to?</li>
<li>If not, where can I learn the skills for doing so?</li>
</ol>
<p>Knowing what sort of book it is <em>can</em> be helpful for answering
the question, but often it is going to be much more about your
relationship to the subject matter than it is about the type of book per
se.</p>
