<p><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-23-21:48.html">I
wrote a post about cleaning my kitchen</a> yesterday. You might have
seen it.</p>
<p>I posted it on discord saying “this is probably really boring”. I
shouldn’t have done that, it was just random self-deprecation for the
fact that I’d written about such a “mundane” subject, but really I knew
it was a pretty good piece, and people liked it as expected. More
importantly, this is the sort of thing I think we need more of rather
than less, so I shouldn’t put it down.</p>
<p>One of the things I’ve been worrying about recently is… deskilling I
guess. One of the concerns I have about AI in its current and near
future form is that there are a lot of things where people feel it’s
just no longe rworth doing things pretty well. If you’re bad at art, AI
is probably better at art than you. If you’re bad at writing, an LLM is
probably better at writing than you. Even if you’re pretty good at
these, a lot of the time they can do a good enough job much faster than
you.</p>
<p>This isn’t a new problem. A lot of progress has been devaluing old
skills because they’ve been replaced with something cheaper. e.g. many
things are no longer worth repairing (or can’t be repaired) and you just
replace them when they break.</p>
<p>The big problem with this is that being bad at things is how you get
good at things, so this creates a real difficulty where you’re sortof
discouraged from getting good at things because all the initial steps
are taken away from you.</p>
<p>The thing is… I think this problem is economically real, in that a
lot of demand for this sort of thing <em>is</em> sortof fungible and
replacing an expensive human with a machine that can cheaply produce
good enough work <em>is</em> a win for many use cases, but the problem
is also sortof fake in that a lot of people experience it as “what’s the
point of producing things if you’re not already a genius?” and that’s
really not how it works.</p>
<p>The “How I clean my kitchen” essay is, in a real sense, not possible
for an AI to have written. I don’t mean it couldn’t literally put words
like that on a page. An AI can totally write an essay about how it
cleans its kitchen. <a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/6cb6635f-a7d8-4954-8392-d7c17fa7ec39">Here’s
one</a>. I got Claude to write it for me in a couple of minutes of
prompting. It’s sortof overwrote and mawkish and you don’t learn much
about cleaning from it, but it is certainly an essay that one could
write about how to clean a kitchen. <a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/baa1d8f0-3163-4b2b-a3a2-6b81c1488134">Here’s
another one</a> where I told it to be a bit more useful. It will create
as many essays about cleaning kitchens for you as you like! If you ask
nicely it might even do one by someone who isn’t a woman named Chen with
a charmingly rustic kitchen.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Claude has a major mode collapse problem where it’s not
very creative when comig up with characters.</span></p>
<p>A sufficiently advanced version of Claude might even do this in a
psychologically realistic and practically useful way. We can definitely
imagine a world in which Claude is much better at writing essays about
cleaning its kitchen than I am.</p>
<p>But there is one very important difference between Claude’s version
of the essay and mine: Claude doesn’t have a kitchen, and didn’t get any
better at cleaning it as a result of writing about it.</p>
<p>Additionally, Claude doesn’t have friends or people who are
interested in its specific ways of relating to the world that can learn
about it and how it is similar and different to them by reading about
its relationship with the kitchen. Claude could have created any
personality you want. <a href="https://claude.site/artifacts/94c552ac-2c51-4b08-9dd6-5fdda565c633">Here’s
one by a ballerina biker named Magnus “Sledge” Thornton</a>.</p>
<p>None of these people are real, you can’t have real relationships with
them. As fictional artefacts, they can be interesting,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Although honestly all of these have the flavour of slop
to me, and I sortof cringe and my eyes slide off them as I try to read
them, so I’ve only skimmed any of them.</span> but
they don’t have a particular human at their center.</p>
<p>Creation is relational, and it is particular. When you put yourself
in a situation where the value of what you do is interchangeable with
anyone else doing it, of course you end up being devalued by machines.
Economics can force you to be in that position, but that doesn’t mean
that what you do lacks value in and of itself. The fact that you
produced something gives it a value in how it related you to the world -
it changes you to create it, and in being particular it also matters
more to those who are relationship to you, above the artefact
itself.</p>
