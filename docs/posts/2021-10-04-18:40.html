<h1 id="book-speedrun-intelligent-virtue-by-julia-annas">Book Speedrun:
Intelligent Virtue by Julia Annas</h1>
<p>This is a book speedrun, where I set a timer for one hour and write a
bunch of stuff inspired by a book. The goal is to get one hour‚Äôs worth
of value out of the book. It‚Äôs far from a complete and comprehensive
engagement with the book, it‚Äôs just me flicking through the pages and
seeing what comes to mind as I do.</p>
<h3 id="backstory">Backstory</h3>
<p>Often when I try to explain or justify virtue ethics to people, I
describe it thus: Virtue ethics is what happens when you treat the
problem of doing good in the world like you would any other skilled
practice, as something that you have to develop expertise in in order to
do it well. Being a good person is not simpler than, say, repairing a
car, and nobody thinks you can reduce repairing a car to a simple set of
rules, so why should being a good person be simple?</p>
<p>This is the book I got that framing from, although it‚Äôs been filtered
through and combined with a lot of other thoughts from other books and
discussions about ethics.</p>
<p>I probably first read it because it‚Äôs referenced in the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/">Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy‚Äôs entry on virtue ethics</a>. This page was
authored by Rosalind Hursthouse, who wrote ‚ÄúOn Virtue Ethics‚Äù, which I
have with me while I‚Äôm writing this and may also refer to.</p>
<h3 id="the-opportunity-for-virtue">The opportunity for virtue</h3>
<p>From page 31:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some of us grow up in bad environments which warp our ability to come
to understand the virtues. Are we not excluding these people from the
community of the virtuous for something they can do nothing about?</p>
<p>(‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>It is important, though, not to confuse the fact that we do not
expect virtue here, which is reasonable, with the different thought that
these people are incapable of virtue, which is mistaken. Most of these
people fail to become virtuous because of the difficulties of their
situation, not because they are not capable of it.</p>
<p>(‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>The present account is not, then, committed to elitism about virtue.
We are all capable of developing the kind of understanding that virtue
requires. For some their circumstances make it hard for them to develop
this, but we we have no reason to think that any are naturally incapable
of it. It remains the case that, given the world as it is, not everybody
does actually develop the virtues; but this is a problem for every
account, not for this one in particular.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems like a reasonable and important position: Not everyone is
good, and sometimes when people are bad, it is because they were raised
in an environment which did not enable them to learn to be good.</p>
<p>But it leaves me with two questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What, exactly, are we to do with this information? If someone is a
bad person because of the environment they are raised in, but are
unlikely to change that, why should we treat that differently than if
they had every opportunity to be virtuous and chose not to take it? In
particular for the purposes of interacting with them, their actual
ethical character seems more important than whether they are culpable
for it.</li>
<li>Why are her examples so bad?</li>
</ol>
<p>To elaborate on the second one I need to include some of the bits
that I left out of the above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are very many people in the world today who live in terrible
conditions of poverty and violence (for example, in the slums of large
cities) which makes it unreasonable to expect them to reflect on and
criticize the lessons tey are taught by the role models they have,
people who frequently (and understandably) emphasize the importance not
of the virtues but of looking out for yourself, not getting held back by
caring baout others, becoming used to violence and cruelty, and
worse.</p>
<p>(‚Ä¶)</p>
<p>We do not expect people raised on garbage dumps outside a Third World
megalopolis to be kind and generous in their everyday behaviour, but
this is, I suggest, for the same kind of reason that we also do not
expect them to play the piano or do crowsswords. Their environment has
obviously lacked the opportunities to learn and do these things, and
because this is so obvious we do not assume that they are naturally
unable to do them. The same holds for failure to develop the
virtues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt know, these don‚Äôt actually seem like very reasonable
expectations to me. It seems to me that people in conditions of poverty
are more likely to develop a sort of community minded approach where
they‚Äôre all in it together. I‚Äôd want to see an actual survey of
behaviour in third world slums - it‚Äôs certainly not going to be a bed of
roses, and low trust environments definitely exists, but it seems to me
that often the worst environments for developing virtue are actually
highly privileged ones. The sort that produce billionaires and
politicians more than the sort that produce communities.</p>
<p>I could be completely wrong, but this seems to be an opinion formed
on fairly narrow stereotyping of groups of people unlike the author, and
I‚Äôm not wild about that. [citation needed] I guess.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also a footnote on page 32 that I don‚Äôt like very much:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paul Bloomfield has emphasize to me that the development of virtue
does require a minimum of intelligence not possessed by, for example,
people with Down‚Äôs syndrome. Such people can develop analogues to the
virtues, but not the virtues themselves. I think that any ethical theory
has to allow that in cases like this there is a qualification to the way
such people can be full members of the ethical community in so far as
this is thought of as a community of active reasoners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt know what the author‚Äôs experience, but most people I‚Äôve met
with Downs‚Äô syndrome have been lovely. Can they reach the highest
heights of virtue? I don‚Äôt know, probably not, it certainly requires a
degree of influence over the world that they probably lack, but I‚Äôm not
sure that‚Äôs a limitation of their character. To the degree that they are
excluded from the ethical community, this feels more like a problem for
the conception of ethics than the people in question.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt have a real conclusion to this section except to note that a
close reading of this bit very much made me go ‚ÄúHmm‚Äù and suggests to me
the author‚Äôs conception of ethics is useful to a much smaller set of
people than I would previously have thought, and the defence of her
conception of ethics as non-elitist seems suspicious to me.</p>
<p>Although fortunately I still think I‚Äôm within that set of people, so
it‚Äôs probably still a useful book for me.</p>
<h3 id="is-this-a-virtue">Is this ü¶ã a virtue?</h3>
<p>From page 97-98:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Being generous, kind, etc. carries no implication that you will be
clean, hard-working, or witty; and none of these traits implies that you
will be generous or kind. It is obvious that you can be clean,
hard-wrking, or witty in a generous or ungenerous, kind or unkind way.
In general, it is a good indication that a character trait is not a
virtue if it neither implies nor is implied by central virtues, such as
courage, but could be exercised in ways which are either courageous or
cowardly, virtuous or vicious.</p>
<p>This is a way of working out which traits are <em>not</em> virtues;
can the theory say anything useful about which traits <em>are</em>?
Earlier I treated patience and generosity as vitues; on what grounds?
They pass the ‚Äòfilter‚Äô test of fitting into the virtues thoguht of as
unified by the holistic development of practical wisdom. Does this imply
that they are really just forms of a more basic virtue such as
benevolence? What would show that they are forms of a more basic virtue
or distinct virtues?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all as part of a chapter on the unity of the virtues, which
is a concept I continue to be a bit ambivalent about. The unity of the
virtues is the claim that to attain the highest level of mastery of any
given virtue you need to attain it for all the virtues. You cannot be
maximally courageous without being maximally kind, etc.</p>
<p>I think what seems to me the strongest argument in favour is roughly
that to the degree that virtue is the skilled practice of being a good
person, <em>relative to a particular conception of good</em>, virtue is
unitary in the sense that you have to in principle be able to do all of
it all of the time. A given situation might elicit both the virtues of
generosity and courage, and one requires the practical wisdom to
navigate the combination of the two. If their is a virtue of courage and
a virtue of benevolence, there is a joint virtue of
benevolence-and-courage, and the exercise of any one of the individual
virtues will sometimes be bottlenecked on the exercise of the joint
virtue.</p>
<p>This is not, I think, the traditional conception of the unity of the
virtues, and I might hold off thinking more about this for a future
research speedrun on the subject.</p>
<h3 id="the-skill-analogy-is-better-than-she-thinks-it-is">The skill
analogy is better than she thinks it is</h3>
<p>In the chapter ‚ÄúVirtue and enjoyment‚Äù, Annas argues that virtues have
a trait above and beyond skills, which is that they have a strong
emotional component.</p>
<p>From page 66:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A skill can be exerised in independence of affective commitment; a
skilled potter can produce pots, and a skilled plumber can fix leakes,
in an unconcerned way. A virtuous person, by contrast, does not perform
virtuous actions impassively and with lack of concern. The virtuous
person not only does the right thing for the right reason, she has the
right feelings about it. Someone handing out money, for example, but
indifferent to the people receiving it and their responses, is not
generous.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually I think this is entirely wrong, and misunderstands both
generosity and pottery.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm slightly nitpicking here, and will delve further into the chapter
in a bit, but I think this is an important point.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs absolutely true that you can produce pots in an unconcerned way.
You know what happens if you always do that? You produce shitty
pots.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm a big fan of Radimentary‚Äôs <a href="https://radimentary.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/pain-is-not-the-unit-of-effort/">Pain
is not the unit of effort</a>, in which he makes the argument that if
you‚Äôre not enjoying yourself you‚Äôre probably not doing your best work.
This is crucial to the development of skill - people learn what Thomas
Green calls a ‚Äúprofessional voice of conscience‚Äù with regards to their
skills. They‚Äôve got a sense of pride in making a good pot, a sense of
dissatisfaction at a bad pot, etc. It‚Äôs true that any given pot that
they make they‚Äôre probably not pouring their heart and soul into it, but
in order to get to the point where they‚Äôre able to make good pots
without much emotional investment, they‚Äôve probably developed pretty
strong feelings about pot making.</p>
<p>Conversely, suppose you are someone who spends every day helping
people, and you wake up one morning feeling super depressed. Nothing
feels particularly good, you have no love in your heart for your fellow
human, and you‚Äôre certainly not feeling particularly benevolent. What do
you do? Typically you go out and help people anyway.</p>
<p>As with pots, you probably never get to the point where you‚Äôre living
your life like this unless you have a strong emotional investment in
helping people, but also as with pots once you know how to help people
skillfully you probably do not require the emotional investment of doing
so every time your help is deployed.</p>
<p>I think probably she is still right that there is a different
emotional component to virtues and ‚Äúnormal‚Äù skills, but I don‚Äôt think
that the mere presence of <em>an</em> emotional component is key.</p>
<p>She goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A learner, such as a child can perform a just action because her
parents tell her to, and without caring about being just, or even
resenting the whole business. As she becomes more virtuous she learns to
perform just actions for the right reasons. We expect the process to
lead to her giving fair shares, not being unduly influenced in friends‚Äô
favour and so on, easily and without effort; eventually she may give
gladly. Suppose that this does not happen: she learns to give fair
shares and be unbiased, but continues to resent having to do so. Such a
person is not just; there is something lacking that a virtuous person
would have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may be a naive question but‚Ä¶ does this actually happen?</p>
<p>My model of someone who does the right things for the wrong reasons
is that they tend not to be very good at it, only do it when other
people are watching, and do the bare minimum. People who aren‚Äôt actually
just and only pretend to be tend to be <em>very</em> obvious, because
they lack the easy and automatic attitude towards it. They are often
stuck at the conscious competence stage at best.</p>
<p>I would agree, in principle, that someone who goes around behaving
perfectly virtuously but with malice and resentment in their heart
shouldn‚Äôt count as virtuous, but I‚Äôm somewhat skeptical of the relevance
of such a person unless they actually exist. I think most people who can
sufficiently maintain a habit of virtue are going to learn the feelings
of virtue associated with that habit automatically, and this may be more
of a bleen and grue situation than something that we need to take
particularly seriously at a practical level.</p>
<h3 id="lives-worth-living">Lives worth living</h3>
<p>From page 147:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is virtue even a starter as a candidate for making you happy? By now
it‚Äôs obvious that the answer is: probably not, on contemporary accounts
of happiness as feeling good, getting what you want, and feeling
satisfied with your life. But we‚Äôve seen we don‚Äôt have to think of
happiness this way. If happiness is the overall end you aim to achieve
by living your life well, then virtue does look like a very obvious
starter, for it looks like a better idea to be loyal and sincere than to
be disloyal and deceptive. It is absurd to think that we really have no
more reason to acquire the virtues than not when we are thinking about
how best to live. Rosalind Hursthouse has made the point forcefully: we
want our children to grow up honest and brave, rather than shifty and
cowardly, and we bring them up to have these virtues (as far as we can)
not just for our own sake, in order to be able to rely on them in
pursuing our own interests, but for their sae, because we think that
they will live better lives being honest and brave rather than being
shifty and cowardly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There seems something to this.</p>
<p>I started from the claim that virtue ethics was the skill of ‚Äúdoing
good in the world‚Äù, but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it
is the skill of leading a good life.</p>
<p>She goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When we are thinking of a happy life, then, it is just common sense
that we want ourselves and our children to have the virtues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree, but perhaps I‚Äôm not entirely sure why.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The intuitive place to start is the ordinary, commonplace assumption
that a person‚Äôs life will, to put it generally, <em>go better</em> if
they have the virtues - if they are generous and brave, for example -
than if they don‚Äôt.</p>
<p>‚Ä¶ we moderns have come to have a problematic conception of happiness.
On the one hand, we think of it as an overall end to be achieved in
living a happy life, and to this extent we can make ready sense of the
idea that living a good life is a way of living a happy life.(‚Ä¶) But on
the other hand we also have another, more passive notion of happiness -
the more recent idea that happiness is pleasant feeling, or getting what
you want, or being satisfied with your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don‚Äôt really understand why she thinks these are in tension. I
don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs <em>wrong</em> necessarily, I just don‚Äôt understand
here.</p>
<p>In particular I think the thing that confuses me is that ‚Äúbeing
satisfied with your life‚Äù seems inextricably bound up with the question
of living a good life? What does it mean to be dissatisfied with your
life except to have judged it to not be a good one? This seems to tie in
again to the ideas of <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia">burnout as
acedia</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-03-08:59.html">moral
disorder</a>.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-and-notes-on-the-format">Conclusion and notes on the
format</h3>
<p>Honestly I think I‚Äôm coming to the, somewhat unsurprising, conclusion
that I cannot really do a good book justice in an hour, especially not
one like this where I probably last read it in detail over a year ago.
Certainly the format of randomly flipping through the book and writing
based on prompts doesn‚Äôt seem to be doing it.</p>
<p>That isn‚Äôt necessarily bad. This still produces a set of interesting
thoughts and writing. But perhaps the random book prompt is enough on
its own.</p>
<p>I think I might in future try something closer to Lucy‚Äôs original
conception of the research speedruns, and might try a different format
for book speedruns. I‚Äôm not yet sure what though.</p>
<p>Two questions that might make interesting future speedruns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity of the virtues: What is it, and is it true?</li>
<li>What exactly is the eudaimonist account of human happiness /
flourishing?</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôll probably try doing another speedrun on this book about each of
those questions specifically.</p>
