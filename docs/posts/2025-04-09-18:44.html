<p>Recently Dave, Lisa, and I, were all helping sort through my parents’
giant boxes of books that have been sitting untouched for years to
decades. We were sorting them into various dubious ontologies - roughly…
worth keeping, worth trying to sell, worth giving away, bin. Dave and
Lisa in particular were trying to hunt out any gems that looked worth
selling.</p>
<p>At some point, Lisa hands me this tiny battered book of some cheap
adventure novel and said “Well, this one isn’t worth anything to
anyone.”</p>
<p>She was, I think, unprepared for the look of absolute delight on my
face as I grabbed it off her. “I’ve been trying to find this for so
long!” I said.</p>
<p>Anyway, let me backtrack 35 years or so.</p>
<p>It’s extremely on brand that one of my first really coherent memories
is of learning to read in my head.</p>
<p>My school had a reading system. It was a whole thing - there was a
box of books, you picked what book you wanted, then you had to read it,
log your reading of it, and return it when you were done.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to know that I <em>hated</em> this. I dragged my
heels over it and had to be nagged into reading. Couldn’t stand reading,
me.</p>
<p>Anyway, one evening I was reading out loud to mum, begrudgingly, and
complained about this. I don’t remember my specific complaint, but she
told me that I didn’t have to read out loud to her if I didn’t want to,
I could just read books in my head. I said “Oh, OK!” or words to that
effect, sent her away, and finished the book.</p>
<p>It didn’t take me long to finish the rest of the books in that box
after that, and I quickly turned from a kid who hated reading to one who
was regularly getting through giant doorstopper books.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Not, you understand, good ones. I read a lot of Robert
Jordan and Brian Lumley (don’t tell my parents about the second one.
They were not age appropriate) and other authors of similar quality
levels. My love of SFF trash continues to this day.</span></p>
<p>It was a pretty life-defining moment - I’m sure I’d have had it at
some point, but that was the specific point at which I had it, and it
sticks in my mind.</p>
<p>I could even tell you quite a lot about the book that I was reading.
It was quite a short book, about some British soldier who is trying to
ship logs down from a mountain and wants to pass them through some
underground river, but they get lost in the middle, so he rides a log
through and finds a giant whirlpool there.</p>
<p>I’ve tried multiple times over the years to find it - asked around on
reddit, did a bunch of searching. Never could find it. I can’t remember
if I ever asked Claude or ChatGPT, but just testing it now Claude
straight up hallucinates an answer.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It says that it’s Rudyard Kipling’s “The Man Who Would
Be King”. It’s not.</span> I’d asked my parents
about it but they had no specific memory of this event at all, let alone
what the book was.</p>
<p>I was for a while half-convinced this was a fake memory.</p>
<p>And then, totally unexpectedly, Lisa just handed me the book.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">“But David”, you may ask, “if it was a book from the
school reading box, why did <em>you</em> have it? That is an excellent
question. I have no idea. But it does have a sticker on it with my
school form so I’m pretty sure I should have returned it to a box and
didn’t.</span></p>
<p>I think this is another variant on the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-07-17:35.html">digital
object permanence</a> thing. If I’d read this book on a kindle, there is
no chance that I would ever have found in this way,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I mean I could have searched in my kindle library, but
do you want to take a bet that Amazon will maintain another 35 years of
continuity of archive? Admittedly they’re doing OK with the 15 they’ve
got so far, but I am not wildly confident. They also have a history of
disappearing things that you’ve bought.</span> but
because the book just exists as a physical object in the world, it could
just stick around in my parents’ house until I found it again.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It wasn’t even the only book I found this way! I was
also trying and failing to remember the name of Karen Traviss’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wess%27Har">Wess’har books</a>, and
found “City of Pearl” there, which helped me track down the whole
thing.</span></p>
<p>The book is “The Cave of Death”, by Ian Serrallier. It’s very little
wonder that I couldn’t find it, because it barely exists. It’s part of
the “Wide Horizon Reading Scheme”, which I can provide very little
evidence of being a real thing that really existed other than a
scattering of other books with the same labelling. It’s a retelling of a
story originally written by J. H. Williams, in “In Quest of a Mermaid”.
I originally thought it was an extract, and felt moderately grumpy about
Ian Serraillier taking credit for it by being the only name on the
cover, but actually having now acquired a copy of the original, it seems
to be the same story entirely rewritten. I assume to make it more
self-contained and accessible to children, but I don’t know.</p>
<p>It’s in many ways quite an interesting story. It’s very “boys own
adventures” and quite colonialist, but… fundamentally it’s a children’s
story about an engineering problem, and that feels rare to me.</p>
<p>Even the colonialism is surprisingly interesting - yes, it’s a book
about a white British soldier leading a team of “natives” in Burma,
assisted by a bunch of itinerant Chinese workers. Yes, there’s a whole
bunch of racial stereotyping going on it. But… the fundamental message
about race relations in it seems to be “different cultures have
different beliefs, but they’re generally still good people, and you’ve
got to respect their beliefs in order to work with them”. I’m not going
to claim it’s completely unproblematic - the author would certainly get
cancelled for writing such a book today - but it genuinely seems like
quite a positive message for its time and probably quite a lot better
than many things written today.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And way less bad than, say, Narnia. All of this would
have completely gone over my head at the time though, as evidenced by
the fact that I was <em>living in Saudi Arabia</em> when reading the
Narnia books and didn’t notice the islamaphobia. In my defence I also
didn’t notice the Christianity.</span></p>
<p>But I think the really interesting thing for me about this whole
thing is not the specific book, but the degree to which figuring out
your past is just intertwined with actual mundane history, and how much
of history is bordering on lost because it’s not, as Lisa said, really
worth anything to anyone. This is an obscure book from an obscure
series. Of course I couldn’t find it.</p>
<p>Except, of course, I totally could have. I bet you if I found a
research librarian and gave them a couple hundred pounds, they’d have
found the book for me in a few weeks, especially these days. I’m not
sure this possibility even really occurred to me as a live one, but in
retrospect it was very possible. I find these sorts of questions
interesting - things which clearly have an empirical answer, and finding
out the empirical answer is entirely within your means,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Although! This is only true in this case <em>if the
answer is positive</em>. If it turns out I’d dreamed the whole thing and
the book didn’t exist, establishing that with any degree of certainty
would be very costly.</span> but
it’s just not clearly worth it. My go to example of this is look at a
random person passing you on the street, what’s their name? You could
just go ask them. It would be weird, but they’d probably tell you.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And if they don’t, you can probably still find out!
Probably not ethically, possibly not without being arrested, but you
can.</span> And yet you don’t do it, because the
question is just an idle fancy, and the effort isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>I think it’s often worth doing things that seem like they’re not
worth it, and this seems like a potentially good learning opportunity.
Even if the answer to the question isn’t worth the cost, maybe the
experience of figuring out how to answer it is. If I’d thought to ask a
research librarian of some sort about this, yes they’d have found the
book, but also I’d have learned more about how to interact with research
librarians, and that would in and of itself been worth it even if
finding the book was not.</p>
<p>I don’t know if going to ask a random stranger on the street their
name would be a good experience in the same way, but it seems like it
might be. It seems harmless, and I think generally figuring out how to
take greyed out options is good for you.</p>
<p>I think that, perhaps, it would be good to notice such questions as
they arise, and every now and then even if it doesn’t seem worth it to
try to answer the question, answer it anyway, and see how that changes
you.</p>
