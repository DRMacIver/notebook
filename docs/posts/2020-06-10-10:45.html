<p>From Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fate. Fates, the: The Greeks and Romans supposed there were three
Parcae or Fates, who arbitrarily controlled the birth, life and death of
everyone. They were CLOTHO, LACHESIS and ATROPOS. They are sometimes
called the ‘cruel Fates’ because they paid no head to anyone’s
wishes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking up each of these individually:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Atropos (Greek, ‘not turning’, ‘unchangeable’). In Greek mythology
the eldest of the three FATES, the the one who severs the thread of
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Clotho (Greek klothein, ‘to draw thread’, ‘to spin’). One of the
three FATES in classic mythology. She presided over birth and drew from
her distaff the thread of life. (See also Atropos, Lachesis)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Lachesis. One of the three FATES, and the one who spins life’s thread
and determines its length. Her name represents Greek <em>lakhesis</em>,
‘destiny’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing I notice is how utterly inconsistent the formatting is on
the three fates. Only Clotho references the other two. Lachesis has a
different formatting for the Greek representation of her name. That’s by
the by though.</p>
<p>(By the by. Incidentally. ‘By-’ can often denote something subsidiary
or secondary, such as: by-election, an election in a single
constituency; by-play, the secondary action in a play; by-product, a
subsidiary product; and byroad, a minor road)</p>
<p>I’ve talked about <a href="https://amzn.to/2TCbsoa">Random
Justice</a> before (e.g. in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-23-07:48.html">Proportionality
and identity</a>), and about its point that one of the problems with
lotteries for decision making is that they are a bit too arbitrary and
impersonal in their fairness.</p>
<p>I still haven’t got around to reading The Secret of our Success but
reviews of it (e.g. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/">Scott
Alexander’s review</a> and <a href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html">Scholar’s
Stage’s review</a>) exposed me to its idea that one of the historic
functions of divination is to introduce randomisation into your decision
making, and the personification of it as a message from the gods was
part of how you got over the unfairness of it.</p>
<p>Given that, it’s interesting (if not entirely surprising) that the
personifications of chance are the <em>cruel</em> fates, who you can’t
argue with.</p>
<p>It seems like often one of the ways we deal with things is to
personify them - treat them as an actual person. This works varyingly
well. Sometimes it drives you to do useful activities like divination,
where the reason it works is unrelated to the claimed purpose driven by
that personification, but sometimes is causes you to treat objective
reality as if it could be argued with, and that doesn’t work out so
great.</p>
<p>“Facts don’t care about your feelings” is a bad meme because facts
are socially constructed statements about the underlying reality. But
it’s true that the underlying reality does not, necessarily, care much
what you think of it - a volcano is going to erupt no matter what you
sacrifice to it, a pandemic is going to pandemic regardless of whether
you’re bored of it.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem is that we’re used to the giant
impersonal powers that control our fates being made out of people.
Politics, capitalism, etc. aren’t necessarily any less prone to crushing
us with utter indifference to our lives, but that’s because it feels
like that’s because the people involved in those systems <em>don’t</em>
care. They could, in principle, be made to care if we exerted enough
power over them (e.g. via protest). Whether or not that caring would
result in systemic change is a bit more of a question mark, but the
possibility is at least there.</p>
<p>A natural disaster has no such potential to care. Yellowstone could
erupt tomorrow killing us all, and it really doesn’t matter how
problematic we think that is.</p>
<p>The temptation to personify is still there, and I think as long as we
don’t take it too seriously it’s probably fine and maybe useful (omg
coronachan is so mean), but it’s important to remember: Fate is not
cruel, fate is not kind, she isn’t a person at all. The fates don’t care
about your feelings.</p>
