<p>I’m a big fan of daily writing. I think it does things that almost
any other writing frequency doesn’t manage, and I like to keep it up
when I can. I’ve done it pretty well this year, with a few days missed
and made up for the previous day, but by and large I’ve managed the
daily habit if we allow for that cheat rule. Some of the posts have been
phoned in, a lot of them have been cobbled together from whatever spare
material I’ve had around, but a lot of them have been novel and some of
them have been good, and there’s even some overlap between those two
categories. Even the ones that aren’t either have felt at least lightly
worth doing.</p>
<p>Then, as you might have noticed, I didn’t write anything for five
days. There’ve been reasons. They don’t matter right now. What I want to
talk about is the experience of resuming after a break like that.</p>
<p>The first thing is that I have no intention of making up those
missing days. In fact, I’m actively declaring that I will <em>not</em>
make up those missing days. It would be a bad idea. The streak is
broken, in a way that a day of catch up does not count as breaking, and
that’s fine.</p>
<p>The problem with daily writing is that it turns writing into a streak
maintenance problem. The measure of your success is how long you’ve
managed to keep the streak going, and you are motivated to make number
go up.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, what this means is that the longer the streak’s been
going for, the worst losing it feels.</p>
