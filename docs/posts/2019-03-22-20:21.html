<p>This was an interesting book, and I intend to keep it for reference,
but there was a lot I disliked about it. Given that plenty of people
rave about how good it is, I’m mostly going to mention what I disliked,
but bear in mind that I not only am glad that I read it but it’s even
staying on my shelves.</p>
<p>It’s thought provoking and reasonably well written, and it helped put
some personal stories on a number of aspects of trauma that I was not
previously aware of. This was very helpful for fleshing out my intuitive
sense of what trauma looks and feels like in other people, and I found
that quite valuable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have three fairly major complaints with the book,
which sharply limited what I was able to get out of it beyond that. The
first is about the content, the second is about the author, and the
third is about the relationship between the two.</p>
<p>My complaint about the content is that this is not a book about
therapy, this is a book of stories about people in therapy. Many of the
stories in some way touch on an important feature of therapy but, and I
cannot emphasise this enough, they do not <em>illustrate</em> a point of
therapy. The types of therapy mentioned in this book are many and
varied, and you will learn barely anything about any of them.</p>
<p>The second is that the author thinks he is very interesting and wants
to make sure you know this. There is a type of didactism where the
primary thing you are trying to teach is that you are very clever and
people should respect you, and this book is very much of that type. In
particular he drops names so hard that the rate is almost names dropped
per <em>page</em>, not per chapter.</p>
<p>The third is that he seems extremely credulous about the therapies he
is writing about. The strongest statement of doubt he ever expresses is
“This works really well but we have no idea why”. If he is to believed,
we live in a world where there are a huge number of different therapies,
all of which work wonders, and the only thing stopping us fixing
everyone’s problems is lack of resources. It seems plausible that this
is at least <em>somewhat</em> true and that we are currently resource
constrained and many more people should be in therapy than currently
are, but it also seems plausible that actually many of the cures he
thinks work magically well and should be widely distributed in fact
don’t work at all. And by “plausible” I mean “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_desensitization_and_reprocessing">that’s
what the scientific literature seems to show</a>”.</p>
<p>All that being said, the book contains a number of interesting
anecdotal observations about people in therapy, and I do intend to keep
it around to refer back to, it’s just that the process of referring back
to it will be so that I can do follow up literature searches to find
information from people who I like more and whose opinions I actually
trust.</p>
