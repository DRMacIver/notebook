<p>One of the big reasons I’m doing daily writing right now is that I
quit caffeine. I have a very entrenched belief that quitting caffeine
makes it harder for me to think, and my evidence for this is that my
writing habit evaporates every time I quit caffeine.</p>
<p>It is, as a factual matter, true that I stop writing when I quit
caffeine. That is a thing that happens. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-22-21:54.html">Writing
feels impossible</a>.</p>
<p>But there is, it turns out, a great technique for doing impossible
things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Try to do the thing and fail.</li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-25-20:16.html">Figure
out the actual specific thing that went wrong</a></li>
<li>Fix that.</li>
<li>Try again.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is my proposed default thing that goes wrong when you try to do
something that feels impossible: You think about doing the thing, you
are overcome with despair, you declare that it’s just impossible right
now, and then you flinch away from it and go do some dissociative
activity to self soothe from the aftermath of your terrible encounter
with the impossible.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Ask me how I know…</span></p>
<p>Part of why I’m big on <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html">necessity</a>
is that it is a fix for this problem. If not doing something you find
aversive is an option, not doing thing is likely to be the option you
pick. If you’re definitely going to do the thing, you’re able to have a
genuine encounter with it without much fuss.</p>
<p>It is, as a purely factual matter, not the case that it’s impossible
for me to write while not on caffeine. I write on WhatsApp or discord or
Twitter<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Well, not that one any more.</span> all the time when off caffeine. The
actual mechanical act of writing is not that hard for me, and I often
say perfectly interesting things.</p>
<p>I could absolutely just open up the notebook, paste a comment from
discord, and write here every day without thinking. I could flip to a
random page of a book and copy out some text on here. I could write “I
am a fish” 500 times.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I am tempted to just do this one day to stop this from
being a hypothetical that I use and make it a real live possibility.</span></p>
<p>This means that the only thing that is preventing me from writing
here every day is that I am <em>choosing not to</em>.</p>
<p>So, step one: Choose to. Put daily writing in the category of
necessity. This forces me to admit that it’s not actually impossible -
it’s not actually even terribly difficult - it is just mildly
uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This, in turn, creates encounters with the real problems that you’re
avoiding. Turns out, for me, I was struggling to find things that were
interesting for me to write about. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-26-19:06.html">It’s
not that I don’t know how to generate things to write about</a>, but
those don’t feel interesting either.</p>
<p>I think part of what’s happening here is that there are two major
relevant differences between my brain on caffeine and my brain off
caffeine:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>With caffeine, my threshold for something seeming interesting is
much lower.</li>
<li>With caffeine, my thoughts are buzzing all around and generating
many different overlapping ideas all the time.</li>
</ol>
<p>So when I’m caffeinated, sitting down to write is basically just a
matter of waiting for an idea to come along, grabbing it out of the air,
and pulling on it until the thread of an essay comes out. On the rare
occasions I’m stuck, I use a random prompt to lightly prime the process,
but really even with the random prompts it works in part because my
brain is extremely prone to going “AND THAT REMINDS ME OF FIVE OTHER
THINGS”.</p>
<p>When I’ve actually got something to write about, it’s not actually
that bad to write. It requires dealing with a degree of discomfort and
anxiety about the process, but it’s just a little bit slower and more
halting, it’s not actually a big deal it’s just mildly unpleasant.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is more true for notebook posts than for full
fledged essays that I actually have to think about because of how much
I’m just basically writing down my chain of thought reasoning here
rather than trying to make a clear well-articulated point.</span>. But sitting down and going “argh
fuck argh what do I write about?” is torture, partly because it’s
intrinsically unpleasant and partly because it triggers a whole “oh god
my brain is broken how can I live without caffeine? Woe is me, for I am
an abject wretch, deprived of that which gives my life meaning!”.</p>
<p>Anyway that sounds like a problem, David, have you tried solving
it?</p>
<p>Yes I have, and it turns out it’s extremely easily solved, and the
magic was inside me all along because I’ve solved this problem before.
<a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/using-a-list-to-manage-executive">The
solution is to make a list of things I could write about</a>. I’ve now
just got a little pad of paper on my desk with the heading “Things I
could write about”. When something comes to mind during the day that
seems interesting to write about, I jot down some slightly cryptic
phrase or sentence describing it, and when I come to write something I
look at what’s on the page. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-27-10:24.html">Censored
solutions</a> was the first post I wrote using this system (partly
because writing <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-26-19:06.html">Creativity
on demand</a> is what helped me spot it), and it’s been great since.
There are currenly 20 items on the list (including ones already
written).</p>
<p>The key thing that makes this work is that although it turns out that
I can’t currently generate ideas of what to write about at a rate that
means they just freely appear when I sit down to write, I sure generate
a lot of ideas in a day, the problem is that they don’t reliably stick
in my memory. As long as over the course of a day I generate more than
one idea to write about<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It looks like right now I generate about five. It’s
likely that that will go down over time, but not necessarily - writing
begets more writing, because it gives you new things to think about.</span>, the list will always be full.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I haven’t yet decided what to do when the list fills up.
I need to figure that out after finishing writing this post.</span></p>
<p>Anyway, the point I’m making is not this specific technique is great
(although it is), it’s that this specific technique was in fact <em>very
easy to create</em>, and I’ve tried and failed to write through caffeine
withdrawal multiple times before without creating it.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I have actually tried a daily writing habit while off
caffeine before and it didn’t stick, but the way it failed was that I
was having a terrible time for other reasons and went back on coffee
before I ran out of backlog of ideas of what to write about.</span>
Taking the option of not writing off the table and just making it my
problem to figure out how to do it any way forced me to figure out what
the real, specific, problem was, and do something about it rather than
just treating it as impossible.</p>
<p>Necessity creates possibility: If you <em>have</em> to do something,
probably you’ll figure out how.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Or, you know, fail horribly and die. But it’s hard to
fuck up a writing habit so hard you die.</span> If it’s optional, it’s
too easy to make excuses as to why you couldn’t possibly do it.
Frequently those excuses will feel very real and plausible, but
evaporate as soon as confronted with a firm insistence that you try.</p>
