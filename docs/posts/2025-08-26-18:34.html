<p>This post is inspired by a recent conversation with <a href="https://contemplatonist.substack.com/">Amber</a>.</p>
<p>I was explaining the idea of Type 2 Fun<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I hate the term, although it does at least have the
saving grace compared to many Type 1/2 distinctions that at least “Type
1” just means “the normal thing people mean by this word”.</span> -
things that are only fun in retrospect - and in reflection from the
conversation I think I’ve decided that the concept is stupid.</p>
<p>The problem is quite straightforward: It implicitly conflates “fun”
with “something you enjoyed and want to do again”, and those are
obviously different things. People enjoy all sorts of strong emotions
all the time, and it doesn’t have to be fun in order for them to do so.
Fun is a very specific emotional response, and is only one among many
that people enjoy. I couldn’t - and don’t want to - draw a specific
boundary around what is and isn’t fun, but I do think for example that
“fun” has a sort of lightheartedness, perhaps an element of
exhilaration, to it that is not present in most forms of enjoyment.</p>
<p>One of Amber’s examples was weight lifting. Weight lifting
<em>can</em> be fun, but you can also enjoy it in other ways - it can be
satisfying, it can be energising without being fun, it can calm you down
when you’re angry. There are loads of other positive effects.</p>
<p>A similar example for me is massage. Getting a massage is certainly
not fun.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I mean, ahem, depends on the type of massage. But the
type of massage I routinely get certainly isn’t.</span> A massage may or may not be pleasant
- there’s certainly a nice fluffy relaxing sort of massage you can get
that I’m sure some people enjoy a lot.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It mostly makes me grumpy.</span> At
the moment I’m very into traditional Thai massage, which is a sort of
pressure-massage-meets-assisted yoga. Quoth my most recent masseuse
“…why do you like this? Nobody picks this one. People normally come to
us for oil massage. Doesn’t it hurt?”. Yes, of course it hurts. The
trick is not to mind. And I do enjoy getting a very heavy massage - Thai
or otherwise. It hurts, but it in a very satisfying way.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is masochism, at least not exactly. It’s not the
fact that it hurts that I’m enjoying, but there’s a very no-pain-no-gain
feeling associated with it.</p>
<p>Another example is very frustrating games. I recently played (the
first two parts) of <a href="https://icely.itch.io/icwp-interactive">Increasingly Cursed
Wordle</a>. A huge part of the enjoyment of this game is the incredibly
angry noises you make when you figure out certain colours.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Purple/Green results in especially entertaining
diatribes.</span>
These are noises of genuine anger, or at least irritation, and that is
part and parcel of the experiences of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Playing Upwords with my dad is similar. I’ve got a running joke that
every game of Upwords is unusually bad. Honestly I’ve never seen such an
awful board. Ugh, why do we play this game? And then we play it
again.</p>
<p>In the moment none of these experiences are “fun”. They’re not fun in
retrospect either. But they are <em>satisfying</em>, and that is the
experience that we are trying to get out of them.</p>
<p>There are other ways to enjoy things than that too. For example,
people read incredibly depressing novels, or watch sad films. They may
end up sobbing at them! There might be some degree of satisfaction in
that, but if so it’s a very different sort than that you’ll get from
Increasingly Cursed Wordle or Upwords, which I think is different again
from the satisfaction you get from a massage.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I’m not sure about lifting weights. I think that’s
different again. Maybe a more similar example to lifting weights for me
is breath holding, which feels more like Slay the Spire or Upwords than
it does like a massage.</span>
It’s an experience of catharsis perhaps.</p>
<p>“Interest” is another one. I once read “Atomic Accidents: A History
of Nuclear Meltdowns”, and although I’m somewhat reluctant to use the
word “enjoy” for it, I think it’s the right word.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Except for the radium chapter, which left me wanting to
hide under my desk and cry.</span> The
book was horrifying and fascinating and I could not put it down.</p>
<p>I think this generalises, and there are very few emotional
experiences that people <em>don’t</em> enjoy in a safe environment. I
tried to come up with counterexamples - e.g. disgust seemed like an
obvious choice, but actually there are lots of ways people enjoy
disgust.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Only some of them sexual. e.g. a lot of people look at
things that gross them out. Although oddly I think in that case they
<em>are</em> having fun.</span> For example some people <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/delight-in-the-imperfect">love
sharing timezone facts</a>.</p>
