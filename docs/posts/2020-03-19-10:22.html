<p>I <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/02/you-should-be-stockpiling-food-for-brexit/">stockpiled food for Brexit</a>. A lot of people were skeptical of me for that, and many people have said that the way Brexit played out proved me wrong and that it was an overreaction.</p>
<p>They are wrong and I was right. Stockpiling food for Brexit and not needing it was the expected outcome. It was never something that I thought I was likely to need, it was a capacity I was building in case of a low probability high cost event. The logic was that either food stockpiling wouldn't be useful, in which case I had a surplus to use up, or it would be kinda useful in which case it was a net positive, or it would be essential, in which case I would be incredibly glad I had it.</p>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3926VQH">Annie Duke</a> calls this fallacy <em>resulting</em>, and I think it's a rare instance of something escaping <a href="https://maartenboudry.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-fallacy-fork-why-its-time-to-get.html">the fallacy fork</a>.
Resulting is the fallacy of assuming that because you got a bad outcome you must have made a bad choice, when in fact you might just have got a bad outcome because you picked the option with a 60% chance of success instead of a 40% chance but it turns out that you're in the 40% chance world. Chance means that you can never perfectly control the outcome, and you should be careful not to let random chance inform your learning too much.</p>
<p>More complicated is that often good strategies you'll never even know if you succeeded or not. A lot of mitigations for COVID-19 are like this: You'll never know whether it really mattered that you were washing your hands, or socially isolating, because all you're doing is stacking the odds on a numbers game. You might get the virus anyway, or you might have never got the virus, there's no way to know. It's still a good strategy.</p>
<p>Capacity building strategies in particular are often a good idea, because they can be useful in unexpected ways.
I didn't immediately dismantle my Brexit stockpile when it seemed unlikely that we'd need it, I've just been using it as a buffer, so now if we do end up on pandemic lockdown we'll be well placed for food supplies while self isolating.</p>
