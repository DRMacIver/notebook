<p>I mostly bought this book because of how much I love the following
passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word
sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to
what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it
drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now
listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The
writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short
sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I
am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of
considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with
all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the
cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see in this passage, Provost is very keen on writing in a
style that works well when spoken. Fortunately, this is the objectively
correct position, so that’s a point in his favour. In fact, this book
made me realise that <em>actually</em> reading out loud is very
different from reading in your head, so I’m going to try to do that more
often when writing.</p>
<p>This is one of the best passages in the book, but the rest of the
book is also very good, and contains a large number of useful tips. It’s
also very short.</p>
<p>In general the book is very prescriptivist, but it’s a <em>good</em>
kind of prescriptivism - one that makes it clear that prescriptive
suggestions are tools, not laws. He’s quick to point out the limitations
of the techniques he suggests, and that no rule is universal.</p>
<p>I also liked the following passage from the conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing is art, not science, and when I finish a piece of writing, I
do not review every single one of my tips. I ask, have I communicated
well? Have I pleased my readers, have I given them something that is a
joy to read? Have I entertained them, informed them, persuaded them, and
made my thoughts clear to them? Have I given them what they wanted?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this because it not only points out the limitations of the
rest of the book, but also stands alone as an excellent piece of advice
in its own right.</p>
<p>I don’t agree with everything Provost suggests, but nobody’s perfect.
For example he hates footnotes (and parentheses), which I love. The
material on research is also quite dated. Fortunately, because it’s a
tool box rather than a set of commandments, you are feel free to pick
and choose whichever of its tools work for you, and ignore the ones
which don’t.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to improve your writing, I recommend this book as a
useful and accessible way to do so.</p>
<p>On which note, I will leave you with the following quote from the
introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your writing does not improve after you have read this book, you
have not failed. I have. It is the writer’s job, not the reader’s, to
see that the writing accomplishes whatever goal the writer has set for
it.</p>
