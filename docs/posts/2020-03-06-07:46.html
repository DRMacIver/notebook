<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2IpgbDS">Experiences of Depression</a>
Matthew Ratcliffe does a great analysis of what it’s <em>like</em> to be
depressed. Key to his analysis is a distinction between
<em>intentional</em> feelings (“intentional” meaning “about something”
rather than “deliberate”. It’s a philosopher thing. I often use “about”
instead of “intentional”) and <em>existential</em> feelings, which are
more pervasive feelings that colour your existence rather than being
about one specific thing. You could think of these as feelings-about
(intentional feelings) and feelings-of (existential feelings) if that
helps.</p>
<p>Many of the feelings of depression are existential rather than
intentional, which is why it is so frustrating when people ask you what
you are depressed <em>about</em>. You’re not depressed about anything,
because the feelings that make up your depression are existential ones,
which lack aboutness.</p>
<p>One of the types of existential feelings that seems most central to
depression are ones concerning <em>restricted emotional range</em>. A
central example of this is hopelessness.</p>
<p>“Hope” is an intentional feeling. You hope <em>for</em> something.
Hope has an intrinsic aboutness to it. Hopelessness on the other hand,
is an existential one: It is more than merely a lack of hope, it is a
feeling that hope is impossible. You can lack any particular hope
without feeling hopeless.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to think of it as like being stuck. Feeling stuck
is more than just the absence of movement. You can be non-moving without
feeling stuck. Stuckness is the idea that movement is impossible.</p>
<p>In Minksy’s <a href="https://amzn.to/39wOsg8">The Emotion Machine</a>
he talks about emotions as ways of thinking, and how one of the various
systems that regulates our emotional experience are <em>critics</em>
which are designed to protectively limit our thoughts and actions based
on past experience. He suggests (p. 82) that there are at least three
types of critic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Corrector declares that you are doing something dangerous. “You
must stop right now, because you’re moving your hand toward aflame.”</p>
<p>A Suppressor interrupts before you begin the action you’re planning
to take. “Don’t start to move your hand toward that flame, lest it get
burned.”</p>
<p>A Censor acts yet earlier, to prevent that idea from occurring to you
- so you never even consider the option of moving your hand in that
direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(I don’t necessarily buy Minsky’s models in this book as 100% true,
but I find them useful metaphors)</p>
<p>I’d suggest that it is useful to think of hopelessness and similar as
the felt sense of a censor (a felt censor, so to speak). A censor is
active that is preventing certain emotions from activating, and you can
<em>feel</em> that that censor is there, and that feeling is an integral
feature of the depressive experience.</p>
