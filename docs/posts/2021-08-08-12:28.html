<p><a href="https://drossbucket.com/">Lucy</a> and I were talking about
the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-27-04:25.html">You
have to do the easy bits first</a> piece, and she asked me how I wrote
it.</p>
<p>It’s a good question. I didn’t answer it very well.</p>
<p>Here, let’s have another go.</p>
<p>The way to write like this is to write like this.</p>
<p>That isn’t a very helpful answer, huh.</p>
<p>One more time.</p>
<p>The way to write like THIS is to write like THIS!</p>
<p>the way to write</p>
<p>like this</p>
<p>is to write</p>
<p>like this</p>
<p>thewaytowritelikethisistowritelike this</p>
<p>You see?</p>
<p>The way to change how you write is to change how you write.</p>
<p>The best part of the answer I gave Lucy earlier is that the thing
where the paragraphs are short (I said one sentence, but actually
looking again they’re not) is more important than you’d think.</p>
<p>The way to change the voice you write in is to write in a different
voice.</p>
<p>And the voice of your writing is</p>
<p>determined by its form. As you shift</p>
<p>the layout</p>
<p>the format</p>
<p>the literal physical way the words appear on the page</p>
<p>the sound of what you are writing changes, and with it the voice in
which you write moves to match.</p>
<p>When I write like this, in long discursive paragraphs, in which I
patiently explain the thing I am doing to you, that is one voice. I can
fuck with it if I want, right? Code switch mid paragraph. I don’t have
to write like a tedious book, but this is the tone that I naturally fall
back into, because habits of writing are entrained ways of being, that
one grows comfortable in. If you try to do a thing that is well served
by a particular mode, you have to actively exert effort to avoid falling
back into that mode. It’s entirely possible, especially if you have
other modes that you’re used to and can borrow from, but without the
clarity that those modes provide, it is difficult to avoid. It is hard
to write differently without first deciding what that difference is, and
the easiest form of difference is to be able to say “More like
<em>that</em>”.</p>
<p>When you fuck with the form</p>
<p>you instantly break the habit</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>the habit can no longer serve you.</p>
<p>Will the result be good? Nah, probably not. That’s OK.</p>
<p><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/first/en122/lecturelist-2015-16-2/shklovsky.pdf">Viktor
Shklovsky thinks that art is about defamiliarisation</a>, and I think
this is even more true for the artist than for the viewer of the art. In
order to create art, you must first break out of your habitual mode of
engaging with the thing you are depicting. Anything that breaks the
habit by forcing you outside of what it can do will help you to achieve
that, by pushing you into a mode where everything is strange, and giving
you a space in which to learn that strangeness.</p>
<p>but if you do what you also do</p>
<p>you’ll get what you always get.</p>
<p>This is uncomfortable at first, of course it is. You’re learning a
whole new way of engaging with the world through writing. Stay with that
discomfort, and write through it, and see what happens.</p>
<p>Or, in short:</p>
<p>The way to write like this is to write like this.</p>
