<p>I’m not sure if it counts as a speedrun if you’ve already done the
book, but I thought I’d spend another hour on Intelligent Virtue today,
as I keep coming away from it thinking I haven’t really done it
justice.</p>
<p>I’m going to mix up the format of it a little bit by trying to do a
chapter-by-chapter breakdown in this hour.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>On page 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… the present distinctive account of virtue results from attending to
two ideas. One is that exercising a virtue involves practical reasoning
of a kind that can illuminatingly be compared to the kind of reasoning
we find in someone exercising a practical skill. Rather than asking at
the start how virtues relate to rules, principles, maximizing, or a
final end, we will gain by looking at the way in which the acquisition
and exercise of virtue can be seen to be in many ways like the
acquisition and exercise of more mundane activities, such as farming,
building, or playing the piano. The other idea is that virtue is part of
the agent’s happiness or flourishing, and that it is plausible to see
virtue as actually constituting (wholly or in part) that happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So roughly her point is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtues are developed like skills.</li>
<li>Virtues are a key part of “human flourishing”</li>
</ul>
<p>Oversimplifying, one can think of virtues as the skills of promoting
human flourishing, which is how I tend to characterise it (in large part
based on prior readings of this book).</p>
<p>The rest of the introduction mostly covers things that are going to
be covered in future chapters.</p>
<h3 id="virtue-character-and-disposition">Virtue, Character, and
Disposition</h3>
<p>This is the chapter in which she tries to explain what virtues are,
and very much falls prety to the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-02-09:29.html">People
are bad at defining things</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the places in this chapter where the phrase “virtue is” or
“virtues are” occur, with some surrounding context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A virtue is a lasting feature of a person, a tendency for the person
to be a certain way. It is not merely a lasting feature, however, one
that just sits there undisturbed. It is active: to have it is to be
disposed to act in certain ways</p>
<p>A virtue is not a static condition like [the tendency of glass to
shatter]; it is a disposition as a result of which Jane acts and thinks
in a certain way, and which is at any time strengthened by her generous
responses and weakened by failures to have them. If she is generous, her
generous actions and feelings both come from a virtue and fortify
it.</p>
<p>A virtue is also a reliable disposition. If Jane is generous, it is
no accident that she does the generous action and has generous
feelings.</p>
<p>Further, a virtue is a disposition which is is, the virtuous (or
vicious) person is acting in and from character when acting in a kindly,
brave or restrained way. This is another way of putting the point that a
virtue is a deep feature of the person. A virtue is a disposition which
is central to the person, to whom he or she is, a way we standardly
think of character.</p>
<p>… virtue is a disposition which is from the start an active and
developing one. It is not a passive product of a string of impacts from
outside; it is the way I (or you), an active creature, develops a
character through formation and education.</p>
<p>the virtues are educated developments of our unformed
motivations.</p>
<p>Since virtue is a disposition of the above kind, becoming virtuous
will naturally take time. Scrooge may have been converted suddenly to
compassion and kindliness on Christmas Eve, but the story is careful to
tell us that he continued over time the process of becoming a
compassionate person. Coming to see that being loyal or brave is a
worthwhile way to live is just the first step. Becoming virtuous
requires habituation and experience.</p>
<p>It is natural to worry at this point whether habituation is just
habit, and whether a virtuous disposition is just one built up by force
of habit. Our experience leads us, in a number of areas of our lives, to
develop habits which save time and effort. If developing a virtue is
like this, why should we think it amounts to anything more than habit
and even mere routine?</p>
<p>Virtue is unlike routine in a host of ways. [Followed by a long
discussion of why piano playing is not a virtue that I don’t entirely
understand]</p>
<p>Skilled dispositions are not static conditions; they are always
developing, being sustained or weakened. One of the major suggestions of
this book is that virtue is like practical skill in this respect (as
well as some others). Because a virtue is a disposition it requires
time, experience, and habituation to develop it, but the result is not
routine but the kind of actively and intelligently engaged practical
mastery that we find in practical experts such as pianists and
athletes.</p>
<p>A central feature of routine is that the reaction to the relevant
situation is always the same, which is why routine can be depended on
and predicted. But practical skill and virtue require more than
predictably similar reaction; they require a response which is
appropriate to the situation instead of merely being the same as that
produced in response to other situations. This appropriateness comes
from the habituated disposition that a virtue is. As Aristotle says: ’It
… seems to be characteristic of the more courageous person to be
unafraid and unruffled in sudden alarms rather than to be so in those
that are foreseen; it comes more from his state of character [hexis,
often translated ‘disposition’], because less from preparation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this produces a set of <em>necessary</em> conditions for
something to count as a virtue. It must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>a characteristic disposition of the person to act in a particular
way (generously, courageously).</li>
<li>in some way <em>fundamental</em> to the person exercising it - that
is, if you were to somehow take away the virtue they would have to be a
very different person.</li>
<li>oriented towards something that we desire in and of itself (our
“unformed motivations”)</li>
<li>consciously and knowingly practiced, leading to its further
development.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this cannot count as sufficient to be a virtue because many
vices could also satisfy this condition e.g. “nastiness” or “hedonistic
debauchery” also satisfy this for people who are motivated towards such
things, but it’s a good start for at least distinguishing virtues from
other skills.</p>
<h3 id="skilled-and-virtuous-action">Skilled and virtuous action</h3>
<p>In this she is trying to further distinguish virtues from skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some practical skills do seem to involve mere routine - this is true
of daily activities such as getting to work which we are sometimes
prepared to call skills, though at other times we call them routines or
rituals. (…) We find the important similarity of virtue to skill in
skills where two things are united: the <em>need to learn</em> and the
<em>drive to aspire</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the “skill analogy” is highlighting the idea that virtues are
things where excellence must be sought and is something we should desire
in and of itself.</p>
<p>She goes on to say (some pages later after a bunch of detailed
intermediate discussion)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtue can most illuminatingly be seen as like this kind of skill; it
shares the intellectual structure of a skill where we find not only the
need to learn but the drive to aspire, and hence the need to ’give an
account, the need for articulate conveying of reasons why what is done
is done. The learner in virtue, like the learner in a practical skill,
needs to understand what she is doing, to achieve the ability to do it
for herself, and to do it in a way that improves as she meets
challenges, rather than coming out with predictable repetition. This
conies about when the virtue is conveyed by the giving and receiving of
reasons, in contrast with the non-rational picking up of a knack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This view does rather explain why she thinks people with Downs
syndrome can’t be virtuous, but suggests that perhaps one way of
thinking about virtue ethics is that it’s not actually intended to be
universally normative. That is, it’s entirely possible to be fully
ethical without being virtuous. You can imagine (although I suspect no
such person exists) someone who always unthinkingly does the right thing
out of a natural pleasantness of character, and never strives for it.
Such a person is ethical but not virtuous.</p>
<p>In this light, I think perhaps a good way to read Annas (and
ethicists in general?) is as a sort of “Ethics for Nerds” - if you don’t
automatically know the right thing to do, how would you go about
learning to do so?</p>
<p>Perhaps the way to think of the virtues is as a sufficient but not
necessary set of conditions for being a good person.</p>
<h3 id="the-scope-of-virtue">The Scope of Virtue</h3>
<p>In this she starts by defending virtue against the critique of
relativism, but I am in fact completely comfortable with relativism and
think her defence is probably wrong.</p>
<p>In it she mentions <a href="https://www.virtuesproject.com/">The
Virtues Project</a> as an example of an attempt at a cross-cultural list
of the virtues. This sounds interesting and I may spend more time with
it, but also I did a card pick on it and it lead me to the <a href="https://virtuesdev.com/vpicks/Prayerfulness.png">Prayerfulness</a>
virtue at which point I said “Oh fuck you” out loud and closed the site
for now.</p>
<p>The chapter does contain the following interesting passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Aristotle says in the passage I have quoted more than once,
everyone seeks the good, not just what their parents did. Becoming
virtuous starts the process by making it clear that the virtuous life
cannot just be the life your parents lead. Anyone can come to realize
this, and anyone can continue the progressive enlargement of
understanding.</p>
<p>Why then do so few do so? This is not a problem particular to
thinking in terms of virtue, since any ethical theory has to face the
fact that most people do not live by it. The answer given by the present
account is that while we are all capable of aspiring to become virtuous,
most of us resist being pulled away from our familiar original contexts
by becoming progressively more virtuous. Rather than deal with the fact
that our family is dishonest, our country jingoistic, the values we have
learnt inadequate, we make rationalizations, or simply refuse to face
facts. We are unwilling to criticize the contexts and institutions
within which we learned the virtues, because we are unwilling to be
pulled away from those contexts in the way that would be required. The
community of the family, or society, is a visible and tangible one,
providing real comfort and support. The community of the honest (the
brave, the open-minded, and so on) is an invisible one composed of all
those who, past, present, and future, act, reason, and feel in certain
ways; accessible only through thought and reflection, it offers less
help in getting through the day.’ If we think of community as a form of
solidarity, pre-existing solidarities can make it hard to be detached
from them.’ To identify with the community of the just, rather than with
your own fellow citizens, is often hard, for it requires detachment from
the existing support you get from relations with your fellow-citizens.
What requires explanation, then, is not so much the slackness of most
people in developing the virtues, but the strength of the few in
achieving them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong vibes of what I’ve written about in the past in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html">The
social obligation to be bad at things</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-31-09:20.html">Norms
of Excellence</a>.</p>
<p>I think what she is essentially arguing in this chapter is that
culture can <em>limit</em> our virtue, but that there is a single
overarching but imperfectly expressed universal notion of virtue, which
striving to be vituous allows us to move our communities towards.</p>
<p>To which I say: Well, maybe.</p>
<h3 id="virtue-and-enjoyment">Virtue and Enjoyment</h3>
<p>In this chapter she is arguing that one of the key features of virtue
is that the virtuous like being virtuous. They don’t experience it as a
chore, but as a thing that is worthwhile in and of itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, one aspect of the virtuous person’s moral psychology,
perhaps surprisingly, points us to another important analogy between
skill and virtue. Aristotle famously comments that the virtuous person
is distinguished by finding what he does pleasant: ’We must take as an
indication of a person’s states the pleasure or pain consequent on what
he does, because the person who abstains from bodily pleasures and finds
his enjoyment in doing just this is temperate, while the person who
finds doing it oppressive is intemperate; and the person who enjoys
facing up to danger, or at least does not find it painful to do so, is
courageous, while he who does find it painful is a coward. The
temperance example is not hard to understand. Someone resolving to give
up meat, for example, will at first have to fight against temptation and
will find the forbidden food attractive; but as they develop the
relevant disposition to be vegetarian they cease to find it tempting.
Eventually they take more pleasure in not eating what they now reject
than they did when they ate it; the vegetarian finds it more enjoyable
to be a vegetarian than she did being someone who enjoyed eating
meat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly this sounds to me like the sort of thing you tell people
even if it’s false. My personal experience of being vegetarian (which
may not be representative of “true virtue” in that I did eventually
decide not to be) is that while I found the idea of eating meat actively
unappealing, I never <em>enjoyed</em> not eating meat. I enjoyed what I
was eating, and I didn’t want to eat meat, but there was never any sense
that vegetarianism in and of itself was enjoyable, it was just a thing,
and I expect this is normal. I think this is just a weak example though
- I can certainly see the argument that some exercises of virtue are
enjoyable, I just don’t think vegetarianism works like this.</p>
<p>Much of the rest of the chapter is connecting up virtue with the idea
of <em>flow</em>, and that virtue is enjoyable because it creates flow.
This seems too cute to me, but I think the core idea that virtue is
enjoyable because it is a skilled practice and using your skills in
worthwhile ways is enjoyable is reasonably solid.</p>
<h3 id="virtues-and-the-unity-of-the-virtue">Virtues and the unity of
the virtue</h3>
<p>I’m running out of time and feel like <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-06-00:02.html">I
covered this adequately yesterday</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we say anything more specific about the distinctive kind of
admiration called forth by virtue?</p>
<p>The first answer is that in the case of the virtues our admiration is
for the person’s character: possession of virtues indicates something
about what the person is like, whereas possession of traits such as
tidiness or wittiness indicates only traits that the person has. Take
someone who is characteristically tidy, who, noticing that his car has
got messy, cleans it out. What does this tell us about his character?
Very little. Let us suppose that the same person is characteristically
brave, and that in the course of the subsequent drive he stops and
courageously rescues passengers trapped in a crashed and burning car.
This action, unlike the previous one, does indicate what kind of person
he is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly I think tidiness tells you a lot about the sort of person
someone is, and could legitimately get behind the idea that cleanliness
is a virtue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We might think at this point that the contrast here is not between
virtues and other traits, but between virtues and vices on the one hand
and other traits on the other. For surely, we think, vices indicate
character as much as virtues do? This is true up to a point, and shows
that virtues do more than merely indicate character. Suppose another
person who sees the burning car, but pretends not to, and drives on.
This is a cowardly act, and if it is characteristic of the person it
does tell us something about him as a person, namely that he is a
coward. But there is an important difference here, which can be brought
out by the claim that the brave person is, by virtue of being brave,
expressing a commitment to goodness, a commitment to positive value.
Although this is a very general point, it is intuitive. The brave
person’s action reveals that he is committed to something valuable that
is centrally important to him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, I think, where the idea of unity of the virtues comes from:
The central feature of virtue is “commitment to goodness”.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h3>
<p>I ran out of time at this point, without having finished covering the
last few chapters, and I think this demonstrates the weakness of the
format - Intelligent Virtue isn’t even a very long book!</p>
<p>I think I’m going to rebrand these from “speedruns” to “studies”,
because it’s clear that I can’t do justice to a book in an hour (this is
of course not surprising, although bear in mind these are also books
I’ve already read), and I may well do a further study on the last couple
of chapters of this book because they seem quite important.</p>
