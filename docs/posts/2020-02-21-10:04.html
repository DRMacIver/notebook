do hard things</a></li>

mathematics makes you better at programming (and so does everything
else)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Have you noticed how when you first start learning a skill, you
rapidly get better at it? Then, after a while of that rapid growth, you
start to plateau. You’ve seemingly picked all the low hanging fruit and
are no longer improving. Why is that?</p>
<p>Well there probably isn’t any one reason, and some of it is
legitimately the low hanging fruit problem - some ways of getting better
at a skill are easier than others, and once you’ve done all of those
things you’re left with the hard ones - but I’d like to suggest one
reason that I think is underappreciated. It’s because you’ve hit a
<em>constraint</em>, and the skill you are practicing does not give you
a good feedback loop for improving on that constraint.</p>
<p>The theory of constraints is a management philosophy thing. It is the
very obvious common sense idea (which is to say that it’s an idea that
in the moment people find completely nonobvious and never think of): If
something isn’t where the bottleneck is, it doesn’t matter how much
better you make it. e.g.~it doesn’t matter if you improve your widget
production if the distribution system can’t keep up with the new number
of widgets.</p>
<p>This is true for skills too and ties in to a problem I talked about
in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-19-10:37.html">Books
by writers are the worst</a>. If the quality of your written works is
bottlenecked on communication skills, it doesn’t matter how much you
improve your writing skills your books are just not going to get much
better.</p>
<p>Skills are generally improved by tight feedback loops, and often
simply using the skill to achieve your goals is not a very tight
feedback loop for the particular aspect of it you are constrained on,
because there’s so much else going on that it makes the feedback loop
very slow.</p>
<p>To continue the writing example, say you want to improve your
communication skills. You <em>could</em> write more books in order to
practice that, but writing a book takes a very long time. You don’t
necessarily have that many books in you. You could instead practice
these skills by writing essays, or even by having conversations with
people on Twitter or in person.</p>
<p>This is the point I made in “why mathematics makes you better at
programming”: Different subjects and tasks give different feedback loops
on different aspects of skill, so often the best way to get good at a
skill is to practice a different but related skill.</p>
<p>Additionally, sometimes constraints are hidden from you. Often the
constraint on a skill is anxiety management, or discomfort tolerance, or
one of various other things that you don’t even really think of as
skills you can get better at. Sometimes the best way to unconstrain
yourself are to go and do something <em>completely</em> different which
force you to confront that.</p>
