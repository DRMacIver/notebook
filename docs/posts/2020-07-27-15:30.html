<p>As per <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-26-10:40.html">notes
on reduced output</a> I’m trying to do more book post prompts. Right now
I think this will be <em>very</em> rough and ready stuff where I’m just
gathering together some related thoughts.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2LZNHSF">Behind Human Error</a> by
Woods et al., page 173:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>flexibility tends to create and proliferate modes of operation which
create new cognitive demands on practitioners. Practitioners must know
more - both about how the system works in each different mode and about
how to manage the new set of options in different operational
contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long ago I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-10-31-16:54.html">The No
Genies Conjecture</a>, in which I proposed that all systems have at most
two of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
</ul>
<p>This prompted a good conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisamaphone/status/1252591089900572673">Chris
Martens</a> about what “easy to use” meant, in that most experts
presumably find their tools easy to use. I think this is a good example
of why that is not the case: As flexibility goes up, the amount of state
that the expert has to manage in their head will usually exceed the
capacity of their week fleshy game.</p>
<p>This is also the limitation of what I suggested in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-10-16:52.html">learning
to use the system</a>, where I talked about how forming mental models is
critical to using a system effectively. In response to this pozorvlak
pointed out how one of the features of good UI is to enable the
formation of mental models.</p>
<p>In particular I thought <a href="https://twitter.com/pozorvlak/status/1282994011440021505">this
point was particularly good</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>good UIs foster a good mental model of the system, <em>split over the
mind of the user and the information available in the world</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that this split is rarely well facilitated, especially
in systems designed for experts, and this gets only worse as the
flexibility of the system grows.</p>
<p>One of the big problems that comes up a lot in “Behind Human Error”
is the problem of <em>modality</em>. Modal systems are ones where you
need different mental models for different states of the system. People
commit mode errors when they use a mental model for a different
mode.</p>
<p>This, I think, points to one of the difficulties of externalising
parts of your mental model: what you’re externalising it as is, itself,
something you need a model for.</p>
<p>I don’t know what to do about this, but evidence suggests neither do
the people who work on such systems unfortunately.</p>
