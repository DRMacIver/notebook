<h1 id="a-guide-to-starting-a-daily-writing-practice">A Guide to
Starting a Daily Writing Practice</h1>
<p>Apparently I’m now <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265999121057546242">that guy
who gets people to start daily writing practices</a>, so here’s a daily
writing about daily writing practices.</p>
<h3 id="the-short-version">The short version</h3>
<p>The daily writing practice I’d advocate for is to write at least one
sentence, as close to every day as you can manage, in a location that
gives you the opportunity to easily write something closer to a short
essay should you choose to do so. Ideally this would be in public, under
a pseudonym if you prefer, but if you can’t bring yourself to do that
it’s also find to write <em>as if</em> it were intended for other people
to read but to do it somewhere in private.</p>
<p>The rest of this post will be some guidance on how to make this work
for you.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-the-practice">What is the purpose of the
practice?</h3>
<p>The purpose of the practice is to write every day and enjoy doing so.
That’s it.</p>
<p>There are some <em>additional benefits</em> of the practice, but the
practice is in and of itself supposed to be an enjoyable thing which
puts something out into the world that would otherwise not be there.</p>
<p>Additional benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will improve your writing skills, and your communication skills
in general, by giving you a place to practice writing.</li>
<li>It will help resolve writing anxiety. You are probably much better
at writing than you think you are, but writing feels hard not because
writing <em>is</em> hard but because you have a lot of associated
anxiety with it (school does that to you). By getting to regularly
experience writing as relatively easy, you’ll start to drain some of
that anxiety.</li>
<li>You will likely find you have a lot of thoughts that were not
getting expressed, and a daily writing practice gives you somewhere to
express them.</li>
<li>Daily writing is a good place to think. It doesn’t <em>force</em>
you to think deeply, but it gives you a place where you can develop your
skills for deep thought should you choose to do so. You will almost
certainly become a better thinker through a daily writing practice.</li>
<li>By writing daily you’ll start to notice themes across your writing,
and you can begin to draw them out, connecting up your knowledge and
thouhts better.</li>
<li>If you share it, people will find your writing useful. They probably
won’t find <em>all</em> your writing useful - the point of a daily
practice is that you get to write stuff that’s not very good, and that’s
fine - but I’m sorry to inform you that if you write every day over a
sustained period of time (months, certainly, but probably even within
your first week) you’re doomed to write something that people actually
like.
<ul>
<li>This is good for them, obviously.</li>
<li>It’s also good for you. People will say nice things about you. You
will like that.</li>
<li>It may also spark interesting conversations.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="success-criteria">Success criteria</h3>
<p>Success is writing one sentence, almost every day, and feeling
neutral to positive about having done so.</p>
<p>Most days you will probably find yourself writing more than one
sentence. If you only ever write one sentence you should probably try to
write more some days, but I find writing more tends to come naturally
for people and writing only a sentence every day is probably a sign that
you’re not enjoying the practice rather than a problem in and of itself,
so I wouldn’t worry about length too much. Success on any given day is
just the one sentence.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even have to be a good sentence. Success in your daily
writing practice does not require any quality. If you’re putting it in
public somewhere you can explicitly signal that it is <em>practice</em>
- a lot of us are using blogs like this one labelled “notebook” to
indicate that the writing is just some thoughts that we’re writing down.
You can write high quality stuff if you want to from time to time, but
it’s not required for success.</p>
<p>You probably won’t write literally every day. Missing a day is fine.
If you’re missing a lot of days (more than about one a week on any sort
of recurring basis, say) then something is up and you should figure out
what that is and what to do about it. Don’t beat yourself up about it -
it means something about the practice isn’t working for you, and you
should treat figuring that out as a practical problem to solve. Chances
are you’re setting too high a bar for yourself.</p>
<p>You shouldn’t hate your practice. If you hate your practice, you’re
probably either setting your standards too high, or you’re uncovering
some uncomfortable feelings around writing that it might be worth
examining (may I recommend <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-03-09:56.html">some
useful emotion management principles</a>?). If it’s the latter, remind
yourself that this practice is successful if and only if you hit this
incredibly low bar, and that it’s a good practice to do, and that you
can set aside your normal standards for writing while doing it.</p>
<h3 id="failure-criteria">Failure criteria</h3>
<p>I want to be very clear on this: It is OK to try a writing practice
and give it up. Beginning a daily writing practice does not oblige you
to continue a daily writing practice.</p>
<p>My recommendation would be that if after a month you have not been
able to make it work for you in the sense above - i.e. writing almost
every day and enjoying it - then you should quit. Additionally,
throughout that month you should be actively looking at any problems you
run into and trying to solve them. If you get properly stuck feel free
to ask me for advice.</p>
<p>The month is just an arbitrary deadline. If prior to that point you
decide that the writing practice is making you miserable, and you cannot
figure out how to solve that, quit earlier obviously. I’d recommend
perseverance if it’s at worstnot quite working for you, but I’d also
recommend trying to figure out why it’s not working for you and seeing
if you can fix that.</p>
<h3 id="prompts">Prompts</h3>
<p>One of the most important things to maintaining a daily writing
practice is that there should never be any uncertainty if you
<em>can</em> do the writing today, and the key to that is to have a good
set of prompts for writing.</p>
<p>My favourite prompt is to find some interesting passage of writing,
copy it out, and add commentary. The commentary can be any sort of
thought prompted by it, or if you’re stuck for what to say you can just
explain what the passage is about, provide context, etc.</p>
<p>This passage can come from anywhere - something you’ve read recently,
a tweet you’ve seen, a conversation you’ve had, but my personal
favourite procedure is to use random pages from books. This goes like
this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pick a book, ideally one that you’ve read. I prefer using physical
books for this, but it’s doable with ebooks. I randomize the book
selection but it might be helpful to set aside a favourite novel for
this as the default if you don’t have anything you want to use on a
given day.</li>
<li>Pick a random page within that book, either by flicking through it
or using a random number generator such as <a href="https://www.random.org/">random.org</a>.</li>
<li>Find an interesting passage on that page and use that (possibly
continuing on to the next page, or scanning back to the previous one for
the start of a passage). If nothing catches your eye, pick another page.
If still nothing catches your eye, pick another book.</li>
</ol>
<p>I find this is a <em>very</em> reliable prompt for being able to
write something even when I’m not feeling it.</p>
<p>Another prompt that I’ve been enjoying reading but haven’t tried
myself is that Lisa has been doing <a href="https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/series/drabble/">drabbles</a> -
picking a topic in philosophy (you can pick your own area, Lisa is a
philosopher) and writing 100 word explanations of that topic.</p>
<p>Another useful thing is to keep a file of things that you could write
about at some point and if you’re stuck on any given day, scroll through
that file and see if any of them catch your eye. I’ve not been using
this much recently since I started using the book prompt as my default,
but it’s been very helpful in the past and if the book idea doesn’t work
for you then try this.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-should-it-take">How long should it take</h3>
<p>You should tailor your writing to how long you have. If you don’t
have long, the prompts are important.</p>
<p>For me I rarely spend less than 15 minutes on it, and even more
rarely spend more than an hour on it (this post is unusually long to
write because I’m trying to explain something specific rather than just
rambling on a prompt, so it might take almost an hour to write).</p>
<p>Key to this is the low quality aspect. Daily writing involves almost
minimal editing. If you want an editing practice, that’s separate.</p>
<h3 id="things-to-watch-out-for">Things to watch out for</h3>
<p>The notebook blog is supposed to be an enjoyable thing that you can
keep up indefinitely. It can stop being this long before it “fails” and
in order to avoid it, it’s worth watching out for some things:</p>
<ul>
<li>taking too long over posts.</li>
<li>starting to put off writing posts, or not wanting to write
them.</li>
<li>doing a lot of editing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to have this is by writing too many good posts! It’s
very easy to let your standards creep too high, and you won’t be able to
sustain that indefinitely. It’s good to write good posts from time to
time, but you’re not going to be able to do it every day.</p>
<p>My recommendation is that to counteract this you should deliberately
half-arse your posts at least a couple days per week. Pick a prompt and
do the bare minimum amount of work needed to fulfill it.</p>
<h3 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h3>
<p>You should avoid any nontrivial activation energy for getting started
and just start. Pick wherever to write is the lowest effort for you to
do so, don’t try to do anything complicated to get set up.</p>
<p>Social media is not generally a good choice for this. Twitter, or
Facebook, are not very good for the essay format, and I do think it is
important to write somewhere where you could write longer posts if you
wanted to.</p>
<p>My ideal recommendation is to start a blog or a newsletter somewhere.
I’ve been enjoying Substack for <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/">my newsletter</a>. If you’re at
all programmery doing a static site on GitHub pages is also a good way
to go, otherwise <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> is a
good option. <a href="https://reading.supply/">reading.supply</a> seems
nice but I haven’t used it (and it’s currently difficult to subscribe to
if you’ve not got an account there, but that may be a feature depending
on how shy you’re feeling).</p>
<p>Also, you should get started now. Step away from this post, set up a
place to write, and then write something.</p>
