<p>This a lovely book that I can’t really easily summarise. It’s a
melancholy exploration of our relationship to the world, through the
lens of loss and what it means to be lost.</p>
<p>One thing that was interesting for me personally when reading it is
how very clearly it is the sort of book which I could never possibly
have written. I don’t just mean that the author is a much better writer
than me (although she absolutely is), but the nature of our
relationships with memory are very different: The book is full of
detail-rich memory of her life, with the themes she’s discussing being
woven in and out and illustrated with personal stories and how they
played out in those cases.</p>
<p>I simply don’t have that sort of memory, which makes it very hard for
me to… relate is not the right word, because I can absolutely relate,
but I cannot imagine what it would be like to have that level of access
to my history. Usually this just feels normal, but being confronted with
how wide that gap is is a strange (and, indeed, lost) feeling.</p>
