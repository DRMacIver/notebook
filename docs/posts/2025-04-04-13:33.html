<p>I recently watched CJTheX’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZg_36utl2w">6 Shapes of God</a>.
I don’t really know if I recommend it or not. I recommend giving it a go
and either you’ll find it weirdly compelling and watch it or you won’t
want to watch it and both are fine outcomes.</p>
<p>One of the things they talk about in it, partially rooted in some
work by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt that I’m passingly familiar
with<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And really should read more of. I find Frankfurt a bit
dry, but generally he makes really interesting points about stuff I care
about.</span> is that there’s a sort of division
into “instrumental ends” (e.g. I want to make money) and “terminal ends”
(I want to have fun) that is natural to make, and also is sortof fake,
because we also take on our “terminal ends” for instrumental reasons: If
we didn’t have something to strive for, we’d be bored.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I think I might here be conflating Harry Frankfurt’s
views with Elijah Millgram’s “On being bored out of your mind”, but in
my defence that paper is specifically building on Frankfurt’s work
here.</span></p>
<p>Frankfurt<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I think.</span> introduces the idea of “maeutic”
ends - ends which lead to you taking on other ends in order to achieve
them. e.g. you might want to be happy, but merely aiming directly at
happiness doesn’t work. In order to achieve happiness, the most
effective means is to find something that can matter to you for its own
sake, and then <em>sincerely take that on as an end</em>, and happiness
will emerge. e.g. when deciding what to do with your life, you might
decide to be a doctor because that seems fulfilling to you, but you
can’t be a doctor to seek fulfillment and expect to be fulfilled, you
need to decide that being a doctor genuinely matters. You might later
decide that it is not if it’s making you miserable and lacks the
qualities that matter to you, but in the moment your day-to-day reason
has to be about the end of <em>being a doctor</em>, not <em>being a
doctor in order to be fulfilled</em>.</p>
<p>The instrumental/terminal distinction is still useful though, it’s
just important to understand that “why?” answers are weird and
defeasible and necessarily incomplete.</p>
<p>Why did you eat that cake? Because it was delicious.</p>
<p>If you look at this as a sort of pure logical syllogism sort of
answer</p>
