<p>So, Dave and I went to Cambridge recently to visit Dani Clode at the
neuroplasticity lab. She developed a device called <a href="https://www.daniclodedesign.com/thethirdthumb">the third
thumb</a>, which is pretty much what it sounds like - it’s an extra
thumb you can attach to your hand on the opposite side of your normal
thumb.</p>
<figure>
<img alt="Pictured, me with a third thumb." src="/images/third-thumb.png"/>
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Pictured, me with a third
thumb.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It’s designed specifically as an augmentation, not a prosthesis,
which I thought was an interesting choice. The difference is essentially
that it’s not designed to exactly mimic a biological thumb, but instead
has a couple of adjustments that are there to help you use it in ways
that you wouldn’t normally use a thumb. e.g. they’ve got an example of
essentially wrapping the thumb around a bottle while you twist the cap
on and off with your hand.</p>
<p>One of the things that was interesting about it was that it was just
very hard to use.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">For me. Dave found it very natural</span> I was starting to get the hang of it
by the end, but I was just constantly dropping things or holding them in
weird ways that didn’t make much sense and often didn’t even actually
use the third thumb. Some of that is just that it’s foot controlled,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">You get two degrees of freedom. One with your left foot
to move the thumb up and down, and one with your right foot which you
use to grip.</span> vnd I don’t have very good foot
control, but I think a lot of it’s just that it is genuinely quite
unintuitive. Dani told us that they’ve got a week-long training course
that they run with these to show people how to use them, and people
usually have the hang of it by the end of the week.</p>
<p>And I thought that was pretty interesting in its own right, because
it’s fairly rare that I encounter a new sort of device that requires
this much training to use. Implicitly, you do have that much training in
how to use a keyboard or how to use a mouse but particularly with the
keyboard example, there’s an easy onboarding route, you can always hunt
and peck, right? It’s not that you need a huge amount of training in
order to be able to use the keyboard at all. It’s that there is a
fluency that you acquire through time and practice, but the baseline
level of disfluency is still pretty effective.</p>
<p>The third thumb wasn’t like that at all. I was making a complete mess
of things, as early on there is no equivalent to hunt and peck, and my
ability to do things was made strictly worse by using the third thumb.
You have to just have to figure out how to use it before it’s anything
other than in the way. Now, we were not encountering it in the proper
training setting, so this is very much not me saying that the third
thumb is not a usable object, I’m saying that there is an effort
required to onboard to using it it, and this is just an interesting
contrast with most of the devices that we encounter.</p>
<p>Dave and Lisa are currently learning to drive, which seems in some
ways like a good analogy to that, in that there isn’t an easy onboard to
learning to drive. But honestly this is partly because there is a high
safety requirement, and partly because you need to not just know how to
use the car you need to know how to use it in a way that is predictable
to others. You could learn to drive by just messing around in a car and
seeing how that works. There’s nothing that in theory stops you from
doing this, and presumably many early car users did learn to drive this
way - formal licensing of drivers is a much more modern form than the
car itself - but regardless of how artificial the gap is there’s still
this sort of onboarding requirement.</p>
<p>In contrast, the most transformative technology I can think of that’s
happened to me in recent years is still the smartphone.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I know that’s not that recent anymore but I can’t think
of anything as big since. AI isn’t there yet.</span>
Certainly this is probably the biggest example of augmentation in our
day-to-day lives. But the smartphone is very much not like a third thumb
or a car. It is designed with continuity to the mobile phone from
before, which is designed for continuity with previous devices, and it’s
designed to be easy for kids to pick up,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Too easy if anything.</span> and
is generally a fairly gentle onboarding process. Although your use of it
will improve with practice, you don’t really have to spend a whole bunch
of time sitting down with your smartphone and trying to figure out how
to use it before it’s useful, instead it starts useful and becomes more
useful over time.</p>
<p>And it seems to me like there’s this split of how much effort you
have to invest in before you know how to use a particular type of
technology. It’s not exactly shallow vs steep learning curves, so much
as it’s about time to first usefulness. There can be a lot of depth to
learning a new technology, but if it’s rewarding from early on then it
will be a very different experience from something with a high up front
cost, and I feel like we’ve gotten very used to the idea that everything
should be more like the smartphone than the third thumb.</p>
<p>This does on some level make sense of course. In some sense it’s
clearly better to have this than not, right? It’s much more rewarding to
immediately be able to use a thing and work from there to improve it
than it is to have to invest a whole bunch of effort into something that
isn’t useful until you spend that effort.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">In that it turns learning it into an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-12-16:30.html">anytime
project</a></span>,
but it seems like there’s limitations to that approach where not all
things <em>can</em> work like that, and that up front investment feels
extremely daunting and unwelcome.</p>
<p>Part of why I care about this is that one of the things I like about
the third thumb is that I do have a pervasive sense that the world
should be weirder than it is. I think this is partly just my “where’s my
flying car” instinct. I do have a sort of very science fiction type
attachment to the idea that you can expand human capabilities, and feel
like it’s a shame that we’ve largely not gone down that route and
instead just embraced phones as a shitty ad-supported version of our
cyborg future.</p>
<p>I don’t know how you would ever make physical augmentation useful
from day one, because it’s such a fundamental change to your way of
being in the world. In sensory augmentation, maybe, something like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229152043/http://sensebridge.net/projects/northpaw/order/">the
North Paw</a> is a good example. Because it’s just providing you
feedback. You can consciously interpret that feedback and gradually you
internalize it over time. But something like the third thumb or
prehensile tail, I don’t know how well you can possibly make that an
incremental approach, and as a result this attachment to easy learning
experiences feels like a limitation on human progress.</p>
<p>I’ve often thought that there just is a lot of sort of missing space
in the range of UIs that we try out. And some of that is many of the
alternatives we tried out just aren’t very good. You can sort of see
this with VR where it turns into, like, turned out to be like a quite
limited paradigm that we still haven’t figured out how to use well. But
I was really interested in the idea of using the Kinect or Leap Motion
as styles of interaction with a computer and doesn’t seem to have turned
out that way, and I don’t think that was just the limitations of the
technology, I think it was the degree to which it required both the
users and the developers to actually learn something new.</p>
<p>And I think these sorts of cliffs where you have to do active
training are part of that. I think people have gotten as used to the
idea that UI should be seamless and intuitive as they are used to the
idea that websites should be free and that seems like a shame.</p>
<p>Another problem with this is that even things where you don’t have to
invest this sort of trained skill practice into, I bet we would actually
benefit from deliberate practice. I bet actually, if I spent a week
studying how to better use my smartphone and better fit it into my life,
I probably would figure out important and interesting things about how
to use it.</p>
<p>I think something I notice is that there is a general lack of
deliberate practice for our everyday tools and habits built into life,
and it seems like we are missing something as a result.</p>
