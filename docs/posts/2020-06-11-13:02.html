<h1 id="losing-the-story-for-the-style">Losing the story for the
style</h1>
<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2LYdFGs">100 Ways to Improve your
Writing</a> by Gary Provost, page 57:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no subject that cannot be made fascinating by a
well-informed and competent writer. And there is no subject that cannot
be quickly turned into a literary sleeping pill by an incompetent
writer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This is as part of a section on style)</p>
<p>This isn’t true, and the fact that Provost thinks it’s true is
heavily informed by sorts of things he writes about, which tend to be of
more general interest.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that fascination is a question of
audience/writing fit. In a similar way that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-08-08:53.html">you
can’t teach everything to a layperson</a>, you cannot fascinate someone
who refuses to be fascinated, and some people are just never going to be
fascinated by some subjects, and you may well need to write about those
subjects (possibly because of the people who <em>are</em> going to be
fascinated by it!).</p>
<p>It’s true that there is a fascinating story to be told about most
subjects for most people, but often you shouldn’t tell that one because
it’s not the important bit. This reminds me of Zinsser’s fucking
terrible advice to tell a story about your engagement with the subject
matter rather than the subject matter itself. There are circumstances
under which that is the right thing to do, but those circumstances
require me to care about you personally rather than the thing that I was
expecting to learn.</p>
<p>It’s certainly true that any story can be told in a way that
fascinates the maximum number of people who are capable of being
fascinated by it, and that style has a huge part to play in that. I’m in
favour of good writing style, of course I am, and of not writing in a
style that bores your audience, but it’s important to not overstate the
importance of style: You can’t <em>make</em> people fascinated by your
writing, except by writing about a subject that they will be fascinated
by when properly told, and sometimes that’s not the subject you’re there
to write about.</p>
