<h1 id="identity-and-legitimisation-of-knowledge">Identity and
Legitimisation of Knowledge</h1>
<p>PSA: Posts this week are going to be especially short because I need
to focus on actual writing for my PhD this week. I’ll just be copying
out interesting passages from random pages of random books from my
“canon” and making very short commentaries on them.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3d3aby7">Epistemic Injustice: Power and
the Ethics of Knowing</a> by Miranda Fricker, page 9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is easy to see that [a silencing of a woman by a man] involves an
exercise of power, of of gender power in particular. But what do we mean
by power? And how does gender power relate to the general notion of
social power? In order to paint a portrait of testimonial injustice and
to home in on its distinctive central case, we need to answer these
questions about the nature of social power in general and the particular
kind of social power (of which gender power is one instance) that I
shall call <em>identity</em> power.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “testimonial injustice” that Fricker is talking about here is a
notion she introduces in this book, and is an injustice done to people
in rejecting their testimony based on their identity - e.g. in the case
she is talking about, rejecting someone’s testimony because she is a
woman.</p>
<p>I’ve just finished reading Lyotard’s “The Postmodern Condition”, an
experience which I cannot really recommend, and in it he talks about the
role of <em>legitimisation</em> in knowledge - i.e. if we think of a
community of practice as telling each other stories about the world,
what are the social practices involved in accepting some of those
stories into our canon as legitimate knowledge. He argues that sciences
in particular can be thought of as having a set of particularly
stringent set of criteria for legitimisation, and tend to reject other
modes of legitimisation as hopelessly fuzzy and informal.</p>
<p>Read in this light, I think one interesting lens on Fricker’s work
would be this: One of the roles of social power is control over the
legitimisation process for knowledge. When social power is rooted in
identities, this has the particularly pernicious effect of resulting in
a community’s canon of recognised legitimate knowledge that systemically
underrepresents knowledge originating in marginalized groups.</p>
<p>However, as has been pointed out before by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.1.0024?seq=1">Kirsty
Dotson</a>, Fricker has badly misunderstood one aspect of the nature of
knowledge in a way that this highlights: There is no single canon, but
instead many loosely overlapping ones.</p>
<p>This misunderstanding is also present in her notion of identity
power. In fact, identity power does not exist, because social power does
not exist in individuals. Social power is a relationship between an
individual and a community. The same identity that denies you
credibility in one community may gain you credibility in another.</p>
<p>That is not to say that the problems of testimonial injustice she is
pointing out don’t exist - they absolutely do - but that they need to be
more carefully contextualised. “You’re only oppressed by the dominant
community who controls most of the economy” is not actually any more
reassuring than thinking you’re oppressed in some absolute sense, but
the fine grained distinction is still useful.</p>
<p>This is particularly significant in another book I’ve read recently,
which is James Scott’s <a href="https://amzn.to/2yzIMF8">Domination and
the Arts of Resistance</a>, where he introduces the idea of the
<em>hidden transcript</em> - essentially the canon of knowledge that is
present within a marginalised group and is actively concealed (possibly
by hiding it in plain sight) from the more dominant group.</p>
<p>Putting these together, one way of looking at Dotson’s notion of
contributory injustice, which is the refusal of dominant groups to take
on the ideas of the marginalised (e.g. white people refusing to
acknowledge the idea of racism), is that sometimes the transcripts of
marginalised groups are hidden by the marginalised, but equally often
they’re instead ignored by the powerful.</p>
