<p>Another draft bankruptcy post. This ended up being another
overambitious philosophy piece of the sort I haven’t really figured a
time or place to write.</p>
<p>I’ve since learned that these go better in a google doc. Maybe they’d
go better yet if I expanded my notebook site to have an essays section
now that I’ve got sidenotes and full pandoc support for references and
such.</p>
<p>Attention conservation notice: This piece is quite inside baseball. I
think it’s of interest to a general audience in where it ends up, which
is why it’s on the newsletter rather than the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/">notebook</a><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Editor’s note: lol never mind.</span>,
but it <em>starts</em> by arguing about the logical underpinnings of
Kantian ethics. You should not however require much philosophy
background to read it.</p>
<p>I’m currently doing a read through of Velleman’s “Self to Self”. You
can follow along with my increasingly frustrated noises I make as I try
to decode it on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxO1bY9tS9Kr1gkHMPa0kaJtIIIKxJgzH">my
YouTube channel</a> (Editor’s note: I also abandoned this series and
project), but be warned the production quality is approximately zero
these are very much notes I am taking in my reading.</p>
<p>I’m mostly still stuck on chapter 1, which is his introduction to
Kantian ethics. I find the content a frustrating mix of tantalisingly
close to pointing at something important I’m missing and just wildly
wrong. This post is an attempt to explain some of my frustrations with
it, try to make sense of what it might mean, and reconstruct something
that I think actually works and is pointing roughly in the same
direction, but definitely isn’t what Kant or Velleman mean.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-i-act-according-to-reasons">Why should I act
according to reasons?</h3>
<p>One of the core premises of Velleman’s account of Kantian ethics is
that we have a basic obligation to “act according to reasons”. He
justifies this as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Where we previously asked “Why should I act on my desire?” let us now
ask “Why should I act for reasons?” Shouldn’t this question open up a
route of escape from <em>all</em> requirements?</p>
<p>As soon as we ask why we should act for reasons, however, we can hear
something odd in our question. To ask “Why should I?” is to demand a
reason; and so to ask “Why should I act for reasons?” is to demand a
reason for acting for reasons. This demand implicitly concedes the very
authority that it purports to question – namely, the authority of
reasons. Why would we demand a reason if we didn’t envision acting for
it? If we really didn’t feel required to act for reasons, then a reason
for doing so certainly wouldn’t help. So there is something
self-defeating about asking for a reason to act for reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re like me, your response to this is something along the lines
of “What? No.” or possibly “What on earth are you talking about?”</p>
<p>This argument is too clever by half and relies in a fundamental way
on an ambiguity in the term “reason” that, once you resolve, causes the
argument to dissolve into uselessness.</p>
<p>The ambiguity is this: When you ask “Why should I do the thing?” the
answer to this is an <em>explanation</em> of why you should do the
thing<em>,</em> which may or may not itself be present prior to your
doing the thing.</p>
<p>An answer to the question “Why should I act according to reasons?” is
not necessarily providing the sort of reason that compels action,
because the answer is intrinsically descriptive.</p>
<p>The core problem in all of this is that it is attempting to weasel
out of the normative content of a “should” resting on you actually
caring about something by trying to figure something that you logically
must care about. But you can just not do that - I don’t need a logical
argument to care about not being hurt for example, I can do things to
avoid pain without needing a compelling logical justification for this.
“Because if you don’t the reason fairy will appear and hit you with a
big stick” is a <em>perfectly logically consistent</em> answer to “Why
should I act according to reasons?” that does not have any
circularity.</p>
<p>It grounds out the authority of reasons in the authority of pain, but
that’s fine if you’re willing to accept an ethics for human beings who
don’t like pain rather than an ethics for perfectly spherical ethicists
in a vacuum. It is only circular if you think “Why should I act to
minimise pain?” roots the authority of pain in the authority of reasons,
but that’s not what that question means - it is asking for an
explanation, not delegating authority, because the avoidance of pain
already has authority over you.</p>
<p>The rest of the chapter tacitly acknowledges all of this by basically
trying to work through a set of reasons for acting for reasons, it just
can’t say out loud because it’s built on this premise that reasons are
an inescapable<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">In general the idea of escapability of authority in
Velleman’s account of Kantian ethics seems (Editor’s note: What does it
seem?? I apparently left this sentence hanging)</span> source of authority.</p>
<p>This is a shame, because I think the actual source of the authority
of reasons is much more interesting.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-any-of-this-even-mean">What does any of this even
mean?</h3>
<p>I think Velleman considers the meaning of “act according to reasons”
self-explanatory, but I think it’s not just not self-explanatory but
borders on meaningless given the ambiguity of the word “reasons”. If a
“reason” is a thing that causes something, then the obligation is
tautologically satisfied - all your actions are caused by something. If
a “reason” is a verbal explanation of why things happened as they did,
then it will generally come after the fact rather than prior to it -
almost everything we do well, we do without a significant amount of
verbal reasoning prior to it.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">For an elaboration on this last point, I recommend “The
Enigma of Reason” by Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier, and “Sources of
Power” by Gary Klein</span></p>
<p>Throughout, I will use “<strong>reason</strong>” to mean something
like “verbal causal explanation” - i.e. something you would say in
answer to a “Why?” question. I will use <strong>actual cause</strong> to
refer to something like… the state of the world that lead to a
particular outcome, a set of conditions which would lead to the same
outcome reliably. A <strong>reason</strong> is a <em>necessarily
incomplete</em> description of the <strong>actual cause</strong>.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I’m using bold here to indicate that I intend these to
be precise terms which are compatible with but more specific than
colloquial meanings. When I use a bolded term without bolding I will
usually be referring to someone else using the colloquial word. Or I
forgot.</span></p>
<p>Importantly, <strong>reasons</strong> are not normally present in our
mind at the point of action (they can be, but not necessarily). So when
you are acting “according” to a <strong>reason</strong>, in that the
reason accurately describes the <strong>actual cause</strong>, that
reason is not itself <em>part</em> of the <strong>actual cause</strong>.
This is what I mean by the argument resting on an ambiguity: If you are
asking for a <strong>reason</strong> to act in accordance with
<strong>reasons</strong>, the fact that you can answer the question does
not create a circularity because your answer need not be part of the
<strong>actual cause</strong> for acting for reasons.</p>
<p>One easy way to see this is that often the <strong>actual
cause</strong> exists prior to it being possible to give an explanation
for it. This is especially true for causes that are in some sense
physical. e.g. if you ask me why I’m not working my best today and I
have a low grade virus that is sapping my energy, that is part of the
<strong>actual cause</strong> regardless of whether I know I have a
virus, or even have the concept of virus. Both “I have a virus” and “I
don’t know, I’m just not feeling it today” count as
<strong>reasons</strong>. I could even answer “I’m lazy”, which would
arguably count as an incorrect <strong>reason</strong>.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is often far more <strong>reason</strong> than
you are aware of in the moment, so you <em>could not</em> have thought
of all the reasons in the time you had prior to action. Suppose you see
someone who has injured themself. You help them get to a safe place, and
then call the emergency services. Why did you do this? Because they were
hurt. Why is “because they were hurt” a sufficient
<strong>reason</strong>? Because it’s morally the right thing to do. Why
must you do the morally right thing? Because I want to, and will feel
guilty if I don’t. Why would you feel guilty if you didn’t? Because I
was raised proper… etc.</p>
<p>There is a long chain of verbal <strong>reasons</strong> you can give
for this and <em>almost none of them went through your head when you
helped</em>. You might have verbalised something like “Oh they’re
injured, I should help them”. Maybe you considered a couple arguments
and counter-arguments. But there was not a long chain of verbal
reasoning for why you should help them, the helping comes with an
immediacy of its own as the thing for you to do.</p>
<p>The <strong>actual cause</strong> is thus not the reasons you give
for it, because those reasons were not present at the point of action.
The <strong>actual cause</strong> is necessarily something like “because
I am the kind of person who in these kinds of circumstances performs
these kinds of actions”, with the <strong>reasons</strong> attempting to
define some boundaries on all of those “kind of”s.</p>
<p>This should, I think, still be considered acting <em>according</em>
to <strong>reasons</strong>, in that “I helped them because they were
hurt” is a <strong>reason</strong> that accurately describes your
actions.</p>
<p>This is, however, now a very weak requirement. All it demands is that
your actions be in some way comprehensible. “I helped him because his
shirt was yellow”, or “I helped him because I felt like it” are both
also potential <strong>reasons</strong>. This weakness is not a failing
of the Kantian account, which is in many ways all about deciding what
counts as a good <strong>reason</strong> (although I think it is
incorrect in how it goes about doing this), it’s just important to point
out because we’re also going to need to strengthen it.</p>
<p>Two directions that I think are reasonable to strengthen it are as
follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You should be able to provide <strong>reasons</strong> for your
actions to peers (that it’s to peers will be significant later) who want
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Those <strong>reasons</strong> should remain relatively stable,
in the sense that if they would apply in future then they should contain
to describe your actions, or you should be able to provide a
<strong>reason</strong> why they don’t.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What does “should” mean here? i.e. why should you act according to
<strong>reasons</strong> in this sense? Kant and Velleman want this to
be through logical necessity, but I don’t think that’s valid, and I
think the weaker form that I am aiming at here is in many ways better.
It allows for more empirically accurate descriptions of how ethics
works, and in many cases by being weaker allows for stronger norms.</p>
<p>Anyway, my answer is that you should because life will go better for
you if you do.</p>
<h3 id="norming-and-consequences">Norming and consequences</h3>
<p>One of the things we do in our groups of peers is we create norms of
behaviour. What is, and isn’t, an acceptable to behave. We do this by
imposing consequences for that behaviour - we might chastise each other
for bad behaviour, withdraw future opportunities, etc. e.g. you might
not get a promotion if you behave badly at work, or you might just get
reprimanded the first time, in an extreme case you might get fired.
Similarly if you behave like a dick at a party I invited you to, you’re
not going to get invited back. Extreme cases might also include e.g.
physical violence, but most norming tends to be at least slightly more
subtle than this.</p>
<p>Evaluating reasons is part of how we do this. When someone does
something, especially something we disapprove of, we will often ask why
they did it, and this factors in to our evaluation of their
behaviour.</p>
<p>e.g. suppose we’re going to the movies together. I’m waiting for you
at the cinema and you never show, even by the time the movie was
supposed to have <em>ended</em> let alone started. You’ve not sent me a
text, you’re not responding to mine. By default, I’m likely to be pretty
pissed off at you.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">There’s likely some cultural variation in this,
especially if you’re merely late - I’m a stickler for punctuality, but
know people from places where turning up an hour late is considered
completely normal. Regardless though, I’m not making a universal claim
that it is <em>right</em> to be pissed off about this, I’m saying that I
would be. Feel free to substitute your own example of someone letting
you down.</span></p>
<p>It is likely that when we finally make contact, my first question is
going to be some variant on “What happened?” - I expect you to provide a
<strong>reason</strong> for the fact that you didn’t show when we’d
previously agreed to.</p>
<p>Consider how I might respond differently to the following three
answers:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“I don’t know, no reason really, I just didn’t feel like it.”</li>
<li>“I got the day wrong, was caught up in work, and didn’t hear the
notification and completely forgot.”</li>
<li>“I was on my way here and there was someone in a terrible accident
and I had to stop and help and keep them conscious while waiting for the
ambulance.”</li>
</ol>
<p>These would change my response significantly. (1) would probably make
me <em>more</em> angry at you. (2) would probably reduce my anger a bit,
with how sorry you seemed about it and how many times you’d made this
sort of error error mattering more than the actual
<strong>reason</strong>. (3) on the other hand my anger would probably
instantly evaporate, because I would agree that under these
circumstances that was completely the right thing to do. Indeed, if
instead you’d turned up and told me that there was such an accident but
you didn’t stop to help because it would make you late to the cinema,
I’d probably be angry at you for an entire different reason - of course
you shouldn’t prioritise going to the movies with me over helping
someone.</p>
<p>Part of this judgement is that we now have more context for the
action, and we can now ask not just how we feel about this particular
outcome, but how we feel about the process that lead to it. i.e. if
similar circumstances were to occur again, and you were to behave in the
same way in them, how would I feel about that?</p>
<p>This is a very lightened version of Kant’s categorical imperative.
Instead of asking whether you are acting according to
<strong>reasons</strong> that constitute <em>universal</em> law, we are
asking wether in our particular relational context your
<strong>reasons</strong> are ones I would consider acceptable if they
consistently described your behaviour. Your behaviour is judged not
based on its consequences, but on what the <em>generalisation</em> of it
(as described by your provided <strong>reasons</strong>) looks like. By
requesting <strong>reasons</strong>, we can judge you (positively as
well as negatively) not just by your one-off actions but by <em>how you
tend to behave -</em> i.e. what sort of person you are.</p>
<h3 id="trusting-our-peers">Trusting our peers</h3>
<p>Of course, I can only judge what sort of person you are based on your
reasons for action if the <strong>reason</strong> you provide is one
that you are likely to act in accord with in future.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of C. Thi Nguyen’s paper “Trust as an unquestioning
attitude”. My light generalisation of it is that you
<strong>trust</strong> that X to the degree that you do not really have
to entertain the possibility of not X. e.g. you <strong>trust</strong>
that the sun will come up tomorrow, because even if you think about
whether or not it will the possibility that it will not seems neither
plausible nor emotionally relevant. You <strong>trust</strong> that your
partner is not secretly a serial killer because if you think about the
possibility it doesn’t seem remotely plausible. You also
<strong>trust</strong> to a lesser extent that your long-term business
partner isn’t going to betray you, your friends don’t secretly hate you,
etc. - it’s not that there is zero concern here, and you may worry about
it a bit, but it’s not a major part of your day to day experience.</p>
<p>Importantly, you <strong>trust</strong> that something will or won’t
happen. You might <strong>trust</strong> totally that someone won’t
betray you, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you
<strong>trust</strong> them to fly a plane.</p>
<p>You can still <strong>trust</strong> someone in a more generalised
sense, in that the better you know them the more you
<strong>trust</strong> about them. When I first meet someone I can’t
<strong>trust</strong> that they won’t be a dick to me, or that they’re
reliable, or that they are fun to be around, but as I get to know them
better I learn the ways in which I can <strong>trust</strong> them (and
the ways I cannot).</p>
<h3 id="afterword">Afterword</h3>
<p>I actually still think that there’s something important here and I’d
like to try to revisit it at some point, but I think this kind of
dissecting of someone else’s arguments isn’t really for me.</p>
<p>In particular the role of trust and reason in constituting our moral
behaviour is something that I’ve been thinking about since and would
like to try to articulate more at some point.</p>
