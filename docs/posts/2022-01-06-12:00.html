<p>One of the ways my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-03-14:16.html">current
difficulty with motivation</a> plays out is that I spend a lot of my day
drifting. Left to my own devices my day probably won’t be
<em>completely</em> drifting, but I might spend an hour or so on
something I’d actually endorse as worthwhile. One of the reasons why
daily writing is good for me is that it claws back another hour or so
from the drift. This is, presumably, also why I sometimes find it hard
to sustain.</p>
<p>Drifting is like… evil flow. It absorbs the totality of your being in
the same way, but you’re left feeling entirely unnourished by it. Flow
is what happens when you’re able to absorb yourself entirely in the
achievement of some end. Drifting is what happens when absorbing
yourself entirely <em>is</em> the end, a way to dissociate from the
world. Drifting is <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/first-hard-choice">eating the
lotus</a>.</p>
<p>For me drifting tends to be spending time on Twitter, or watching
youtube, it might be reading truly execrable Royal Road quality fiction,
or if there’s a new TV series to binge I might lose a day doing that. It
probably <em>isn’t</em> playing games. The games I play tend not to be
drifting games, because I’ve learned the hard way just how bad they are
for me and in a rare case of being sensible about this I avoid drifting
games. This is why I don’t play Cookie Clickers.</p>
<p>(Slay the Spire is interesting in that it can be either drifting or
flow - at low ascensions you can absolutely play it as a drifting game,
but if you do that at high ascensions you die to Gremlin Nob. All of my
Slay the Spire drifting time seems to have been adequately satisfied by
watching other people play it on YouTube though)</p>
<p>A lot of my time is spent in this drifting state - not really doing
anything useful, but also not following any sort of interesting
direction. This is why I don’t really feel like it’s right to
characterise my relationship with curiousity as only being able to do
useful things: It doesn’t seem to be based in a strong desire to be
useful. Idly following my curiosity in whatever direction brings me joy
would be significantly more useful than most of how I spend my days.</p>
<p>But apparently that’s not what I want to do. What I want to do is
drift.</p>
<p>Except, that’s not quite right. It’s not that I want to drift - the
idea almost feels contradictory. It’s more that drifting is an easy
state to fall into. Not drifting requires active effort, and I don’t
want to spend that effort.</p>
<p>None of these are endorsed preferences of course. I want to want to
spend that effort, and ideally I want to want to spend it on fun things
as well as useful things. But in the moment what I apparently choose,
most of the time, is drifting instead.</p>
<p>The aversion to effort does feel like a key part of it. It’s not an
aversion to things I think I “should” be doing exactly - going for a
walk or cooking a nice meal are equally prone to being avoided as
reading and writing are. But they seem like too much work.</p>
<p>There seem to be two distinct triggers for this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Unable to generate the worthwhile activity in the first place.
Making it easy to generate good activities seems to help a bit here. For
example having habits around good quality reading seem to result in more
of that. Having a daily writing habit makes it easier for writing to
feel salient.</li>
<li>Unable to stick to the worthwhile activity - I start writing, or
doing something useful, and then I reach a point where it feels
unbearable to maintain my focus on this for any longer and I check
Twitter or otherwise take a break “briefly” and often it’s not so brief.
This is particularly prone for things that I very much don’t want to
do.</li>
</ol>
<p>The trigger for this does often seem to be unpleasant feelings come
up when trying to focus and falling back to drift. I’d like to think I
was good at dealing with unpleasant feelings, but the reality is that
I’m probably quite bad at it. I think it’s also telling that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html">the
thing I often need to do to get to sleep right now</a> is to
deliberately induce a drifting state.</p>
<p>Internally the urge to drift feels like I’m “too tired” to do things,
but this seems to be fake, or rather it’s not tiredness in that sense.
Probably it’s a Freeze reaction of some sort.</p>
<p>The reason I don’t think it’s real tiredness is how much of this goes
away as soon as soon as there are other people involved. Often I’ll
spend an entire morning drifting, and then get on a call with someone
and be absolutely fine.</p>
<p>This of course tends to result in people thinking I’m in a much
better state than I actually am a lot of the time, because I’m fine when
interacting with them and stop being fine as soon as I stop
interacting.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even have to really be <em>interacting</em> with the other
person. On Monday a friend and I got on a call together as a way of
motivating each other to get things done, turned off our microphones for
an hour, and then checked back in at the end of the call. In that call I
did all of the accounting and tax admin I’d been putting off for months
(and learned I had about £800 of unpaid invoices. Turns out checking
whether people have paid you is good). Normally this is maximally
aversive task that would <em>definitely</em> have resulted in me losing
track of myself about 5 minutes in.</p>
<p>Something like this also often happens with tweeting. I say Twitter
is drifting, but that’s not quite right. Writing on Twitter is often
flow, or at least interesting and worthwhile. What happens sometimes is
that I’m drifting and then suddenly there are Thoughts! which have to be
expressed, I coalesce into a person for about 10 minutes and hop on
Twitter to express them. But then I’m done, and I dissociate again.</p>
<p>What’s really drifting is checking Twitter, especially my
notifications. People often describe this as waiting for the dopamine
hit, but it doesn’t really feel like a reward, it’s more that I’m
waiting for something to happen, and until then my brain is in idle
mode. Thinking at the speed of likes.</p>
<p>How bad this is comes and goes. December was the worst for this, but
probably that’s partly because I was ill a lot on December. Right now
it’s moderately bad, but feels like it’s letting up.</p>
<p>It never really goes away though unless I have some project I’m able
to obsessively work on, which is a state that rarely lasts more than
weeks, or I have people to work with (or at least in the company of).
Conveniently both of those are 2022 goals, so this problem may be solved
as a byproduct of that, but I sure wish I had a clearer idea of why this
happens.</p>
