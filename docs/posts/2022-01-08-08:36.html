<h1 id="grappling-with-vastness">Grappling with vastness</h1>
<p>It turns out I’ve written about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html">drifting</a>
before, albeit obliquely, in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/why-is-it-hard-to-choose-what-to">Why
is it hard to choose what to do?</a> where I talked about the difference
between proactive and reactive work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One reason why I’m interested in this split is that I’ve found that
how proactive I’m able to be is a pretty reliable predictor of my mental
health. On a bad day, the ability to be proactive goes long before the
ability to be competently reactive.</p>
<p>For example, I often find myself having days where if you dropped me
in a coaching call I would be perfectly alert and useful and able to do
a decent job, and between calls I get nothing done1 - I check Twitter,
or I watch YouTube, play a game, or maybe (probably not) I go for a walk
or do some cleaning or the like.</p>
<p>The way this feels internally is that I’m perfectly able to do
things, but what I’m unable to do is generate things to do. This is
unfortunate, as in theory I have lots of free time and the ability to do
quite interesting things, but often they don’t get done anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is, on a bad mental health day, faced with the requirement to
choose what to do, I drift.</p>
<p>Rereading this piece makes the difference between my newsletter and
my current notebook writing fairly clear I think. It’s a very
intellectual approach to the problem - it’s not that I don’t talk about
the feelings involved, but even there it speculates about them in a very
detached way that I’m not sure is entirely helpful.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1478122278307041280">Adam
puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what if your cognitivist problems like “akrasia” and “low executive
function” are actually emotional problems like “this scares me” or “i
don’t actually care”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I noted that drifting feels a lot like a freeze response (“I’m too
tired to do anything” is a common feeling leading to drifting), and,
well, maybe it is. Maybe I encounter the vastness of free choice
available to me and Freeze in response to it.</p>
<p>It’s not hard to see little versions of this sort of response.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What should I do with my life?</li>
<li>What should I do today?</li>
<li>What should I write today?</li>
<li>What should I write on my notebook today?</li>
<li>What should I write on my notebook today about what I’ve been
thinking about recently?</li>
</ol>
<p>As you move down the list the possibilities become more constrained,
until it becomes narrower and more tractable. Towards the beginning of
the list, you have to confront the vastness, and that’s scary.</p>
<p>The problem isn’t just that you have to make a choice from within
infinite possibilities. It’s that you have to grapple with your agency
over those choices, and confront your lack thereof.</p>
<p>I started writing about how the problem was infinite freedom and some
part of me rebelled, because it’s not, is it? In fact there is very
little freedom right now, and dealing with “What should I do today?”
causes me to confront that head on, let alone “What should I do with my
life?”. Given free choice over what to do today I’d probably try to hang
out with a group of friends in person, but even in the before times
that’s hard to organise on short notice, and right now it’s all but
impossible (or at least feels like a bad idea).</p>
<p>Choosing smaller problems allows me to grapple with things that are
my size, and that I know I can handle, but as I expand the scope, I have
to grapple with a world of possibilities that is vastly larger than me,
and could easily crush me as and when it fights back, and honestly,
yeah, this scares me.</p>
