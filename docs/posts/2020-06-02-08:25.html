<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew">Talking About Machines</a> by
Julian Orr, page 35:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>their [team] has developed personal bonds in addition to their
professional association, including friendship outside the job. His
narration reveals a division among technicians over the propriety of
such bonds, and while he clearly values them, he is wary of revealing
them to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The question of whether you should be friends with your coworkers is
an interesting one. For me the answer is “Obviously yes, except it’s
kinda problematic.”</p>
<p>At a personal level, being friends with your coworkers is good.
You’re going to spend a <em>lot</em> of your time together, and your
life will be improved if you actually like spending time together.</p>
<p>At a professional level, being friends with your coworkers is also
good: It significantly improves your team productivity. One of the
things that is clear from Orr’s book is that talking to each other,
swapping war stories, sharing technical problems and advice, is almost
inseparable from having a friendly conversation with each other. This
isn’t the equivalent of having a daily standup or a team meeting, it’s a
conversation, and it’s much easier to have conversations with your
friends. These conversations are an essential part of learning together
and sharing important information.</p>
<p>Being friends with your coworkers makes literally everything better,
and it is very hard to have a functioning company without a certain
amount of bonds of friendship.</p>
<p>Also… this is how marginalisation works and reinforces itself,
because not everybody can easily be friends with their coworkers.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/da6a33be-bd8f-11e8-8274-55b72926558f">this
piece from the FT</a> (apologies for the paywall):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was an instant, if brutal, reminder of the value of smoking at
work. It is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of finding out
what is really going on in the office.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>I am indebted to a reader for my favourite ploy: an office beer
fridge. A man from the US who has started and managed several companies
wrote to tell me on-site grog had several proven benefits. Everyone got
to know each other quickly, he said, “from production worker to the
CEO”, and that made a big difference to the way they worked with one
another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sorts of nonwork activities that promote socialisation end up
being extremely good for establishing lines of information and common
knowledge within the company that run orthogonally to formal lines of
information.</p>
<p>Also, both smoking and drinking are hugely exclusionary ways of
setting up those lines, right? They’re <em>effective</em>, but they’re
effective for the people who are willing to participate them.
Personally, I don’t mind office drinking (but no thanks on the beer),
and will find the presence of smokers around the office actively
unpleasant, never mind <em>joining</em> them.</p>
<p>Many people have had bad experiences with alcohol, or avoid it for
religious reasons, and above and beyond not drinking will not be at all
comfortable around people who are drinking. It also tends to exacerbate
other ways in which a group is exclusionary - if you’re part of an
underrepresented minority, people who are on their best behaviour while
sober may start to show their true colours while drunk (and even if it
turns out that their true colours are actually that they’re perfectly
nice people and there are zero problems, it’s hard to know that in
advance and this prevents the event from being relaxing and
enjoyable).</p>
<p>There is a lot of criticism of the tech industry’s reliance on
alcohol for social bonding on grounds of it being exclusionary, and this
criticism is entirely correct.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the criticism tends not to get listened to, for one
very simple reason: Drinking as a way of socialising works really well,
and without something to replace it, this criticism asks the majority to
make a significant personal sacrifice for the minority’s comfort. This
doesn’t tend to go well. Should the majority do it? Well, maybe. But you
need to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-19-09:35.html">work
with the audience that you have</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you overcome this and find a perfectly innocuous way of doing
team socialisation, you end up with issues of conflicting identity.</p>
<p>I was at a London <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a>
meetup group right before lockdown started, and someone there suggested
that on Mondays they tried to get a lot of discussion going between
people about what they’d done over their weekend, as a kind of ice
breaker / social bonding exercise.</p>
<p>I gently suggested to them that this might not work so well because
you’re trying to force people to disclose things they may not want to
disclose. People don’t generally want to tell their coworkers that they
spent the weekend at a sex party (this is a common problem among my
friend group).</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be a sex party either. People are probably equally
unwilling to tell their staunchly atheist coworkers that they spent the
weekend at a bible study. Telling people that they spent their weekend
at a protest risks office politics.</p>
<p>More innocuously, you have a divide between parents and non parents.
If a parent talks about how they spent their weekend with their kids,
the other parents in the room may join in talking about their kids,
while the non-parents sit there twiddling their thumbs. Or, equally, if
you’re the only parent in the room and everyone is talking about the fun
things they were up to this weekend and you were mostly doing childcare
duties.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem here is that we are too used to playing
friendship on easy mode and largely lack the skill of having
heterogenous friends groups. It’s much easier to be friends if you can
find strong points of commonality with each other and minimise points of
conflict. When your main point of commonality is that you work together,
you will often lack that easy mode.</p>
<p>The problem gets worse when you take into account that some people
actually just may not be able to make friends that easily. They may be
lacking in social skills, or they may just be kinda traumatised and find
it difficult to trust people. Many of these people are lovely,
brilliant, people, and even those who aren’t probably need to work
<em>somewhere</em> - because, alas, capitalism. How do we make a system
that works for them?</p>
<p>Also, when you try to deliberately help those people integrate, this
may seem like an attack on them, because it reads like a social test
that they can fail.</p>
<p>All of these problems are, I think, even worse at a small company. I
wrote about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-25-10:40.html">the
problem with not fitting in in small towns</a> before, and small
companies are like that but more so. If you work in an office with a
thousand other people there are probably others like you there (whether
you can find them is another issue). That doesn’t necessarily solve your
problem if you’re not on their team, but it at least <em>helps</em>. If
you work at a company of five other people, chances are good that you
have a number of traits that are unique to you, and some of those may be
ones that result in you being excluded.</p>
<p>It is at this point that I reveal the easy, brilliant, and obvious
solution that will solve all of these problems.</p>
<p>Err.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s not. I was kinda hoping you would do that for me. Because
this problem seems like a giant insoluble mess and I barely have any
idea where to start - any solution seems far too contextual for me to
propose any general principles.</p>
<p>Mostly I’d like people to start by acknowledging the problem: Being
friends with your coworkers is important and valuable, and currently we
only make it accessible to people who get to play friendship on easy
mode.</p>
