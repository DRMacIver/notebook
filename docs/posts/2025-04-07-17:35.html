<p>Here’s a useful idea that I often mention in passing and people seem
to find helpful but I don’t think have ever written down as its own
thing: Digital objects lack object permanence. That is, they stop
existing for you when you stop looking at them.</p>
<p>I first started noticing this with the kindle. I like having physical
books partly because I can stop reading them and they don’t go away and
I can pick them up later. It’s vastly easier for me to juggle multiple
physical books because they’re real in a way that digital ones aren’t.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is aggravated by Kindle’s library management being
terrible, but I think it would happen even without that.</span></p>
<p>I’ve also noticed this with e.g. things I’m writing. I have many half
abandoned Google docs with stuff I was writing that felt very important
at the time and I just forgot. In contrast, I relatively rarely forget
e.g. the essay I’m currently writing on my typewriter, because it’s
right there.</p>
<p>Conversely though, I also never really forget about this notebook, or
my substack to a lesser degree. I sometimes go long periods without
touching them but that’s not because they stop existing.</p>
<p>I think they have two major features that cause this to happen:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Rather than being objects, they are <em>places</em>, and they are
places where I put public content, so an object that goes into them
<em>doesn’t need</em> to be permanent to me, because it exists for other
people.</li>
<li>They act as <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-05-10:53.html"><em>sinks</em></a>
for when I want to think about something in writing, so there is a
natural thing that keeps me coming back to them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Digital places that act as sources also seem to have a degree of
permanence, but I find it often feels like it achieves that permanence
through addiction. You’re not going to forget that Twitter exists,
because you’ve got a twitchy reflex to click it. I think you probably
<em>can</em> have digital places that act as non-addictive sources, but
it doesn’t seem to be where we’ve ended up in design space. I think some
of that is just incentive following, but it does feel genuinely
hard.</p>
