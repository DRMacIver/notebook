<p>The biggest problem with this book for me is that it is not really
<em>about</em> writing to learn, instead writing to learn is better
thought of as its recurring theme.</p>
<p>The book exemplifies a style that it also advocates for: Personal,
privileging peple over knowledge. Every piece of information should be
presented in the context of a story, and about how the people relate to
that knowledge.</p>
<p>I’m not a huge fan of this style. I think it can work, and certainly
personal books of the type it encourages are fine (and sometimes even
great), but as a way of presenting knowledge I think it fails. The point
being made is obfuscated by being tangled up in the story, while the
story suffers because I’m constantly thinking “OK get to the point” and
thus want to rush through the story.</p>
<p>As, frankly, happens in this book. The book is well written, and
contains a lot of interesting examples of good writing. I think if I
hadn’t been wanting to learn more about its actual theme of “writing to
learn” and just sat back to enjoy it as a piece of writing I would have
liked it a lot more.</p>
<p>The actual structure of the book is roughly this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The fact that writing is left to the English department to teach
does an injustice to the student and to the teachers - writing is better
integrated across the curriculum.</li>
<li>A couple of useful pieces of information about how to integrate
that.
<ul>
<li>Get people to use writing to make their reasoning process
explicit.</li>
<li>Require well-written essay answers on exams, but if an answer is
correct but poorly written, give students an opportunity to revisit it,
with the help of a writing workshop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A very large number of anecdotal and extract evidence of the fairly
obvious proposition that yes you really can write well in any
field.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m particularly disappointed by the third part because almost none
of these felt like examples of people writing to learn - they were
almost all examples of writing to teach.</p>
