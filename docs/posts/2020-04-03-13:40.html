<h1 id="anxiety-vs-worry">Anxiety vs Worry</h1>
<p>Here is a distinction I’ve found useful recently: You are
<em>anxious</em> about something if the emotion attaches to the
uncertainty in the situation, you are <em>worried</em> about something
if the emotion attaches to the possible outcomes.</p>
<p>NB that this doesn’t <em>perfectly</em> track colloquial usage, but I
think it works pretty well with it. Also if you’re not sure how to tell
what the emotion attaches to, may I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2UWXQDL">Focusing</a>?</p>
<p>It’s certainly possible to worry about things without being
particularly anxious about them. Sensible precautions often work like
this: e.g. I lock my door because I’m worried that if I don’t people
might otherwise come in and steal stuff, but there’s no anxiety attached
to that worry because it’s just something I can act on to limit the
chances.</p>
<p>You can be anxious without worry in situations when all of the
potential outcomes are positive (it’s also possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misattribution_of_arousal">to
mistake excitement for anxiety</a> in these scenarios, but the anxiety
can be real too). If one possible outcome</p>
<p>Anxiety and worry are far from mutually exclusive, and indeed tend to
go hand in hand, but it is worth <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html">untangling</a>
the two conceptually, and even where both are present they are still
different emotions.</p>
<p>For example, with COVID-19, I am <em>worried</em> about specific
outcomes - harm to people in general, harm to people I love, overall
negative societal effects, but am also also COVID-19 has more or less
destroyed my ability to reason about the future, and that makes me
<em>anxious</em>.</p>
<p>In the COVID-19 case the anxiety feels almost more like an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html">existential
feeling</a> - there’s not a specific thing I’m anxious about so much as
a general sense that the unknown unknowns are dwarfing the known
unknowns, let alone the known knowns (the unknown knowns remain huge
given how ideological responses are being). The thing that is making me
anxious is the uncertainty itself, not the bad outcomes possible.</p>
<p>Reducing worry is often more tractable than reducing anxiety, because
you can reduce worry by planning. If you have a scenario you’re worried
about, you can ensure that you’re prepared for it (e.g. COVID-19
precautions, or talking through your concerns about a situation with the
people involved before you get into it). I like Chris Hadfield’s advice
for dealing with worry, which is “Figure out the next thing that’s going
to kill you” - plan for the worst, and convince yourself you can handle
it. Also often what you’re worrying about is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-03-09:07.html">outdated
scenarios that no longer apply</a>, so <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">learning
to debug that can help with this</a>.</p>
<p>Anxiety can be resolved by reducing uncertainty by making the
situation more deterministic, but often that’s not a good idea! <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">A
certain amount of nondeterminism is often very useful</a>, and many of
the ways to reduce uncertainty do this by increasing the chances of
failure (e.g. procrastination until it’s too late to do a good job).</p>
<p>There are a couple of things you can do:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Focus on any worries first, because often a lack of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a>
is the thing that makes uncertainty uncomfortable. Uncertainty isn’t
intrinsically bad, because if you’re always certain you’ll never learn
anything.</li>
<li>See if you can reframe any of the anxiety. For example, you can be
uncertain about the outcome but certain of your ability to handle it.
Can you focus on that? Are there good things about the uncertainty too?
Can you appreciate those as excitement? (This one rarely to never works
for me)</li>
<li>If you’ve managed to get your anxiety down to a low enough level, it
can be worth practicing a certain amount of discomfort tolerance.
Anxiety isn’t intrinsically bad, it may be telling you useful
information about the world, so the correct amount of anxiety may be
non-zero, and it’s important to acknowledge that and be prepared to sit
with it.</li>
<li>If you’ve not managed to get your anxiety down to a low enough
level, often me neither I’m afraid (I’ve got a lot better since I’ve
acquired the “legacy code” tools). Consult someone with better advice
than me and let me know what they said.</li>
