<p>I’ve previously written <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-06-05-14:53.html">Getting
to know the right people</a> about how it’s very hard to find quality
tradespeople and the best way to do it is through networking from
existing quality tradespeople, but there’s a bootstrapping problem of
how you find the original ones. I’ve now figured out the solution to
this problem and it’s sortof embarrassingly easy.</p>
<p>It’s this: You find your local Facebook group<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">You almost certainly have a local Facebook group. I live
in a small town and there’s a 20k strong group for it and a few
neighbouring towns. Looking at the last two places I lived in London I
also find such groups</span> and
ask there whether anyone can recommend someone to do this. This will
give you a mix of potential candidates responding to you directly and
recommendations from people who have had good experiences. The latter
aren’t <em>necessarily</em> trustworthy, but they’re still a decent
positive signal.</p>
<p>I wrote about this a bit in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-20-12:01.html">the
post on developing capacities</a>, but I’m taking advantage of it again
right now and it felt like it was worth its own post, where I used the
group to find a PA.</p>
<p>The PA in question unfortunately hasn’t really worked out, which is
representative of the problem in the original “getting to know the right
people” post. The title of this post is <em>help</em> is easy to find
these days, but that doesn’t mean <em>good</em> help is. You still have
to find reliable people. But with the PA not having worked out, I’ll
just be going back to the original post and looking through the 5-10
other responses. There are plenty of candidates, some of whom are
vouched for, and it’s easy enough to try them out.</p>
<p>I’ll have to find a different trial task though, because now that
I’ve got this approach just finding us a cleaner is a bit too easy of a
task. I’ve replied to a cleaner who got in touch regarding our initial
PA posting (I mentioned this as an example task there) and they’re
coming by on Thursday.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Or possibly they’ll come by on Thursday, be a disaster,
and we’ll have this task live again. Who knows?</span></p>
<p>But for me this is a much easier approach than previously where I was
using Google, because there I have to search, then I have to contact
them, and so on. Cold contacting is the worst, and also it tends to
result in a very rate of non or negative answers. e.g. when I last
looked for cleaners I did try contacting a couple and none of them had
availability. In contrast, asking for people on the Facebook group
heavily selects for people who have availability, and more importantly
they will come to you for you to respond to, which is much easier.</p>
<p>I think it particularly helps to start this with lots of easy
problems, because then you end up building up a network of people early
on before you really need it. e.g. A cleaner or a PA are much lower risk
things to try out than a plumber, because when they get things wrong it
doesn’t generally flood your house.</p>
