<p>Of the back of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-24-22:09.html">my
realisation that I was standing on one leg wrong</a> I had another
important insight of this type: I was walking wrong, and I could just
walk right instead..</p>
<p>It’s a longstanding problem of mine that I have flat feet, and this
causes a lot of problems for my legs, especially my right leg. This
causes my knees to bow inwards and generally seems to underly a lot of
my general physical problems.</p>
<p>During a walk the other day after I figured out the standing on one
leg thing, I had an important insight: I could just walk
differently.</p>
<p>Here’s what I said on discord at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have a longstanding problem with flat feet. Major issue, arguably
my most basic one that creates all my other body issues</p>
<p>I’ve tried a bunch of things to fix this (albeit not very diligently)
and nothing seems to have helped</p>
<p>And I’ve just figured out the solution and it’s so fucking
annoying</p>
<p>Which is to pay attention to my feet while I’m walking and stop
walking with them flat</p>
<p>And to be clear this is much harder. It feels difficult and
unnatural. But I think that’s actually a sign that it’s working for
building muscles I’ve neglected</p>
<p>(In answer to a question about how) To a large degree arch is a thing
you do not a thing you have. But more specifically I guess: roll your
feet outwards so that more or the weight is on the outside of the
foot</p>
<p>Like a lot of “flat feet” is really about letting what arch there is
collapse inwards</p>
<p>I also wear barefoot shoes and have been puzzled at how little they
helped, and I think the reason is that they’re a bottleneck on fixing
the habit of walking wrong but removing that bottleneck doesn’t cause
the habit to fix itself.</p>
<p>I think I’ve been working on a wrong implicit model where I’ve
treated physical problems as things that will fix themselves if you work
on the necessary muscles and stop doing the thing that creates the
problem, but the correct model is maybe more like “make sure you’re
using the right muscles and motions and that will strengthen the muscles
you need for doing it right directly”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway I’ve been practicing this exercise on and off for a few days
and… turns out this is wrong.</p>
<p>I’d started to have suspicions this morning when I tried practicing
the position when standing in the shower, and noticed how much it
scrunched my toes up. That’s very much not the toe position of a healthy
walk.</p>
<p>Then I went to my one on one Pilates session and asked to go off
script and basically just focus on gait and leg exercises.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This isn’t really a pilates thing, I’m just relying on
my teacher’s broader expertise in body mechanics.</span>. We
concluded that basically this was just walking differently wrong, wasn’t
actually exercising the right muscles, and probably was bad for my
hips.</p>
<p>I do think that the core insight that you can just walk differently
is good and I will be drawing on it, but I think probably (as various
people pointed out to me on discord) it’s never going to be quite this
easy. If you’re walking wrong you probably need to put in some active
effort into learning what walking right looks like, and yes developing
the muscles in question with some more basic movements, rather than just
lifting up your arches and expecting the problem to be solved.</p>
