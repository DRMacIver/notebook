<p>Recently I’ve been experimenting with a bunch of different styles of
writing. Some of these are in public under my real name, others aren’t.
<a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/first-hard-choice">The First
Hard Choice</a> is an example of me doing this on my newsletter.</p>
<p>On Twitter I recently described this as “writing from the id”:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

There's a writing trick I've figured out recently that is something like
"writing from the id" and gosh I cannot exactly recommend it but it sure
is interesting.

<p>What I mean by this is that you just narrow in on a feeling that
exists in your subconscious and pull on the thread and see what comes
out, without any real concern about what you are trying to do or who you
are trying to do it for other than yourself, and your success depends
largely on how well you’ve narrowed in on some deep well of feeling.</p>
<p>I said I didn’t know how to explain the mental motion, and then this
morning I remembered that I have in fact written about 2/3rds of a draft
explaining part of the key to the mental motion, months ago, and then
never finished it because I lost the thread of the thought and it was
impossible to resume.</p>
<p>Well, this is the notebook, the place for incomplete thoughts and bad
explanations, and there’s enough good in the draft that maybe it will
help someone even as it is.</p>
<h3 id="writing-is">Writing is</h3>
<p>Hey. Hey you. Listen up. You’ve been lied to. But I’m going to tell
you the truth.</p>
<p>Well, no, I’m probably going to lie to you too. But they’ll be
different lies. Maybe between the two lies you’ll figure out a bit of
the truth.</p>
<p>This is a piece in three voices. You probably won’t need me to spell
them out, you should be able to hear them in the writing. You could name
them, if you like. Scholar, poet, bro.</p>
<p>Rude TBH.</p>
<p>But they are all me. I’m just doing an experiment in writing style,
practicing code switching mid thought.</p>
<p>Code switching. Shape shifting. Dancing from form to form as the
thought and the feeling shifts and twists.</p>
<p>Writing is Becoming the writer you need to be In order to write The
words that you need to write</p>
<p>Following where it takes me. Not trying to hide the dance from you.
The whirlwind lurking behind each piece.</p>
<p>You know why I write what I do, right? Because someone has to. This
is no different.</p>
<p>It’s all a dumb trick of course. This piece is no different than any
other. It’s not an escape from style, it’s just another style. More
gimmick than truth. I give it a C-. Cute idea, lousy execution. Stick to
the assignment, kid.</p>
<p>This is unfair of course. At school, assignments where I broke form
usually got an A. Aside from some mutually embarrassing conversations
about unintended sexual connotations, my English teacher rather liked my
poetry. I got an A for a very funny chemistry report.</p>
<p>Oh good, an A. That makes it all better. That’s the lie, right there.
You can’t grade writing. That’s not what it’s for. It’s bullshit.
Writing isn’t there to be assessed, it’s there to get shit done. Nobody
is grading your fucking tweets, and every single one is more useful than
any essay you ever wrote in school. Writing is a way to</p>
<p>Make a connection An intimacy I can’t let you in Can’t show you what
it’s like to be me But maybe I can give you a glimpse? Walk you through
the steps Show you a little of what it’s like.</p>
<p>I tell people that writing is like pulling on the thread of a
thought. This is true. This is a lie.</p>
<p>Writing is like stepping into the water. Sometimes the current is
gentle and you can go where you want. Sometimes a torrent takes you and
you have no choices left.</p>
<p>This isn’t how they tell you it works, of course. Plan, prepare,
edit. Put on a performance for teacher. The things you write for
yourself aren’t “real” writing”, are they?</p>
<p>You can tell they’re not real because nobody is watching you. Grading
you. Telling you your the right sort of person, fitting into the nice
tidy person shaped box they’ve laid out for you. What do you mean, it
doesn’t fit? What, you want special treatment? Fuck you, you’re not
special, you’re not worth it.</p>
<p>You are, of course.</p>
<p>The truth is they don’t know how to teach you to write. Neither do
I.</p>
<p>Perhaps writing is not something you can teach, because all the most
important parts are already there.</p>
<p>All you can do is Show them to the water Invite them in Tell them
you’ve got them It’s safe It’s not real water You can’t drown Though you
won’t always believe this when the current takes you.</p>
<p>We don’t know how to teach writing because writing is everything And
everything can be writing How can you teach everything? We barely know
how to teach something.</p>
<p>Remember when I said there were three voices here? That was a lie of
course. There’s only one voice here. It’s all me.</p>
<p>You can wall off the different parts of you, keep them tidy and
separate.</p>
<p>But there are no walls inside your mind Unless you put them
there.</p>
<p>We learn particular ways of writing designed to please particular
groups of people. Does this sound like a tweet? Does this sound like a
paper? Have you learned to make yourself acceptable to us? How can we
know what to make of you if you do not first make yourself into what we
want you to be? In order to write, you must first decide who to write
for.</p>
<p>Or you can make them By writing for them</p>
<p>You can write within a neat and tidy style, following all the rules.
You should. The rules are an excellent place to learn. A style is where
you learn not what to write but how. By following the rules and learning
what they entail you can learn skills that you could never find left to
your own devices.</p>
<p>But many of the rules you learn are shit. Dry, boring, forms, that do
nothing but make you easy to assess. A great way to make it easy for
someone to see what’s in your head without caring about it. But that
isn’t what writing is for. Writing isn’t how you should what’s in your
head. Writing is how you put new things in other people’s heads. Writing
is</p>
<p>A borderland Where chaos and order meet Where the jumble and swirl of
thoughts inside your head Take shape upon a page Into something that can
live on in others</p>
<p>Writing is Always, ultimately, a way to explain part of yourself to
others. This is how I see the world. This is what I think is important.
This is what I think this is. This is what I see. This is how I
feel.</p>
<p>But it’s cringe, right? Adults don’t write like this. There’s a
reason for that. You left your poetry behind with your teenage years.
Back then you still acted like your feelings mattered. But this wasn’t
how you were supposed to write poetry. It was too raw, too crude. How
could you think your clumsy words on a page could matter to anyone?</p>
<p>Writing is Chasing the leading edge of those feelings And seeing
where they lead you Drawing out a thought Clearing a space into which it
can emerge Surprising even you</p>
<p>Writing is Sitting in front of a page And pouring out words onto it
Fresh from the place where words come from.</p>
<p>Writing is where you make a connection To others To yourself Where
you bring together things that you didn’t know belonged together And
place them upon the page and only then can say “Yes, that’s right.
That’s how it is.”</p>
<p>Good writing matters. It is impossible to write about something that
doesn’t matter to you. Instead you must become a writer to whom it
matters, and write from there. Writing is taking a part of you that
matters and sharing it with others, as a gift.</p>
<p>Or writing is taking a part of you that matters And putting it onto a
page Never to be shown to others, because you are afraid that they might
crush it.</p>
<p>The formal style provides a distance from the writing. You show
yourself, but also hide yourself. You carefully, clinically, talk about
your feelings, but never really show them. You couch your words in an
accent of “well this is just what I think”, or an academic “one” in
which the authorship of the piece is hidden behind a veil of
indirection. No, look elsewhere, not at me. Throwing your passive
voice.</p>
<p>You learned this style as a defence mechanism. It’s terrifying to put
a piece of yourself out into the world and have it judged. We are not
kind to others’ writing. We critique it, we comment on it, we focus on
the wrong parts and take some random detail and tear it to shreds while
the author looks on in horror, crying “No! Listen to what I’m saying.
That’s not what matters here!”.</p>
<p>So we write armoured. We put out these pieces with only the barest
sliver of ourselves, wrapped in so many defences and hedges and
justifications that it was hardly worth writing. “Look at me”, we cry,
“Hear what I’m saying”, behind so many caveats and hedges and with so
little to say that they cannot possibly hear what we’re saying.</p>
<p>Or sometimes we disown the piece. Cast it out into the world in a
manner that indicates we don’t really mean it. “Ha ha, only joking…
unless?”</p>
<p>You can see it here, writing a piece like this required me to add a
whole layer of ironic meta-commentary to make it safe.</p>
<p>No, fuck you, that’s not what this is. This is the lie again. Serious
is not the same as formal.</p>
<p>Writing doesn’t have to be good. It’s not a neat and tidy medium in
which every thought and feeling can be tidily cut and pressed and put on
display. I don’t write in an informal style when I’m not serious, I
write like this when I am so serious I can’t help it. I don’t have the
time or energy to sit down and put things in a nice and tidy format in
which I present all my arguments and put in fancy</p>
<p>Line breaks which somehow break the rhythm in a way that makes it
art. Sometimes I’m just trying to talk to you, and what I want to talk
about is important! Not everything is pretty. Not everything is neat.
Not everything I write is because I have some cleverly packaged idea I
want to communicate to you.</p>
<p>You know what writing is? Writing is pure unbridled rage. A scream at
the world “be different!”. You lower your voice, learn to argue
persuasively, learn to be nice and polite and tidy in a way</p>
<p>(This is where the draft ends, and I don’t intend to finish it)</p>
