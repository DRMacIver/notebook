 <p>
  My brain is currently trying to synthesise some stuff together that I'm not sure I can articulate in less than a Chidi-thesis worth of content and it's very annoying.</p>
 <p>
  The following combine in a way that I have not yet been able to tease out a small t thesis from:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   "The Shock of the Old" - David Edgerton</li>
  <li>
   "Shop Class as Soulcraft" - Matthew Crawford</li>
  <li>
   "The Two Cultures of Mathematics" - Tim Gowers</li>
  <li>
   "Telling is Listening" - Ursula Le Guin</li></ul>
 <p>
  Roughly the area I am attempting to sound out is the idea of knowledge which is embodied in a person or a group, and cannot be separated from that without essentially rebuilding it from scratch (possibly with some gentle editing from a teacher who already understands it).</p>
 <p>
  Physical skills are very much like this (you can't just read a book to learn a martial art), but I think we treat cognitive skills as if they're
  <em>
   not</em>
  like this, when they absolutely are, and we privilege knowledge based on how close it is to the ideal of transmissibility.</p></blockquote>
