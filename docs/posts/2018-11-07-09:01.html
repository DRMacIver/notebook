<p>This book is 80% great and 20% red flags, but that doesn’t mean it
averages out to a book that is merely good, instead it is a great book
that should be consumed well salted.</p>
<p>What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>Well, I really like the conclusions of the book and it has taught me
a number of useful and interesting things, but it is fundamentally
written in a popular science style. This means that its claims are
stated with much higher confidence than I think is warranted, especially
given the replication crisis, and it is often overly credulous about
things outside of the authors’ area of expertise - apparently blockchain
is an amazing technology that is going to change the community of
knowledge, and I nearly permanently put the book down when they started
waxing lyrical about chaos theory and fractals early on. I feel like the
authors should take their own advice and write causal explanations of
the things they are referencing in their book in order to evaluate their
own understanding.</p>
<p>But it’s a <em>really</em> useful framing of how knowledge,
cognition, and understanding work, and I think I would recommend it to
everyone despite the above reservations.</p>
<p>The following are some of the interesting things in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligence is fundamentally <em>action oriented</em> - we are
trying to achieve things, and our ability to reason about things is
largely in support of that goal. As a result we are much better at
causal than logical reasoning.</li>
<li>Cognition is fundamentally <em>embodied</em>. e.g. we don’t actually
catch a baseball by plotting a parabola in our heads, we delegate some
of the computation to our body and the world around us, and use an
adaptive method that involves moving around in a way that adjusts our
position until we catch the ball.</li>
<li>In the same way we delegate our understanding to the environment, we
delegate our understanding to other people. In some sense this is
obvious, because nobody can be an expert in everything, but we greatly
underestimate how much of our thinking process is delegated.</li>
<li>In particular, we suffer from <em>the knowledge illusion</em> that
is the title of the book - we confuse our ability to delegate
understanding to the world or the people around us with the
understanding itself. If we know that we have access to someone who
understands something, or can otherwise acquire the information through
experimentation or reading the internet, we rate our understanding of
the subject more highly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The titular knowledge illusion is probably the main thing that I
didn’t know <em>something</em> about before reading this book, but I
found the rest of it significantly increased my understanding of it. I
think there is a decent chance that I will do a reread and take copious
notes the second time through.</p>
