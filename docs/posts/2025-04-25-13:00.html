<p>Recently, Lisa and I were having a conversation in which I was
struggling to express myself about some things I was feeling, and in the
course of doing so we came to a very useful realisation about a way in
which our internal experiences are quite different, and as a result
something she does in these conversations that would be helpful for her
is unhelpful for me. I suspect variation here is common, and I thought
it would be worth writing it up.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">To be clear, this was a very good conversation and Lisa
was excellent throughout. I’m writing about this because I thought the
difference between us was interesting, not to complain about my partner.
She’s great. A+ grade in this conversation. Would partner again.</span></p>
<p>Specifically… often during emotional conversations I will go <em>very
slow</em>. My sentences will come out haltingly, with long pauses
between words. Lisa will then try to complete these sentences for me.
This is a natural thing to do, and something that it other contexts is
very helpful, but when I’m trying to express something I’m feeling is
actually extremely unhelpful. The particularly surprising thing to her
was that it’s unhelpful <em>even when the completion is
correct</em>.</p>
<p>I think there are two common experiences that this sort of halting
speech looks like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Aphasia, when you’re having a “tip of your tongue” moment and can’t
find the right word.</li>
<li>When you know what you want to say but are scared to say it, or
can’t find a tactful way to say it, or are in some other ways inhibited
from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>In these two cases, which I do experience, someone completing my
sentence for me is quite helpful.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Actually, I sortof don’t like it when people do this
when I’m having aphasia. Lisa used the analogy of “Is it like how tying
a child’s shoes for them after they should be able to do it for themself
stops them figuring it out?”. And for the main thing I want to talk
about, it’s not like that, but for aphasia it actually is. Completing my
sentence for me when I’m having aphasia stops me from finding the right
route through my memory to the word. But <em>in the moment</em> it’s
still very helpful.</span> I’m trying to
communicate a specific thing, and the other person being able to fill it
in is very helpful.</p>
