<p>NB this is a very <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up">working
with the garage door up</a> post. Sometimes you just get a sense that
there’s a there there, but you’re not quite sure what it is yet. This
post is an attempt to gesture vaguely in the sense of the there that may
or may not be there. It probably won’t quite make sense yet, because it
doesn’t yet make sense to <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>Plus a lot of general background stuff beyond that. You don’t have to
read any of these to understand this post (I hope), but they vaguely are
defining the cluster of what I’m thinking about right now. Also I can’t
promise that this post will make sense if you <em>have</em> read
them.</p>
<p>Against the Grain talks about the idea of a <em>domus</em>. The term
comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus">the Latin word
meaning home</a>, but can more broadly be used to refer to a freeholding
and its surrounding cultivation. It is the origin of “domestication”,
which can be thought of as the process of taking other species and
making them suitable for inclusion in the domus.</p>
<p>Because not enough people write like mathematicians, Scott never
really precisely defines what he <em>means</em> by domus in any easy to
extract form, but the condensation of it in <a href="https://proteviblog.typepad.com/files/notes-on-scott-against-the-grain.pdf">these
notes</a> is pretty good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “domus” is an assemblage, or concatenation of multiple species
and environmental features – landscape changes, animal pens, houses,
butcher shops, blacksmiths, marketplaces and so on – that are put
together in varying proportions. It is multi-dimensional long-term
inherited niche construction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Scott talks more broadly about the <em>domus complex</em> as the
effect of humanity on the landscape. We don’t just produce small,
tightly concentrated, domestic units, but we broadly reshape the
landscape around us, and have been doing so long before anything
recognisable as modern agriculture.</p>
<p>Within this broader domus complex, the domus is more like a local
increase in concentration of domestication, but the the domestication of
the landscape extends out far beyond where you might naturally think of
as being the boundary of human presence. The village is domesticated,
certainly, but so are the forests around it where humans hunt, and
possibly clear with fire, so are the places where evolution is shaped by
human predation, or by escaped domesticated species (plant and
animal).</p>
<p>And it is not just the rest of the world that is shaped by
domestication, but also humanity. In one sense, humanity has shaped
grain to serve us. In another sense, grain has shaped humanity to
propagate itself. The situation is even more murky when you look at a
species like dogs, who we essentially co-evolved with to domesticate
each other.</p>
<p>I have <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1126046264125267968">previously
argued</a> that you can look at books in the same way as grain: In one
sense we create books to serve us, but in another sense books are best
seen as a replicator in their own right, using humanity as the
background medium of replication.</p>
<p>One could look at a kind of generalised definition of a domus as
this: A domus is a set of tightly co-evolved replicators, each of which
are dependent on each other and the domus as a whole as a platform
driving their success, and which would be significantly altered (and
possibly fail entirely) by its removal from the domus.</p>
<p>Books in the absence of humanity cannot replicate. Grain in the
absence of humanity is much more subject to the vagaries of weeds, and
drought. Humanity in the absence of books would find itself at a
significant disadvantage compared to where we are today. Humanity in the
absence of grain would starve.</p>
<p>As with Scott’s domus complex, the boundary of a generalised domus
will usually be fuzzy. There will be things that are obviously in a
domus together, and things that are obviously not in a domus together,
and a wide range in between. There will also likely tend to be
overlapping domus which do not themselves necessarily constitute a
larger domus. For example, both a large international business’s culture
and a city’s culture might usefully be considered as domus in their own
right, but are not usefully considered as a single unified domus even
when the business has an office in that city - although the two domus
interact, they do not interact densely enough to be usefully considered
as part of the same domus.</p>
<p>This density of interaction is key to whether it is useful to think
of a set of replicators as a domus. Replicators in a domus will create
pressure on each other to become more usable to them, by “offering”
services. Books create a culture of literacy by turning humans into
readers. Grains create a culture of mass agriculture by turning humans
into states.</p>
<p>In “Sorting Things Out”, Bowker and Star introduce the idea of
<em>torque</em>, the twisting of time lines created by people and
categorisation systems on each other: When a person interacts with a
categorisation, this creates pressure on both the person (to conform)
and the categorisation system (to include the person). People’s
behaviour and categorisation systems are both examples of replicators
(they literally evolve over time, in response to replication with
variation and selection), and the torque between these replicators as
they interact is the process of each making the other more usable to
each other. Mutual torque</p>
<p>So, generalising this, we might say that <em>torque</em> is the
influence between two replicators to make each other more usable to each
other. A domus is thus a set of replicators that exert significant
torque on each other, thereby domesticating each other. Torque creates
domestication.</p>
<p>“Where Good Ideas Come From” is a book largely about treating
innovation as an evolutionary process (It’s not especially convincingly
argued, but that’s OK for me because I was already on board with most of
its ideas and it was nice to see them sketched out a bit more). In it he
describes the idea of a <em>platform</em> - an ecosystem that
essentially acts as a foundation for other things to develop on top of
them. Two examples he gives of such platforms are how coral reefs create
atolls, which are highly nutrient dense environments supporting a huge
amount of diversity of life, and cities, which have the same function
for memetic diversity.</p>
<p>In “The Economy of Cities”, Jane Jacobs talks about how cities are
essentially the driver of innovation. She also talks about how cities
predate agriculture, which I think “Against the Grain” convincingly
disproves (depending on what you “count” as agriculture), but I think
her broader point is still sound if you replace “city” with “domus”,
because there really isn’t a city / not-city binary. Instead a better
reading of this would be that <em>domus density</em> is a huge driver of
evolutionary diversity. Any domus serves as a platform, both for the
replicators currently in it and for new ones to be brought into the
fold.</p>
<p>Jacobs talks about “import replacement”, where a city starts
producing goods it has previously imported, as a driver of city group.
In a domus sense this also occurs as something we might call
<em>replicator integration</em>. Once, cats were not part of the domus.
Then they started essentially feeding off it (by eating creatures that
were parasitizing off the domus). Now cats are a thoroughly integrated
part of humanity’s domus complex.</p>
<p>The main human domus complex inextricably contains memes (in the
original Dawkins sense. Pictures with text on them are less load bearing
although still a major feature) - ideas and complexes of ideas which
replicate themselves by spreading from person to person. The memetic
domus in the title of this post is really just the part of that broader
domus that centers on these memetic replicators. It’s not necessarily
cleanly separable from the rest of the human domus complex, but it’s
worth considering as an object of study in its own right.</p>
<p>One way in which it is worth studying is cultural. As I wrote before,
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">culture
is deeply contingent</a>. Here the memes that we are interested in are
particularly <em>behaviours</em>. When you have a domus, people interact
often enough and exert enough torque on each other, than where it is
useful to synchronise behaviours to be the same, they generally will.
Whenever there is a coordination problem, a domus will tend to create
homogoneity through torque.</p>
<p>A domus will also tend to use that torque to resist change. If two
previously unlinked domuses start interacting, each will induce torque
on the behaviours of the other, but because changing one replicator
within a domus will cause it to be less useful to the others, the
within-domus torque will tend to be greater than the between-domus
torque. If interactions are common enough, the two domus might
eventually “merge”, and eventually the within-domus torque might be
enough to eventually remove the inhomogeneity, but without that the two
will tend to remain separate.</p>
<p>A particularly important feature of this when the domus contains
humans (technically “human behaviours” as humans don’t have to be
present in their capacity as replicators for this to be relevant) is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html">legibility</a>
within the domus. Because of this homogenising effect, two people within
the same domus will tend to make more sense to each other than people
from other domus - many core assumptions about behaviour and
communication will be shared and not need explaining, and many
shorthands will have been developed that are useful for describing
behaviour within the domus. These shorthands will be shared.</p>
<p>This shared legibility is related to something that Kenneth Arrow
talks about in “the limits of organization”. This is a book about why,
if we assume that the price system is very good (which it mostly is, and
as an economist Kenneth Arrow is particularly predisposed to believe
that it is), why do non-market organisations form? One of the answers he
presents to this is that organisations exist to lower communication
costs within the organisation, which enables people to acquire
information that is valuable but not worth the cost of acquiring it in a
broader market economy. Thus by forming an organisation in which
communication is cheaper, a number of market failures become
soluble.</p>
<p>The mutual legibility within the domus serves a similar function.
People will find it easier to communicate with each other, and so many
ideas become possible to spread that would not in isolation.
Essentially, the domus becomes a platform for a much richer memetic
ecosystem that would not be possible without it.</p>
<p>One example of a set of replicators that it is useful to think of as
part of a memetic domus is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-18-12:24.html">the
libraries of Pierre Bayard</a>, consisting of various types of books,
both literal and figurative, and the collective discussions we have
centered around them.</p>
<p>This is all now quite far from the thought process that spawned this
post, and I think I will let these ideas bed down a bit more and try to
explain it more coherently and go into this thought process a bit more
in a later post, but to touch on it briefly: It is useful to think of
yourself as embedded in a domus with your own surrounding information
architecture (your “exobrain” as I’d often think of it), and it’s worth
thinking about behaviours in terms of promoting the health of that
domus.</p>
<p>For example my own personal memetic domus (something to make me
share, something to make me like and subscribe) might contain:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The thoughts I have</li>
<li>The conversations I have</li>
<li>Posts on this notebook</li>
<li>Tweets</li>
<li>Books I read</li>
</ol>
<p>It may not seem natural to think of these all as replicators, and
some of them are a bit of a stretch I’ll grant, but they definitely all
exert torque on each other.</p>
<p>The domus forms a platform largely to the degree that it is well
connected through torque, so behaviours which <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-09:44.html">promote
the formation of ideas</a> will largely be ones that increase torque
within your personal memetic domus.</p>
<p>An example of this, which is largely what prompted this very post, is
that I’ve taken to dipping in and out of books and rereading bits of
them to remind me of their contents. This has created significantly
higher torque between thoughts and books, and (indirectly) between books
and this very notebook.</p>
