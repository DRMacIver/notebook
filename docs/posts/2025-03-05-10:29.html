<p>There are a number of basic conditional probability problems that
seem counter-intuitive but become intuitive with an extremely basic
technique.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">So basic that it’s almost embarrassing to describe it as
a technique to be honest, but then I see people getting confused on
problems trivially solvable by it and think it probably warrants that
label after all.</span> I thought it would be worth
explaining this technique, as I think it’s both a good tool to have in
your toolkit explicitly, and is potentially a good route in for teaching
people to reason about probability.</p>
<p>The technique is “world counting”. You enumerate all the possible
versions of the world, cross out any ones that have been ruled out by
evidence, and then work out what fraction of the worlds remaining have
the property of interest.</p>
<p>For example, say I roll two dice, and tell you only that I rolled a
sum of 8 or more. What is the probability that at least one of those
rolls was a 6?</p>
<p>First, we enumerate all the possible rolls: 1/1, 1/2, …, 2/1, …,
6/6.</p>
<p>Now, we cut out all of the ones where the sum is less than 8, and get
the following combinations remaining: 2/6, 3/5, 3/6, 4/4, 4/5, 4/6, 5/3,
5/4, 5/5, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/5, 6/6</p>
<p>That gives us 15 worlds, of which 9 have a 6 in them, so the
probability of a 6 is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{9}{15} =
0.6\)</span>.</p>
<p>This works well with the dice example, but we run into a wrinkle with
a slightly more complicated one.</p>
<p>Consider the following problem: I flip a coin. If it shows heads, I
flip it again. If it shows tails, I don’t.</p>
<p>This gives us three worlds: HH, HT, T. Two where I got heads the
first time, one where I got tails the second time.</p>
<p>Now, what is the probability of getting heads on the first toss? It’s
half, obviously, but the world enumeration approach as I’ve described it
so far gives <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span> because
there are twice as many worlds with heads as tails. This is clearly
wrong.</p>
<p>One way to fix this is to imagine that we flip the second coin
regardless but that flip is only “visible” if we got heads on the first
flip. This gives us the worlds HH, HT, TH, TT, where to the observer TH
and TT look identical, and we recover the right probability (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>). This feels a little
convoluted though.</p>
<p>The real problem here is that the world counting method I described
only works for situations where every world is equally likely, and in
this case that’s not true. The T world is twice as likely as either the
HT or the HH worlds.</p>
<p>So, let’s generalise the technique slightly: A <em>weighted world
enumeration</em> is a non-empty list of possible worlds together with
some non-zero weight associated with each of them. In order to calculate
the probability of something, you add up the weight of the worlds in
which it’s true, and divide by the total weight of the worlds.</p>
<p>Now, the question is… how do you get weighted world enumerations?</p>
<p>You build them as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You start from a basic enumeration which is just a single world in
which anything could happen, and some arbitrary weight (it doesn’t
matter what. Conventionally it would be 1, but you can pick this for
convenience)</li>
<li>You can at any point split a world into one or more subworlds which
are mutually incompatible. e.g. if I flip a coin, you could split the
world into the subworlds where it comes up heads and the subworlds that
it comes up tails. The weights you assign to those subworlds can be
whatever you like, as long as they add up to the weight of the original
world. If you think of the subworlds as equally likely you should split
the weight between them evenly.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Note that you’re allowed to throw away possibilities
when you do this split. e.g. if you believe that something is a
necessary consequence of one of your worlds, you can replace it with
some more specialised condition without changing the weights.</span></li>
<li>To get a conditional weighted world enumeration (i.e. the world
enumeration you want after observing something that rules out some of
the worlds), you just remove everything from the list that has been
ruled out.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, with our two coins example,</p>
<p>Here’s the problem where I first realised quite how useful this
technique is:<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Paraphrased from <a href="https://x.com/julianboolean_/status/1836867126360944873">this
tweet</a>. In the original form it asks whether the probability that
there’s a ball under the cup has gone up or down, and this doesn’t
actually require you to calculate the probability, because of an
interesting general principle: If <span class="math inline">\(A,
B\)</span> are disjoint events with non-zero probabilities of occurring,
then necessarily <span class="math inline">\(P(A | \neg B) &gt;
P(A)\)</span>.</span></p>
<p>There are 10 opaque cups face down on a table. I flipped a fair coin,
if it was heads I picked 1 cup uniformly at random and placed a ball
under it.</p>
<p>You flip the first 9 cups. No ball.</p>
<p>What is the probability that there’s a ball under cup 10?</p>
<p>We can build up our world enumeration as follows:</p>
<p>First, for convenience, pick the initial weight to be 20.</p>
<p>Now, split this into two worlds based on the flip of a coin. Our
world enumeration is now (H, 10), (T, 10). Half the world weight goes to
each coin flip.</p>
<p>If we picked heads, we now pick a cup at random. This splits the H
world into the 10 possible subworlds, one for each cup. So now we have
(T, 10), (H1, 1), (H2, 1), …, (H10, 1).</p>
<p>Now, we want our conditional world enumeration, which has determined
that there is no ball in the first 9 cups. This removes all the worlds
in which we placed a ball there, so now our world enumeration is (T,
10), (H10, 1).</p>
<p>This means that the probability that the ball is in the 10th cup is
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{10 + 1} = \frac{1}{11}\)</span>,
because the total weight of the worlds remaining is <span class="math inline">\(11\)</span> and of that weight, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> of it has the ball there.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">So to answer the original question, it goes up, because
the original probability before revealing those balls is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{20}\)</span>.</span></p>
<p>I think this approach is also useful for reasoning about the dreaded
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Monty Hall
problem</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you’re on a game show, and you’re given the choice of three
doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a
door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what’s behind the doors, opens
another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, “Do you
want to pick door No. 2?” Is it to your advantage to switch your
choice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We start with our initial world, which we’ll give weight 1 out of
convention, and split it three ways based on which door has a car behind
it: 1, 2, 3. We believe these to be equally likely<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">If we didn’t believe that we could in our head shuffle
the doors and relabel them to make this the case.</span>, so
give them each weight <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{3}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Monty then picks a door, 2 or 3. This gives us 6 theoretically
possible worlds. 12, 13, 22, 23, 32, 33.</p>
<p>Now, we know that Monty knows which door the car is behind, and thus
presumably is deliberately picking a door which doesn’t have a car. This
means that the worlds 22 and 33 are actually impossible, because Monte
will never pick that door. Thus our actual list is 12, 13, 23, 32.</p>
<p>The worlds in which it’s an advantage to us to switch are 23 and 32,
so to calculate how likely it is for switching to be good we need to
know their total weight. We don’t know the weights of 12, 13, but we do
know that the total weight stayed unchanged (as we’ve not removed any
possible worlds, only impossible ones that we’d have had to assign
weight zero to), so the total weight is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and the probability that switching is
good for us is the sum of the weights of worlds 23 and 32, which is
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\)</span>. So switching is good
most of the time.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to compare this to the version in which Monty
doesn’t know which door has the car behind it and picks randomly (with
you just losing immediately if he picks a car). We now have all six of
our possible worlds 12, 13, 22, 23, 32, 33, with each of these having an
equal weight of <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{6}\)</span>. Now,
we’ve observed a goat, which cuts out the worlds 22 and 33, so now we’ve
got worlds 12, 13, 23, 32. But this time all of these have equal weight,
so switching is to our advantage with probabilityh <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, and there is no benefit (or
disadvantage) to switching.</p>
<p>You can extend this technique to general Bayesian reasoning, which is
essentially a modification where rather than cutting out worlds that are
impossible you reweight them based on how likely they are to show the
relevant data, but that’s a topic for another time.</p>
