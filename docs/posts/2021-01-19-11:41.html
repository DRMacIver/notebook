<p>There’s a bunch of test-case reduction theory that mostly lives in my
head and currently-abandoned paper drafts. I’m doing a week of PhD
related writing so I thought it would be good to write up a dump of
these ideas here.</p>
<p>A test-case reducer is something that is designed to take an
interesting test case and make it “simpler” in some sense while
retaining the property of interest.</p>
<p>Formally, a test-case reducer on some set of test-cases <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a function <span class="math inline">\(\{r : \{(U, x) : x \in U \subseteq T\} \to
T\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(r(U, x) \in U\)</span>.
The set <span class="math inline">\(\{(U, x) : x \in U \subseteq
T\}\)</span> is called the set of reduction problems on <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>.</p>
<p>The first argument to the reducer is the interestingness test (the
set of interesting test cases) and the second is some interesting test
case that we want to reduce.</p>
<p>A partial order <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span> is a
reduction order for <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a reducer for <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span>) if <span class="math inline">\(r(U, x) \preceq x\)</span>. The reduction order
captures what we mean by saying that a reducer makes the test case
“simpler”. A test case is simpler if it’s smaller in the reduction
order.</p>
<p>(It’s hopefully faily uncontroversial that the “simpler” relationship
should be a partial order - it’s basically to avoid cycles where
sometimes <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> and sometimes <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> depending on the interestingness test.
It’s easy to construct reducers that do have these cycles, so not every
reducer has a reduction order, but generally I think those reducers are
badly designed)</p>
<p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-01-01-11:22.html">Basic
Reducer Design</a> I generally prefer the reduction order to be a total
order. There’s no reason it has to be, but there’s also no reason for it
not to be - any partial order can be extended to a total order, and if a
function is a reducer for some partial order then it’s a reducer for any
extension of it.</p>
<p>One reason to prefer a total order is that if we want a test-case
reducer to be normalizing (in the sense Groce et al. propose in <a href="https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~adg326/issta17.pdf">One test to rule
them all</a>, that is its output does not depend on the initial test
case) then it must be a total order because for any <span class="math inline">\(x, y\)</span> we must have <span class="math inline">\(r(\{x, y\}, \cdot) = y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(r(\{x, y\}, \cdot) = x\)</span>, so either <span class="math inline">\(x \preceq y\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(y \preceq x\)</span>.</p>
<p>One nice thing about reduction orders is that they guarantee that
reducers compose nicely without undoing each other’s work. Given
reducers <span class="math inline">\(r_1, r_2\)</span> we can define a
composite reducer straightforwardly as <span class="math inline">\((r_1
\cdot r_2)(U, x) = r_1(U, r_2(U, x))\)</span> - we apply <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> then we apply <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span> is a reduction order for both of
<span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> then it also is for <span class="math inline">\(r_1 \cdot r_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Without that common reduction order, you might end up in an annoying
situation where <span class="math inline">\(r_2(U, x) = y\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(r_1(U, y) = x\)</span>. Note that you can
have this even if <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> each have a reduction order but it’s
not the same one.</p>
<p>One thing to consider is when a reducer is “done”. We say a reduction
problem <span class="math inline">\((U, x)\)</span> is fully reduced for
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(r(U, x) = x\)</span>, and a reducer is idempotent
if <span class="math inline">\((U, r(U, x))\)</span> is fully reduced -
i.e. running the reducer twice doesn’t do any more than running the
reducer once.</p>
<p>Another nice feature of reduction orders is that they guarantee that
you can always iterate a reducer to an idempotent fixed point (assuming
the reduction order is reasonable. The technical condition we require
here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation">well-foundedness</a>
but in basically every case of interest the order has the much stronger
property that <span class="math inline">\(\{y: y \preceq x\}\)</span> is
finite for any <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>). Given a reducer
<span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> you can define the reducer <span class="math inline">\(r^+\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(r^+(U, x)\)</span> is defined by iterating the
sequence <span class="math inline">\(x_0 = x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x_{n + 1} = r(U, x_n)\)</span> until you reach a
fixed point. Without a reduction order you can get cycles in this
sequence so it may never terminate.</p>
<p>You can also think of <span class="math inline">\(r^+\)</span> as the
fixed point of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> under composition.
i.e. <span class="math inline">\(r^+ = r \cdot r^+\)</span>, so we call
<span class="math inline">\(r^+\)</span> the <em>fixation</em> of <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
<p>By the way, these two constructs of reducer composition and fixation
are not particularly abstract but are actually how reducers are built in
practice. You can think of your typical reducer as <span class="math inline">\((r_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot r_n\)</span>^+$ where the
<span class="math inline">\(r_i\)</span> are individual simpler reducers
that are typically called <em>reduction passes</em>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking for a reducer we’re most interested in the
behaviour of <span class="math inline">\(r^+\)</span> - what happens
when you run the reducer to fixation - but it’s often useful to consider
reducers that are not necessarily run to fixation because of this pass
structure. Anecdotally (and for solid heuristic reasons) it’s generally
better <em>not</em> to run each pass to fixation before running the next
one: After running a reducer once it’s typically “pretty close” to
fixation, and running it again is likely to be wasted effort, while if
other passes have run it may have been perturbed enough that more work
is useful.</p>
<p>Reasoning in terms of the fully reduced problems of a reducer also
gives us another useful notion, which is that of reducer strength. We
can say <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> is at least as strong
as <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> if every reduction problem
that is fully reduced for <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> is
also fully reduced for <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> (and
stronger if also there are some reduction problems that are fully
reduced for <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> that are not for
<span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span>).</p>
<p>This is a slightly weaker notion of strength than some we might
consider. It’s possible for <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> to
be stronger than <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span> but to
sometimes have <span class="math inline">\(r_2(U, x) \prec r_1(U,
x)\)</span>, because <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> took a
path that causes it to get stuck at a worse point.</p>
<p>Under this notion of strength, <span class="math inline">\(r_1 \cdot
r_2\)</span> is at least as strong as each of <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(r^+\)</span> is equally strong to <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>.</p>
