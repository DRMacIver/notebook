<p>We went out scrumping for drones earlier, and in the course of doing so I did something weird: I brought a mug of coffee with me.</p>
<p>This was weird not because I had coffee with me, that's normal, but because it was a normal ceramic mug that I was just wandering through the streets holding.</p>
<p>If it had been a paper cup that would have been fine, obviously. Similarly, a travel mug wouldn't have raised an eyebrow.
But a normal ceramic mug? That's weird.</p>
<p>Why was I carrying a mug? Well, I wasn't going far - the drone tree was only about five minutes walk away - and I didn't have a travel mug, but I'd just made coffee and I wanted to drink my coffee. Sure, I might drop it, but the solution to that was to not drop it (I didn't drop it).</p>
<p>It was a perfectly reasonable practical solution, but ceramic mugs are a home item not a travel item, so it was weird.</p>
<p>Bernard Suits defines a game as "the voluntary attempt to overcome unecessary obstacles", and I think about that a lot.</p>
<p>How voluntary does it have to be? </p>
<p>Clearly it's still a game if you give in to social pressure to play it, right? The fact that your family will sulk at you if you don't play doesn't make Yahtzee suddenyl not a game (admittedly I could argue that it's not a game for other reasons, but it's certainly a Suitsian game in the sense that you're attempting to overcome your desire to die of boredom and the whole thing seems very unecessary. Also there are dice).</p>
<p>But who determines what's necessary?</p>
<p>More properly, the above his portable definition. He actually defines a game as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He offers the example of mountain climbing: Your prelusory goal is to get to the top of the mountain, but the lusory means are that you have to climb it. If you could just take a helicopter up, you would not be playing the "game" of mountain climbing.</p>
<p>Here's what I wonder: How much of our behaviour is governed by things that are, effectively, constitutive rules of a social game? I was certainly refusing to follow voluntarily adopted rules that prohibited me from using the more efficient means that I was currently employing. Those rules are, in some sense, accepted just because they make possible the activity of society.</p>
<p>In carrying a ceramic mug around with me outside was I, in small part, refusing to play a game in which everyone is implicitly participating in all the time?
Maybe, but at least I got to drink my coffee.</p>
<p>We didn't manage to scrump any drones, incidentally.</p>
