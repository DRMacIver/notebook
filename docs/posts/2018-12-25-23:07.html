<p>I would describe this book as "good but not great", which is a shame because a lot about it is very good.
This is a powerfully written book about the (black) author's experiences travelling around the south and learning about his ancestry.
I learned a bunch of interesting and important details about:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/09/the-question-of-cultural-appropriation">cultural exploitation</a> of African American cuisine.</li>
<li>some of the ways in which food has been intensely political, especially in the USA's history of enslavement.</li>
<li>the important cultural role food has played in people hanging on to their history.</li>
<li>the difficulty of retracing your lineage and history when much of it has been forcibly destroyed by slavery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, <em>most</em> of what I learned was details. The book meanders quite a lot, with very little in the way of unifying direction or synthesis,
and often repeats itself.
It felt more like a collection of essays that had loosely been edited together into a book, without any attempt to really tie them together or unify their content.</p>
<p>This would be fine in principle, except the book is quite long.
The length is not in and of itself unwarranted - I would certainly have happily read a book of the same length on the same subject if I felt the length was well used - but it made me significantly more impatient with its structural flaws,
and the result is a book that is locally very well written but globally fails to hold together, and as a result by the end of the book I was mostly impatient for it to be over despite mostly liking it.</p>
<p>I don't regret reading it, and I'm going to keep it around for a bit (mostly to try out a few of the recipes that are sprinkled throughout it), but I don't feel like I can really recommend it to anyone whose reading time or rate are more constrained than mine.</p>
