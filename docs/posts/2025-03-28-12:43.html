<p>In a flat I shared a while back, for some reason we owned a wooden
meat tenderising mallet.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Disgusting object. Can’t recommend.</span> One of my flatmates was the main
person who used it, so I assume it was hers, but it lived with all of
the other kitchen utensils.</p>
<p>One day I discovered it had been put away still covered in bits of
raw chicken. I politely expressed some disapproval of this fact.</p>
<p>She seemed vaguely baffled by this objection. I don’t remember her
exact words, but it was something to the tune of “I did wash it! But
it’s hard to clean”.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">As a side note, I should observe that this was a long
time ago. I no longer live with her but we’re still in touch and I
believe she has become a vastly cleaner person in more recent years. I
also very much enjoyed living with her at the time despite these
foibles. This is not a story about how terrible she was as a flatmate.</span> I, in turn, expressed the sentiment
that if something is hard to clean then that means you <em>clean it more
thoroughly</em>, or don’t use it, but that putting things away with raw
meat stuck to them was not among the acceptable set of outcomes.</p>
<p>She did rewash it, but I’m not sure my point really stuck.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Unlike the chicken.</span></p>
<p>I’ve thought about this example over and over again since then, in
various shared living situations, because I’ve run into a surprising
number of people who are bad at washing up in a particular way: It’s not
that they’re incompetent at the basic mechanical actions of washing up<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Although to some degree they probably are this too,
because they lack a basic feedback mechanism required to get good at
it.</span>, but that they <em>don’t check if
the thing they’ve washed up is clean afterwards</em>, and as a result a
substantial fraction of things they wash up still have food stuck to
them. It’s usually not as bad as the raw chicken incident, but it’s bad
enough that I don’t consider the things they washed up to be clean
enough to put away without double checking.</p>
<p>As a result, I typically ended up rewashing stuff they’ve washed,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Depending on how bitchy I’m feeling sometimes I’d get
them to do it instead, but that’s often more stressful than doing it
myself. This is not a good strategy and I don’t endorse it, but it is
the one I tend to follow.</span> which means they’ve put in a bunch
of work for literally zero effect, and made me more annoyed at them than
I would be if they hadn’t done anything at all.</p>
<p>Similarly, back when I used to work in more end-user-facing software
with an actual web interface and such,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is less necessary with library code because the
code is the user interface and you can see it being used in the tests.</span>, I
used to deploy this really exciting magical code review technique that
reliably found problems with people’s pull requests: I checked out the
branch, launched the web application, and tried actually using the
feature. Often it had obvious problems.</p>
<p>This has become something of a bugbear of mine in general: People
doing things as if the thing itself was the point, rather than a tool
you are using to achieve a specific outcome, and not thinking about
whether their actions will actually in any way help them achieve their
goal. The result of this is often that they put in about 90% of the
effort required to do it properly, and get 0% of the actual benefit
because what they did didn’t actually work.</p>
<p>The easiest way to fix this is to <em>check whether what you did
worked</em> after doing it. Initially, this will slow you down a bit and
add delays, but as you get good at it you will basically internalise the
process and it doesn’t slow you down much.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Except in the sense that sometimes you’ll find problems
and have to fix them.</span> I
do, however, suspect that in many of these cases the actual thing you
need to do to fix this is to become someone who actually cares about the
end result rather than just wanting to avoid being blamed for not doing
the thing and hoping nobody will notice.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Bad news! I will notice. Yes, including that time you
thought you got away with it.</span></p>
<p>This is also important because there are many examples where you
can’t really check if it worked. For example, I still semi-often see
people wearing face masks in public. I rarely do these days, but
consider this a completely reasonable choice. Unless, that is, you’re
wearing your facemask pulled down so it doesn’t cover your nose. In
which case <em>what on earth are you doing?</em> How have you made it to
2025 without looking up basic mask usage? But you’re never going to
figure out that you did this wrong by checking. What are you going to
check? Did I get a virus Y/N? That’s an incredibly noisy signal, and
tracing it back to the specific error you made is going to be almost
impossible. The only way to get this right is to actually care about
getting things right and then take whatever action is appropriate for
achieving this.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, I’m not claiming I always succeed. Sometimes I’m
rushing and forget to check something. Sometimes I check something
insufficiently carefully. Sometimes I check something and misinterpret
it, or otherwise make a stupid error. I’m not saying I’m perfect, I’m
not asking you or anyone else to be perfect.</p>
<p>But I am asking you to care about succeeding, and when you are
failing, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-25-20:16.html">try to
figure out why and do better</a>.</p>
