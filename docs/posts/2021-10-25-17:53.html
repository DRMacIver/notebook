<p>Random book prompt, from page 54 of John Moreall’s “Comic
Relief”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, the natural setting for humor, as for play generally, is a
group, not an individual. Kierkegaard asked a friend, “Answer me
honestly … do you really laugh when you are alone?” He concluded that
you have to be “a little more than queer” if you do. According to Henri
Bergson, “You would hardly appreciate the comic if you felt yourself
isolated from others. Laughter appears to stand in need of an echo.”</p>
<p>It’s hard to get into the play mode by oneself. Often when I
expereince events alone, especially those involving setbacks, I don’t
see the humor in them until I am later describing them to other people.
And even if I expereince an event as funny while I’m by myself, it’s
unlikely that I’ll enjoy it <em>as much</em> as when I later share it in
conversation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps I’m a little more than queer (I’m certainly more than a
little queer), but I don’t believe this at all. I think laughing on your
own is normal and Kierkegaard needed to read funnier books.</p>
<p>In fact I think I am likely to laugh much harder on my own than in
company.</p>
<p>For example, the hardest I’ve laughed recently was at the following
image:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/saleemrash1d/status/1451195339084492801">From
this tweet</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t know why I find this as funny as I do. It’s objectively very
funny, but also I laughed to the point of struggling to breathe for
nearly a minute. I was on my own.</p>
<p>I’ve similarly been in hysterics reading a Terry Pratchett novel, to
a degree that I wouldn’t normally in company.</p>
<p>In contrast, watching comedy, or having a funny conversation with a
friend or partner, I will laugh regularly, but rarely to that level of
intensity.</p>
<p>It does happen. My sister, L, and I have been known to trigger this
in each other.</p>
<p>For example, a few years ago, she and I were sitting in the kitchen
at my parents’ place in the lead up to Christmas, having a long
conversation. At some point the conversation was talking about how
annoying it was that we’d both inherited the genes from my mother’s side
of the family that makes it very easy for us to put on weight (my
brother is, in comparison to us, very skinny), and that we’d both like
to be a bit lighter than we were.</p>
<p>At some point in this conversation, we looked down at our shared
task, and our hands that were just absolutely <em>covered</em> in
chocolate from the brandy truffles that we were making (My grandmother’s
recipe. It’s like <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-14-11:44.html">processing
redcurrants</a> but more delicious) and simultaneously cracked up.</p>
<p>L and I have done this a few times. There was a soup conversation
that did it too, but you had to be there for that one to be even
slightly funny.</p>
<p>It’s fairly rare for me to be able to do this with someone (I think
all my examples of this happening are family or romantic partners), and
I think the reason is that in order to achieve this you have to have a
fairly large degree of comfort and synchronicity with the other person
or people, and even with such people it’s not the norm unless you’re
currently <em>very</em> in synch.</p>
<p>What happens instead seems to be that although you don’t laugh as
hard in company, you laugh more easily.</p>
<p>Social laughter seems to obey a very simple rule which explains both
these things: You should be laughing about the same amount as everyone
else.</p>
<p>As a result, laughter in a group follows a rise and a fall, where
some people “seed” the laughter, and it rises, bringing everyone along
with them for a bit, and then as people stop laughing it brings the
overall level down and people follow, everyone dynamically adjusting
their level of laughter to be not too far from the overall average.</p>
<p>As a result, you tend not to laugh too intensely unless everyone is
in synch, because you have to raise your intensity at a rate everyone
will follow, but also you tend to laugh more easily because once someone
starts laughing probably so does everybody else.</p>
