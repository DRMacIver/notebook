<p>One of the things I miss about not being able to eat wheat and dairy is pancakes.
I'm currently experimenting with fixing this.</p>
<p>The main thing I've learned is that potato starch works <em>really</em> well as a flour substitute for this, to the point where I almost prefer it to real flour.
Unfortunately I haven't yet figured out how to make pancakes without dairy that taste normal and aren't a bit boring. The baseline is fine but a bit bland.</p>
<p>This was an attempt to pull the pancakes slightly in the direction of more conventional potato pancakes flavour wise. I would describe it as "worked pretty well but needs work".</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup potato starch</li>
<li>6 rashers unsoked bacon</li>
<li>1 medium onion</li>
<li>3 medium duck eggs</li>
<li>\(\frac{1}{2}\) tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
<li>\(\frac{1}{2}\) tsp cream of tartar</li>
<li>lots of sunflower oil</li>
<li>lots of black pepper</li>
</ul>
<p>Preparation steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dice the onion and chop up the bacon. Fry it in oil until browned.</li>
<li>Put everything in a food processor and blend until smooth</li>
<li>Add more oil to the pan, spoon pancake mix into it, and fry. Flip over a couple of times.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike my normal pancake recipe, using potato flour seems to demand a fairly well oiled pan and a much higher heat.</p>
<p>Things I would change next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>I think the addition of the bacon was a mistake. It might work well <em>with</em> bacon, but it's a bit weird in the pancakes.</li>
<li>More rising agent</li>
<li>Less black pepper</li>
</ul>
