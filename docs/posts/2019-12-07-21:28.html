<p>A set <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq N\)</span> is
recursively enumerable if it can be enumerated by a computable function
(formally, if there is some turing machine that halts on an input if and
only if it’s in the set). If an infinite set contains no infinite
recursively enumerable subsets, it is called immune. I was introduced to
this concept by <a href="https://twitter.com/gfredericks_/status/1203345019115053056">Gary
Fredericks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An “immune set” is an infinite set of natural numbers of which no
computer program can print out any infinite subset.</p>
<p>The fact that they “exist” at all is pretty weird.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact they are not weird, they are normal. Almost every infinite
subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is immune.</p>
<p>To see this, consider the set <span class="math inline">\(C = \{0,
1\}^\mathbb{N}\)</span>. This can be mapped to the power set of the
natural numbers by mapping a set to its indicator function <span class="math inline">\(1_A\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(1_A(x) = 1\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(x \in A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. Every <span class="math inline">\(x \in C\)</span> is the indicator function of
<span class="math inline">\(A = \{n: x_n = 1\}\)</span> so this mapping
is a bijection.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_space">a probability
space</a>, with the probability corresponding to the probability of
observing an event with an infinite sequence of uniform coin tosses.
This is equivalent to picking a set by randomly assigning every natural
number to be an element of it with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this note I’ll show that a randomly chosen <span class="math inline">\(x \in C\)</span> corresponds to an immune set with
probability one.</p>
<p>To see this, let <span class="math inline">\(A \subseteq
\mathbb{N}\)</span> be any infinite set. The probability that a random
element of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> contains <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as a subset of its corresponding set
must be zero, because this happens if and only if <span class="math inline">\(x_n = 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(n \in A\)</span>. The probability of any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> given coordinates being <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(2^{-n}\)</span>, so the probability of infinitely
many specified coordinates being <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>
must be <span class="math inline">\(\leq 2^{n}\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>There are only countably many infinite recursively enumerable sets
(because each is defined by a turing machine and there are only
countably many turing machines). Enumerate them as <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(P(x
\text{ is not immune}) = P(\bigcup\limits_n \{1_C : R_n \subseteq C\})
\leq \sum\limits_n P(\{1_C: R_n \subseteq C\}) = \sum\limits_n 0 =
0\)</span>. So the probability of a randomly picked subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> <em>not</em> being immune is
zero, and thus the probability of a randomly picked subset of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another way of seeing more or less the same thing (they are not
actually the same theorem, but they have the same interpretation that
the “typical” set is immune - it’s just a different notion of
typicality): the set of points containing some infinite set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a closed set (because its complement
is <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup\limits_{i \in A} \{x: x_i =
0\}\)</span>) and has empty interior (because for any finite set of
natural numbers there is some <span class="math inline">\(i \in
A\)</span> not in that set, so those numbers are not enough to
demonstate membership of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>).
Therefore the set of non-immune sets is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meagre_set">meager</a>. The comeager
sets are another type of “large” set, and in particular by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baire_category_theorem">the Baire
Category Theorem</a> comeager sets are necessarily uncountable.</p>
<p>This kind of reasoning might be a bit strange if you’re not used to
it, but it’s fairly common in set theory - rather than constructing
objects satisfying a particular property, we show that in some sense it
is “typical” that objects satisfy that property, and the ones that don’t
that we normally concern ourselves with are a weird uncommon special
case (this sort of reasoning is also common in more concrete subjects
like combinatorics).</p>
