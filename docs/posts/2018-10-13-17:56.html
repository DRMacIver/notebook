<p>Mostly saving this for later so I can find it again.</p>
<p><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/45725-how-we-teach-introductory-computer-science-is-wrong/fulltext">How We Teach Introductory Computer Science Is Wrong</a>.</p>
<p>In particular the following cites from it are interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cogtech.usc.edu/publications/kirschner_Sweller_Clark.pdf">Why Minimal Guidance During Instruction Does Not Work</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s1532690xci0201_3">The Use of Worked Examples as a Substitute for Problem Solving in Learning Algebra</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The general point being that getting people to try to solve the problem on their own as a starting point is not actually a good teaching model,
and you're better off showing them a number of worked examples first.
I find this counterintuitive personally, and I suspect they're framing it as a more certain thing than it really is, but I still think it's worth taking note of.</p>
<p>I wonder how this ties in with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xI42pfz5Ec">Sue Sentance's PyCon UK keynote</a> suggestion of teaching programming by giving people something to modify.
There I guess you are giving them a worked example first, so the two seem mutually supportive.</p>
