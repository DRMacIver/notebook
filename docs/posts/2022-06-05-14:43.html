<h1 id="how-to-use-philosophy">How to use philosophy</h1>
<p>Here’s another draft bankruptcy piece that was from a longer post in
which I was apparently trying to puzzle out the meaning of life. This
obviously went as well as you’d expect, but here’s a section from it
that I liked.</p>
<p>I used to be part of a support group, where we got together as a
group of four people every three weeks and talked about our problems. In
one session I found myself saying “If I never solve the problem and
continue this way for the rest of my life then I guess I would…” and I
couldn’t finish the sentence.</p>
<p>I know exactly why I couldn’t finish the sentence, it was because the
words that I’d intended to say were “be fine with that”. I couldn’t say
them because as soon as I started I realised they would be a lie, and I
don’t lie to support group.</p>
<p>There’s a joke I’m a huge fan of. It goes as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A certain man was in quest of immortality. He read many occult books
on the subject, but none of them gave him any practical advice on how to
become immortal. Then he heard of a certain great sage of the East who
knew the true secret of immortality. It took him twelve years to find
the sage, and when he did, he asked, “Is it really possible to become
immortal?” The sage replied, “It is really quite easy, if you do just
two things.” “And what are they?” the man asked quite eagerly. “First of
all,” replied the sage, “from now on, you must always tell the truth.
You must never make a false statement. That’s a small price to pay for
immortality, isn’t it?” “Of course!” was the reply. “Secondly,”
continued the sage just say, “I will repeat this sentence tomorrow.” If
you do these two things, I guarantee you will live forever.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(from The Gödelian Puzzle Book by Raymond Smullyan)</p>
<p>Sadly I haven’t mastered the second step yet, but I’m still working
on the first, and it comes with its own advantages.</p>
<p>After a certain amount of work (largely the sort of things I talk
about in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/labelling-feelings">labelling
feelings</a>) you get to the point where it’s really hard to
unintentionally say things you believe to be false, and attempting to do
so is often a good way to find out what you believes different things
than you thought it did.</p>
<p>Philosophy is at its most valuable when combined with this sense,
because you go through the philosophical argument, and you then identify
which parts of it don’t feel right, and you use that feeling to guide
yourself to one or more of better self-understanding or better
philosophy.</p>
<p>The result is <em>not</em> that you argue yourself into feeling
differently, but that by paying attention to the argument and your
feelings about it, you learn more about both the argument and how you
feel about the subject. Sometimes this changes your feelings, sometimes
it changes your philosophy, sometimes it changes both. The only way to
fail is for it to change neither.</p>
