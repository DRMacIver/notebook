<p>TLDR: Drunk and more than slightly self-indulgent.</p>
<p>I have inspired <a href="https://twitter.com/captain_mrs/status/1266063855018532865">the
creation of a blog</a> which is absolutely one of my victory
conditions.</p>
<p>This caused me to think about some others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every word I inspire someone to write.</li>
<li>Every time you curse my name.</li>
<li>Every comment by someone who is annoyed by my being right.</li>
<li>Every time my perfectly reasonable behaviour seems impossible to
you.</li>
<li>Every time someone sends a link to my writing to their
therapist.</li>
<li>Every time someone uses something I wrote to win an argument.</li>
<li>Every time I make someone happier for my presence.</li>
<li>But also every time someone understands themself better because of
me.</li>
<li>Every time I change how you look at the world.</li>
<li>Every conversation we have that you thought was impossible.</li>
<li>Every person whose life I make better.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do these seems inadequately selfish to you? They do to me. We ground
our values in the people around us, but if we don’t <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/being-an-example-to-others/">learn
to be a little bit selfish</a> then those values result in everyone
being miserable through trying to make everyone happy.</p>
<p>Some of them are, perhaps, a little selfish, in that they allow me to
embrace my inner villain, but villains, too, are unselfish: We’re the
ones who want to change the world for the better. The heroes are just
there to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>So what are my victory conditions for me?</p>
<ul>
<li>Every “Ah ha!” moment.</li>
<li>Every hug.</li>
<li>Every time I get to uncomplicatedly enjoy myself.</li>
<li>Every time I figure out why I can’t, and fix that.</li>
<li>Every time I get to act with my whole self, without holding
back.</li>
<li>Every (redacted).</li>
</ul>
<p>This doesn’t seem enough. I can think of a few more, but I don’t want
to write them down, and perhaps that’s the problem: Admitting to
wanting, let alone needing, things is vulnerable, and I don’t like being
vulnerable.</p>
<p>This may seem surprising, as I share a lot, but what I share is in
fact carefully curated. It doesn’t count as vulnerability if by sharing
it I rob it of its power, or if I do the work to become safe first.</p>
<p>Also, if I’m honest, I don’t really feel like the ones for me count.
They feel pointlessly self-indulgent, or like things I’m supposed to
want to want. Where they don’t the emotions don’t feel exactly
<em>good</em>. I feel like the emotion associated with healing and
growth should be something akin to joy, but that’s not quite how it
feels. It’s more like a “Ha ha! Fuck you! You can’t beat <em>me</em>!”.
It’s still other-oriented.</p>
<p>I’ve been spending the last year or two trying to work on emotional
skills, and that’s been pretty good. I liked the bit where I figured out
how to turn off social anxiety. But a lot of the drive for that has been
other oriented too: I started a relationship, I realised my emotional
baggage was now someone else’s problem, and it caused me to prioritise
it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265585499500089344">I
suggested recently to Luli</a> that two good books about being selfish
were “The Courage to be Disliked” and “Conflict is not Abuse”. I feel
it’s kinda telling that both of my book recommendations about how to be
selfish were about how to have healthier relationships with others.</p>
<p>I think perhaps the problem starts with how we conceptualise
selfishness, and the idea of boundaries. Boundaries are things you put
there to defend yourself. Defending yourself is good and proper and you
have a right to do so, so it’s not hard to assert those rights. “You are
hurting me. Stop.” is not a complicated sentiment, and it’s one that
most healthy communities acknowledge a right to.</p>
<p>But “acting to minimize suffering at the hands of others” isn’t the
hard part for me. I’ve had a lot of training in that one I’m afraid.</p>
<p>The question is, what’s next? Minimizing suffering doesn’t lead to
happiness, it just leads to non-suffering. Neutrality isn’t that great.
There’s a reason “emotional blunting” is a diagnostic term.</p>
<p>I think part of why I <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-27-07:21.html">got
quite so cranky at the inner game of tennis</a> is the idea that you can
just turn off the verbal self and the embodied self will rise to the
occasion because it’s fundamentally fine. The embodied self
<em>isn’t</em> fine sometimes. Sometimes you need to coax it out of its
shell.</p>
<p><a href="http://clarissalittler.github.io/2020/05/28/feelings-of-being-final.html">Clarissa
wrote about horizonal damage earlier</a> and this feels fairly apt. My
experience is different from theirs, but the space of the possible is
constrained. I can be selfish or unselfish in my interaction with
others, but I can’t really at present see how to be self-oriented. I am
aware of it as a theoretical possibility, but it does not appear as a
practical orientation in the world that I can access.</p>
<p>I had some more thoguhts but it’s late and I should go to bed before
this gets even more angsty, so I’m going to leave it there.</p>
