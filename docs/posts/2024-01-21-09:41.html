<p>Complementary to the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-20-12:01.html">capacities</a>
view of things, another useful broad label is “resources”. Resources are
essentially anything you can draw on to do stuff. Possibly, though not
necessarily, in a consumable way.</p>
<p>There’s some overlap between the two concepts of course, in that
every resource implies a capacity of stuff you can do by drawing on that
resource. e.g. I talked about money as a capacity, and money is
obviously also a resource.</p>
<p>One of the places I find this view most useful is creativity in
general, and writing in particular. When you are writing, you have
essentially all of your existing pool of experiences and knowledge as a
resource to draw on. All of the e.g. conversations you’ve had, books
you’ve read, idle thoughts you’ve had, things you’ve done, previous
material you’ve written, sit together in your head as a kind of pool of
inadequately articulated material that you can pull on and refine out
into something that you write about.</p>
<p>I’m a big fan of the view that creativity isn’t really something you
generate, but is instead a (skilled and difficult!) exploration of the
<em><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-things-come-to-be-as-they-are">adjacent
possible</a></em>. The resources available to you define your adjacent
possible because you draw on them to elaborate and combine them into new
material.</p>
<p>One thing that seems to be common with creative resources is that
they become stale. You see this with some authors who, for example, draw
on their professional experience and produce really good work, but the
more they become writers and the further divorced they are from that
professional experience, the more shallow their writing becomes. I liked
Lethain’s <a href="https://lethain.com/writers-who-operate">writers who
operate</a> as an expression of this problem. This was definitely part
of my concern with my consulting business too - I was a bit too far
removed from the professional experiences I was drawing on, and as a
result I’m appreciating going back into more senior IC level work. It
definitely feels like I have a much richer set of renewing experiences
to draw on now.</p>
<p>You also see this thing in fiction. For example, hypothetically, you
might have a science fiction writer who is clearly drawing on his
experience as a software developer who has dealt with a lot of office
bullshit, but the longer he’s a science fiction writer the less relevant
any of that experience becomes. Hypothetically.</p>
<p>This also came up during the pandemic I think. I don’t know if you
noticed, but it feels like a lot of material that was written in
2020-2021 is a bit… flat. As if the day to day experience people were
drawing on as stimulus for their writing was no longer there. I might be
imagining this - it’s certainly at least partly a reflection of
<em>my</em> mood during those times as anyone else’s.</p>
<p>One general strategy that I think is worth doing is to seek out
activities that cause you to generate new resources. For example, it’s
good to have regular conversations with people about the sorts of things
you might like to write about.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">A non-trivial number of my posts in general are sparked
by conversations on discord.</span> I also use <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-16-13:11.html">journaling</a>
as a place to generate half formed thoughts for drawing on.</p>
