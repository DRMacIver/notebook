<p>This was a pretty good book, and is going onto my rereadings
shelf.</p>
<p>A friend described Brene Brown as “A bit too shiny and US American
self-helpy” and that’s not an unfair description, but I found the book
fairly useful anyway.</p>
<p>The most useful aspect of this book for me was clarifying the
distinction of <em>shame</em> vs <em>guilt</em>. Guilt is feeling that
you have done something bad, shame is feeling that you are something
bad. The former is often a productive emotion (within bounds), the
latter almost never is, because thinking you are in some way
<em>intrinsically</em> bad mostly causes you to lock down and blocks you
from becoming better.</p>
<p>I also found the discussion of how shame plays out differently
depending on gender helpful for reasons that I don’t currently feel able
to elaborate well.</p>
<p>There are a number of suggested interventions in this book. I’ve yet
to try any of them and I’m not convinced that I’m going to, but I intend
to revisit it and that may change when I do. Even without those
interventions, I found it helpful for reshaping some of my perspectives
and giving me better language to talk about it.</p>
