<h1 id="what-might-a-continuous-rational-agent-look-like">What might a
continuous rational agent look like?</h1>
<p>In a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-09-09-21:02.html">previous
post</a> I said I didn’t care much about this problem, which obviously
nerd-sniped me into thinking about it.</p>
<p>So, the question is: We have a “rational” agent which is making
choices over pairs of lotteries <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{L}\)</span>, and it does this in terms of
a function <span class="math inline">\(\tau : \mathcal{L}^2 \to [0,
1]\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\tau(u, v)\)</span> means
“the probability of choosing <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> in
preference to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>
<p>We had the nice (ish) VNM theory for physically impossible
discontinuous rational agents, but what should the axioms for a
continuous rational agent look like?</p>
<p>The following seem like they should obviously hold:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, M) = 1 - \tau(M,
L)\)</span>.</li>
<li>If we define <span class="math inline">\(L \prec M\)</span> as
meaning <span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, M) = 1\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span> should be a partial order.</li>
<li>If we define <span class="math inline">\(L \tilde M\)</span> as
meaning <span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, M) = \frac{1}{2}\)</span>
then whenever <span class="math inline">\(L \tilde L', M \tilde
M'\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, M) =
\tau(L', M')\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, pL + (1 - p) M)\)</span>
should be monotonic in <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and
whenever it is non-constant that monotonicity should be strict.</li>
<li>For any pure lotteries (that is, lotteries which take a single
outcome with probability <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>) <span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, M) \in \{0, 1, \frac{1}{2}\)</span>.
i.e. for any concrete outcomes the agent either has a strict preference
or is indifferent between them.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, pM + (1 - p)N) \geq \min \tau(L,
M), \tau(L, N)\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Together with the continuity requirement, these give us roughly the
equivalence of the first four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">VNM
axioms in Wikipedia’s ordering</a>.</p>
<p>In contrast, the independence requirement obviously doesn’t and can
not hold in any meaningful sense for such an agent. Pick two lotteries
with <span class="math inline">\(L \prec M\)</span>. Consider <span class="math inline">\(\tau(pL + (1 - p)N, pM + (1 - p)N)\)</span>. This
is a continuous function of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and
when <span class="math inline">\(p = 0\)</span> it is equal to <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, therefore for any <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon &gt; 0\)</span> there must be some <span class="math inline">\(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\)</span> we must have <span class="math inline">\(\tau(pL + (1 - p)N, pM + (1 - p)N) &lt;
\epsilon\)</span>, which breaks independence in a very strong way.</p>
<p>I think this lack of independence is in some sense the “essential
difference” between a continuous and a discrete rational agent.</p>
<p>I’m not sure the above are the full set of axioms required. They feel
a bit weak - I think more may need to be said about the relationships
between <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> values over convex
combinations of lotteries.</p>
<p>However, the following two examples might be illuminating in terms of
things that obviously <em>should</em> be considered rational agents:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> be some utility function
over outcomes and let <span class="math inline">\(\alpha: [0, \infty)
\to [0, 1]\)</span> be monotonic decreasing with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(0) = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(x) \to 0\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(x \to \infty\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(E(\mu(L)) &gt; E(\mu(M))\)</span> then let <span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, M) = \frac{1 - \alpha(E(\mu(L)) -
E(\mu(M)))}{2}\)</span>. Otherwise extend according to the requirement
that <span class="math inline">\(\tau(L, M) = 1 - \tau(M,
L)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The idea is basically that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> acts as a decision procedure about
whether it’s worth finding out more information - it represents the
probability of giving up and flipping a coin. You run this procedure by
observing to increasingly high precision until you either know that
alpha is large enough that you should give up (based on a
non-deterministic choice of doing so) or which side of the border you’re
on.</p>
<p>Another procedure that I think can not be realised as an instance of
that but should still be considered rational is how a logically
omniscient Bayesian agent who is only able to access the lotteries
through sampling might behave. You start with some prior distribution
over lotteries (maybe an improper one) and query the sampler for each,
with some cost function <span class="math inline">\(\alpha: \mathbb{N}
\to [0, \infty)\)</span> for how expensive it is to evaluate <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> samples (probably <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is a linear function). You stop
and choose as soon as you hit a point where your expected value (under
your posterior distributions) of acquiring more information is strictly
less than the expected value of choosing one of the outcomes.</p>
<p>I don’t want to suggest that either of the two above are the
<em>only</em> possible rational agents in such circumstances. I suspect
in fact that there’s a much broader diversity of behaviour possible than
for VNM rational agents, which might make any axiomatic classification
hard.</p>
