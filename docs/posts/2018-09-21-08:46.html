<p>I just read Richard Gabriel’s <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Incommensurability.pdf">The
Structure of a Programming Language Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>I don’t think I have enough grounding in either lisp or the
philosophy of science to fully understand it, and want to do a second
and closer read with citation chasing, but one point really stood out
for me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that, in general, this view of engineering and science is
false: I believe engineering and science are intertwined, and for
programming languages and software creation techniques, it’s often the
case that engineering precedes science—and it’s very easy to see it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One good example is the steam engine. Engineers began its development
while scientists were making their way from the phlogiston theory of
combustion to the caloric theory of heat, both today considered
hilarious.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this observation is <em>obviously true</em>, and I’m kicking
myself for the fact that I didn’t think it was obviously true until it
was pointed out to me.</p>
<p>This is also interesting in the context of the way pure and applied
maths work. Often physicists are doing interesting mathematical things
that are “completely wrong” until a pure mathematician comes along and
provides a theory of how they could work.</p>
