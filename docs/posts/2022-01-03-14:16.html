<p>Apparently when I start a daily writing practice in which I am honest
about my feelings partly as a way to work myself out of a depressed
period, everything I write is very sad. So, here we are again.</p>
<p>A while back I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-28-15:58.html">I’m
not actually that curious</a>. I explained that although I am a
voracious reader and know a lot of stuff, it wasn’t actually generally
powered by a desire to learn things for their own sake - I learn in aid
of things I want to do, not primarily because I want to learn. Almost
everything I learn has a goal in mind. I don’t seek out knowledge
because I’m curious, I seek it out because knowledge is useful.</p>
<p>Dear past me: You realise that’s bad, right? Well, in case you don’t
realise that (I’m not sure you did), FYI that’s bad.</p>
<p>It’s also not how I used to be. I <em>definitely</em> used to be
curious, and just read about things because they were fun and
interesting. I had a very nerdy notion of fun and interesting which
means that this ended up with me taking a book about classical
mechanics<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I still know a surprising amount about Lagrangian
formulations of Newtonian physics, although it’s all got a bit rusty</span> as my summer vacation reading when I
was 16, but it was absolutely something I picked because I wanted to
learn about it and not because I needed to.</p>
<p>My degree was in pure mathematics, which I certainly didn’t get into
because I had applications in mind for the connection between the axioms
of set theory and questions in analysis.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">this was what my final year essay was on. It wasn’t very
good</span></p>
<p>Apparently as a kid I would fairly regularly give adults
mostly-correct lectures on various subjects I’d been learning about.
Palm trees and black holes seem to be the topic that people tell stories
about me doing this, but I’m sure there are others.</p>
<p>At some point this got lost. I don’t really know when, or why.</p>
<p>It feels like part of the problem is agency. As a kid it’s easy to be
curious about things, because nothing you do actually matters, and also
you’re mostly bored out of your mind. So why not learn new things purely
because they’re interesting and you want to stuff your brain with
knowledge?</p>
<p>Also, you’re a child, and thus you’re still full of energy. The
fatigue of ageing and the burnout of life haven’t set in.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Not that those are inevitable. My parents seem like they
still have way more energy than I do.</span></p>
<p>Now it feels like I’ve got such limited brain capacity and energy,
and such a greater degree of agency that <em>of course</em> I spend it
on useful things, because I feel guilty about not doing so.</p>
<p>Except I think even as I write it that that’s a cope. If that were
the case I’d probably be doing far more useful things than I do.</p>
<p>Really the core problem is that <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia">it’s hard to
care about things</a>, and usefulness is a crutch. It’s much easier to
solve a problem, which is obviously good. It’s even better if <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-02-12:34.html">it’s
somebody else’s problem</a>.</p>
<p>I keep wanting to frame this in terms of justification, but I don’t
think that’s quite right. The problem isn’t that I feel like I have to
be able to justify my actions to someone, but that they need to feel
somehow purposeful. It’s not that someone will attack me for doing it,
it’s that if I spend energy on something purposeless a huge wave of
“What’s the point?” rises up and I get distracted and go do something
else.</p>
<p>Often it starts before that and I can’t even generate the
“purposeless” actvitity in the first place. I try to generate a plan for
what to do and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-02-08:53.html">my
brain glitches</a>.</p>
<p>This is depression, of course. It’s well-managed, reasonably high
functioning depression, but it’s still depression.</p>
<p>I think of depression as a constriction of the felt world of
possibilities. A narrowing of the actions that you feel able to take. A
lot of my incessant “curiousity” in search of the useful feels like I’m
trying to squeeze a vast level of interest in the world through the
narrow passages that depression has left me. What comes out is still
pretty good, because I’m clever and competent, but it’s fairly anemic
compared to what I’d be doing if less depressed.</p>
<p>A lot of this focus on usefulness feels not so much like I’m
motivated to be useful (I am, but it’s more of a “make the pain go away”
motivation than something I necessarily care deeply about), but that
it’s something to do while I’m here. I’ve got all these capabilities,
there are things I can do that help make things better, might as well.
It’s slightly less fundamentally unsatisfying than wasting my day
scrolling Twitter and watching YouTube.</p>
<p>I think I <em>do</em> fundamentally care about helping people, but
it’s all swallowed up by the general meh. Certainly I would
<em>like</em> to be positively motivated towards helping people instead
of it being something that hurts if I don’t do it, but these days I’m
struggling to be positively motivated about much of anything very
serious.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1476967194101698561">I
wrote on Twitter about how incredibly mind-numbingly bored I am of the
pandemic</a>, and that I really need more in person contact with people
than I’m getting. That feels like part of this but I don’t know how much
of it.</p>
<p>The absence of curiousity feels in some way like a primary thing in
its own right that I should take seriously just as much as the absence
of people. Learning things should be a joyful activity, and the fact
that it’s not is a huge sign.</p>
<p>One of my working theories of how to work with depression is to be
constantly exploring the edge of the depression comfort zone - do things
that you feel <em>slightly</em> too depressed to do. If depression comes
from a restriction of what feels safe, exploring the boundaries of where
you feel safe helps you relearn those as safe and then you can expand
gradually outwards.</p>
<p>Sometimes this even works.</p>
<p>Well, that’s too cynical. It often works, it’s just a bit of a two
steps forward one step back process. The depression comes back, but it’s
easier to claw your way out of it the next time because you believe you
can do that.</p>
<p>So the starting point for solving the curiousity problem is something
like asking how I would behave if I were as curious as I’d like to be,
and walking in that direction until I hit the edge of the comfort
zone.</p>
<p>The obvious thing is that I would learn things just for interest. For
some reason the example that comes to mind here is physics youtube. I’ve
been enjoying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SteveMould">Steve
Mould’s YouTube channel</a> recently for example. I really respect the
urge to just go “How does that work?” and put in the effort to find the
answer. I definitely used to have some of that, and I’d like to have it
again.</p>
<p>The other thing that comes to mind is that I’d talk to people more
about things I find interesting. I really don’t do this very much -
these days all my writing is about stuff that’s useful (in some very
generalised sense of the term), which is a shame in and of itself - but
really I have in person conversations in mind. Generally I just let
other people take the lead, and feel very inhibited in proposing
conversation topics and just going on about them, and that feels
necessary if rather daunting.</p>
<p>Who knows if any of this will actually work, but it feels worth a
try.</p>
