<p>(A very short post, because I’ve been struggling to maintain the
daily writing habit recently and it’s useful to remind myself that this
is possible)</p>
<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZCqSNc">A Little Book on the Human
Shadow</a> by Robert Bly, page 77:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wallace Stevens was not willing to change his way of life, despite
all the gifts he received, and all the advice he read in his own
poems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, I think, a useful reminder to anyone who wants to change
their life, but it’s especially a useful reminder to me and others who
have a perhaps overly intellectual approach to the problem. I’m building
a practice of change on a huge amount of reading and writing, which can
lead to the trap of confusing the knowledge of how to change with the
change itself.</p>
<p>Much of what I write is, if I do say so myself, very good advice to
how to change and improve your life (especially if your problems look
like mine). I’m not always that great at following it - I’m no Wallace
Stevens (though I do not know if Bly’s criticisms of him are at all
fair) - I do listen to my own advice, and I do follow it, but perhaps
not as consistently as I might.</p>
<p>Knowing how and what to change is important - vital even - but change
has to be grounded in a willingness to change, and to then do the work
of changing.</p>
