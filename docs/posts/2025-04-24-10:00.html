<p>There’s a story repeated so often that it’s a cliche of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Gauss</a>’s
mathematics teacher setting the class the task of adding up the numbers
1 to 100, supposedly to waste their time and give them a break, only for
Gauss to almost immediately give the correct answer.</p>
<p>I think it’s a usefully illustrative example to look at for learning
some of the basics of mathematics. Partly this is because it illustrates
one of the key uses and methods of mathematics: Getting an answer that
you could in theory work out laboriously much faster through logical
deducation.</p>
<p>Mostly, though, I’m going to use it to showcase a bunch of different
ways of thinking through a mathematical problem, and use it to teach
some common mathematical notation.</p>
<p>So, let’s figure out how to do this.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to figure out is to how to write it down.
Here are two obvious ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>“The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.”</li>
<li>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16
+ 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 + 30 +
31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36 + 37 + 38 + 39 + 40 + 41 + 42 + 43 + 44 + 45
+ 46 + 47 + 48 + 49 + 50 + 51 + 52 + 53 + 54 + 55 + 56 + 57 + 58 + 59 +
60 + 61 + 62 + 63 + 64 + 65 + 66 + 67 + 68 + 69 + 70 + 71 + 72 + 73 + 74
+ 75 + 76 + 77 + 78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 86 + 87 + 88 +
89 + 90 + 91 + 92 + 93 + 94 + 95 + 96 + 97 + 98 + 99 + 100</li>
</ol>
<p>Neither of these are actually very good.</p>
<p>One of the first lessons of doing mathematics: A lot of mathematics
is about developing good notation for representing the problem. The
problem with the first, plain English, one is that it’s hard to
manipulate. We want to be able to do algebra with it, and it’s hard to
do algebra with plain English language. Modern mathematics owes a lot to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Recorde">Robert
Recorde</a> for giving us the equals sign (and popularising the plus and
minus signs), because trying to manipulate sums with plain English
language is an absolute pain.</p>
<p>The second one is bad for two main reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s very clunky and unwieldy. If you’re going to be repeating the
expression a lot, you don’t want to write that out over and over again.
Also, are you sure you’re reading it correctly? Would you have noticed
if I’d dropped 31 from the middle, or repeated 23 twice?</li>
<li>It doesn’t generalise well. Suppose we wanted instead to add up all
the numbers from 1 to 50, or 1 to 1000, we’d have to write an entirely
new expression for it. There’s no way to do algebra where the end point
is variable with this expression.</li>
</ol>
<p>So let me give you two other ways to write it:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(1 + \ldots + 100\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{100}
i\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>In the first, the <span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span> just
means “and so on”. You’re expected to figure out what it means from
context, but you’re also expected not to write it unless it’s obvious
from context what you mean. If we’d wanted to make it a bit more obvious
we could have written it <span class="math inline">\(1 + 2 + \ldots + 99
+ 100\)</span>.</p>
<p>The second is a much more precise notation and looks completely
inscrutable when you first encounter it, but has a fairly
straightforward meaning: The <span class="math inline">\(\sum\)</span>
represents a sum of an expression, where the expression references a
variable <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> that varies over some
range. The <span class="math inline">\(i = 1\)</span> at the bottom
indicates that the sum is over a range of values of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> starting with <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and the <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> at the top indicates that <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> is the last element. The <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to the right means that the expression
we are summing is <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, for example, <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^3 i
= 1 + 2 + 3\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i =
2}^3 i^2 = 2^2 + 3^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\sum\)</span> notation is very
convenient because it allows us to compactly represent complicated
expressions. It’s also useful for making generalisations. e.g. if we
wanted to work out the answer to this for any number, we could write
<span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n i\)</span> to indicate
that the end point is an arbitrary integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">There are some implicit notational conventions here by
the way. <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is usually an index
variable. <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are both expected to be integers by
that choice. This isn’t required, but it’s conventional. However, you
would only ever use integers as sum indexed or bounds like this, and
that’s not conventional, it doesn’t really make sense to use
non-integers here.</span></p>
<p>To start with though, we’ll keep working with the <span class="math inline">\(\ldots\)</span> notation.</p>
<p>Now, let’s solve the problem.</p>
<p>We can write <span class="math inline">\(1 + \ldots + 100\)</span> as
<span class="math inline">\((1 + \ldots 50) + (51 + \ldots
100)\)</span>, because we can break up the sum however we like.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Technically speaking we are using what’s called the
associativity rule of addition here.</span></p>
<p>We can also reverse a sum if we want, so we could write the second
one equally well as <span class="math inline">\(100 + \ldots +
51\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, there are exactly 50 elements in each sum, so we can pair them
up and rearrange the sum as follows. <span class="math inline">\((1 +
100) + (2 + 99) + \ldots + (49 + 52) + (50 + 51)\)</span>. Now, notice
that each of these terms adds up to exactly 101. You can check that
<span class="math inline">\(1 + 100 = 101, 2 + 99 = 101\)</span> etc but
you can also this because each time you move right, you add one to the
first term and subtract one from the second, so the value stays
constant. This means that this sum is exactly 50 copies of 101, so the
sum is <span class="math inline">\(50 \times 101 = 5050\)</span>.</p>
<p>I think a pretty reasonable question for you to ask at this point is
how on earth you’re expected to come up with a trick like that. If
you’ve seen this problem before it’s old hat, but if you had to come up
with it on the spot, how would you do that?</p>
<p>The honest answer is I don’t know. A lot of things like this you just
figure out by fiddling with the problem and getting an instinct for what
works. This sort of approach is what I think of as a “trick”, and
sometimes you spot the trick which lets you massively simplify the
problem, and sometimes you don’t. As you do more mathematics, you
develop both a familiar bag of tricks, and you learn to apply them in
new circumstances. The trick here is something like “try grouping
different parts of the sum together to see if they add up to something
convenient”.</p>
<p>For example, here’s another way you could use a similar trick.
Suppose I asked you to calculate <span class="math inline">\(1 - 2 + 3 -
4 + \ldots + 99 - 100\)</span> (you could also write this as <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{100} (-1)^{i - 1} i\)</span>
) - that is, it’s the same sum as before, but this time the signs
alternate between positive and negative.</p>
<p>Well, here you could group it as follows: <span class="math inline">\((1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \ldots + (99 - 100)\)</span>.
Each of those expressions in brackets is <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>, because each time the number on the
right is exactly one more than the number on the left. As before we have
exactly 50 elements, so the result is <span class="math inline">\((-1)
\times 50 = -50\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is basically the same trick, but with a different grouping.</p>
<p>Mathematics doesn’t necessarily rely on knowing and spotting things
like this, but it’s a very common part of mathematical practice.
Sometimes they’re essential and you can’t figure out any other way to
solve the problem without some sort of trick like this, but often
they’re just a way of bypassing some tedious calculation or another.</p>
<p>Now, one problem with the way we solved this is that it doesn’t
generalise all that well. For example, suppose I asked you to add up all
the numbers between <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(101\)</span>, how would you do it?<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Well you’d add 101 to 5050 and get 5151 of course,
because you just worked out the sum from 1 to 100. But suppose you
<em>hadn’t</em> done that.</span></p>
<p>The previous trick doesn’t work because it relied on there being an
even number of values in the sum. If we tried to do the same thing as
before we’d have to break the sum up as something like <span class="math inline">\((1 + \ldots + 50) + 51 + (52 + \ldots
101)\)</span>, because there’s a number left over in the middle. We can
then do the same pairing as before and get <span class="math inline">\((1 + 101) + (2 + 100) + \ldots + (50 +
52)\)</span> for the paired sums, and the result is <span class="math inline">\(51 + 102 \times 50 = 51 + 5100 = 5151\)</span>.
Which is, conveniently, <span class="math inline">\(5050 + 101\)</span>,
so we’ve not messed up the calculation somewhere.</p>
<p>This works but is unsatisfying. In particular, let’s try to work it
out for a general number <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. In
order to do this as above, we’ll have to consider two special cases:
First, let’s assume that <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is an
even number. Let’s say <span class="math inline">\(n = 2m\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then we can write <span class="math inline">\(1 + \ldots n = (1 +
\ldots m) + ((m + 1) + \ldots n)\)</span> as before, and use the same
pairing trick to get <span class="math inline">\((1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1))
+ \ldots (m + (m + 1))\)</span>. As before, each of these individual
bracketed expressions are always equal to <span class="math inline">\(n
+ 1\)</span>, and we have <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> copies
of the expression, so the answer is <span class="math inline">\(m (n +
1) = \frac{n (n + 1)}{2}\)</span> (because <span class="math inline">\(m
= \frac{n}{2}\)</span>).</p>
<p>Now, suppose <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd. We could
repeat the pairing trick, but we can also use <span class="math inline">\(1 + \ldots + n = (1 + \ldots + (n - 1)) +
n\)</span>, and if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd then
<span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> is even, so we can use the
previous expression for the sum when <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even, plugging in <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> in place of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. This gives us <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(n - 1)(n + 1 - 1)}{2} = \frac{(n -
1)n}{2}\)</span> for the sum up to <span class="math inline">\(n -
1\)</span>, and thus <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(n - 1)n}{2} +
n\)</span> for the whole sum.</p>
<p>Now, let’s make that expression a bit nicer. <span class="math inline">\(\frac{(n - 1)n}{2} + n = \frac{n^2 - n + 2n}{2}  =
\frac{n^2 + n}{2} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Something worth noting here is that although we had to handle the odd
and even cases differently, we got the same expression out in both
cases. This should make us a little suspicious that we’re missing
something and that there’s a nicer proof here.</p>
<p>Another thing that should make us suspicious but that is actually
fine is that the answer to this question should be an integer, as we’ve
only added up integers, but we’ve got a fraction in the answer. It’s
worth doing a sanity check that this is fine, but it is: Exactly one of
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n
+ 1\)</span> must be even (because if you add one to an even number you
get an odd number, and vice versa), so the expression on top is always
even, and dividing it by two gets you an even number.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It’s very easy to make mistakes in mathematics, so it’s
good to have a habit of doing little cross checks like this where you
look at the answer you came up with and ask if it could possibly be
correct.</span></p>
<p>Anyway, there’s another trick, and that fraction is a clue. We made
this work by pairing up numbers together, and there’s a 2 in the end, so
perhaps we would find it easier to work out twice the answer than we do
to work out the answer directly.</p>
<p>We can write</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
2 \times (1 + \ldots + n) &amp; = (1 + \ldots + n) + (1 + \ldots + n) \\
&amp; = (1 + \ldots + n) + (n + \ldots + 1) \\
&amp; = (n + 1) + \ldots + (1 + n) \\
\end{align*}\]</span></p>
<p>This gives us <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> copies of <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span>, so twice the answer is <span class="math inline">\(n (n + 1))\)</span> and the answer is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)</span> as desired. This is a
much neater proof, but I think a slightly harder trick to spot.</p>
<p>I think this is a good time to write some Greek.</p>
<p>We can write <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i =
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n (n + 1 - i)\)</span>. This is basically “running
the sum backwards” like we did above. The first element is <span class="math inline">\(n + 1 - 1 = n\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(n + 1 - 2 = n - 1\)</span>, etc. all the way to
the end where it’s <span class="math inline">\(n + 1 - n =
1\)</span>.</p>
<p>This means that <span class="math inline">\(2 \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n
i  = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i = \sum\limits_{i
= 1}^n i + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n (n + 1 - i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, because these sums are over the same range, we can group the
expressions inside them together, so <span class="math inline">\(2
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i + (n + 1 - i) =
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n (n + 1) = n (n + 1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If you’re unused to dense mathematical notation this may not seem
obviously clearer or better than the above, but it has the advantage of
being compact and easy to manipulate, and it lets you result a lot of
complex reasoning to fairly simple mechanical manipulation.</p>
<p>So now we’ve seen how to work out this answer. But why is it
true?</p>
<p>This is another key feature of doing mathematics:<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I wrote about this in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-22-16:32.html">algebra
and insight</a> but that example only works if you’re already a
moderately advanced mathematician.</span>
Often you should be unsatisfied with mere answers, and looking at the
problem from another angle will help you really understand it.</p>
<p>Is this particular example worth really understanding? Well… probably
not. I think if you find yourself doing a lot of this sort of sums<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Applications include “being a mathematician in the early
to mid 20th century”, “taking a maths exam”, “for the sheer joy of it”,
and “if you do a really large amount of mathematics every now and then
you will run into a case where you really do have a use for this and you
will be so delighted that you’ll ignore how rusty you’ve got at it”.
Also probably combinatorics or something like that.</span>, it’s worth playing around with a
lot of simple examples like this in order to get a really good intuition
for how everything fits together.</p>
<p>But right now it’s worth really understanding this because it’s a
nice illustrative example of the general mathematical phenomenon.</p>
<p>Imagine, or draw<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I really should include a diagram here but I can’t be
bothered, sorry. If you’re wondering how to draw <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> boxes, the answer is you don’t you draw
some fixed small number and assume that it generalises. This is why I
don’t like visual proofs that much.</span> the numbers as rows of blocks
stacked on top of each other. On the bottom row you’ve got <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> numbers, then <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span>, and so on, until you’ve got <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> block on the final row. The result is a
sort of ragged triangle.</p>
<p>Now, take a copy of that, and flip it upside down, and stack it on
top of the other one. The jagged edges will line up, and you’ll get a
rectangle. How big is the rectangle? Well, it’s got <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> items on the base, because that was
your bottom row, and it’s <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span>
tall, because your triangle is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
tall and you had to stack an extra row on top. So there are <span class="math inline">\(n(n + 1)\)</span> blocks in the rectangle, of
which exactly half must have come from our original triangle, so there
were <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)</span> blocks in
the original triangle, and <span class="math inline">\(1 + \ldots + n =
\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)</span> as desired.</p>
<p>This is, in some sense, the same proof as we had before, but the
geometrical representation of it seems helpful for people, and for more
complicated examples it can be genuinely very useful.</p>
<p>Here is, I promise, one final<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">For the purpose of this post I mean. There are
infinitely many ways to do this, and at least several of the other ones
are interesting in their own right.</span> way to do it, which is
also often useful: We take a guess, and prove that that guess was
correct. For example, suppose that we guessed the answer was <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)</span>. How might we prove
that we were right?</p>
<p>The answer is to use something called “proof by induction”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn9"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn9" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Any philosophers reading this, don’t panic! It’s a
completely different meaning of the word “induction” that has nothing to
do with the philosophical notion of induction.</span></p>
<p>The way a proof by induction of some claim (your “induction
property”) works is that you establish:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s true for <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (or anywhere
else you want to start - your “base case”)</li>
<li>If it’s true for <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> then
it’s true for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>And this is sufficient to prove that it’s true for every integer
greater than or equal to your base case.</p>
<p>Why? Well, because of a proof by contradiction. A proof by
contradiction is when you assume something that you’re not sure is true,
work through the consequences, and conclude something false, which means
your original assumption must be false.</p>
<p>To see that proof by induction works, assume the opposite: Suppose
there were some <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which the
induction property were false. Then there must be some <em>smallest</em>
such <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> for which the property is
false. If so, then the property must be true for <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span>, as the property holds for <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, so we must have <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 1\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(n
- 1\)</span> is still an integer greater than or equal to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and it’s smaller than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, which we picked to be the smallest
integer for which the property is false. But the second part of our
induction conditions was that it’s true for <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span> then it’s true for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, which contradicts our claim that it
was false for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Anyway, proof by induction.</p>
<p>Our inductive property is that <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i = \frac{n(n +
1)}{2}\)</span>. This is true for <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, you can just check that by calculating
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{2}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Suppose it’s true for <span class="math inline">\(n - 1\)</span>.
That is, <span class="math inline">\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i =
\frac{(n - 1)n}{2}\)</span>. Then<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn10"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn10" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is in fact the same calculation we did in the
even/odd case above.</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i &amp; = n + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i \\

&amp; = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\

<p>So the property holds for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as
well, and the result is proved by induction.</p>
<p>This does, of course, invite the question of how on earth we would
have made this guess if we didn’t already know the answer.</p>
<p>I think there are roughly three ways that can come about.</p>
<p>The first is that you can just look at the first couple elements of
the sequence and try to puzzle out a formula that works. <span class="math inline">\(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \ldots\)</span> seems plausible
that there should be a factor of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
in there, so what happens if we divide by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>? We get <span class="math inline">\(1,
\frac{3}{2}, 2, \frac{5}{2}, 3, \ldots\)</span>, so that looks like it’s
going up by half each time, so <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n +
1}{2}\)</span>, and that gives us our guess.</p>
<p>The second is that sometimes you just have a hunch. I think it would
be weird to have a hunch in this case and not be able to spot the better
proof, but in other cases it will often be the case. This is
particularly true when think it’s true because of some sort of
“heuristic argument” that doesn’t actually work rigorously, but does
give you a pretty good idea of what the answer should be.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn11"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn11" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is particularly common when you’re trying to show
something a bit weaker than strict equality, such as e.g. that some
quantity never gets too large.</span></p>
<p>The third common way is that you proved it another way first, but
that proof was long and complicated or involved some advanced concepts
you don’t want to introduce here, so you “guessed” in the sense that you
already knew the right answer, but it was easier to prove it by
induction than convince the reader of it another way.</p>
<p>OK, that’s enough adding numbers.</p>
<p>What should you take away from this post?</p>
<p>The first thing I’d like you to take away from it is a certain
familiarity with the notation. Being able to read this sort of notation
is entirely essential if you’re to read any mathematics at all.
Mathematics is built on notation, and the notation I’ve used here is
very common.</p>
<p>Another thing I’d like you to take away from this is that there are
many ways to get the answer <em>and they all get the same answer</em>.
There isn’t a single right way to do it, and there can’t be. Mathematics
is a discipline built on solving problems, and if there were always a
single correct way to do it, every problem would be trivial. Doing
mathematics is about developing facility with mathematical problems, and
getting a sense of how to solve them.</p>
<p>Another is that figuring out which mathematical tool to use is a
skilled practice like any other - through repeated encounters with
mathematics you develop intuitions about what works and what to try.</p>
<p>Reading other people’s mathematics is a good way to start with this
but importantly the proof that people show you is often not the proof
they used to come up with the idea. This means that often when reading
someone’s proof you will have some reaction like “Oh, that’s clever, but
I have no idea how you’d come up with that.” or “What the fuck is going
on here? I have no intuition for any of this”. If you’re lucky you can
just ask them how they came up with it, but if not then I think it’s
worth trying to prove it yourself by figuring out how all the different
pieces fit together and see how you’d do it for yourself.</p>
<p>One reason these multiple avenues of proof are important is that
mathematics is not <em>just</em> a discipline of problem solving, it’s a
discipline of concept formation, and one of the things that drives
concepts is developing a certain aesthetic sense and desire for
intuition around the problems you solve. Many concepts are discovered
because you look at a proof and go “I don’t like that proof. Can I do
better?”</p>
