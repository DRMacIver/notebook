<p>Here's the final draft bankruptcy piece. It's a pity, because I think it's a good piece,
but it turns out that I absolutely do not want to write about ethics right now.</p>
<p>It's definitely not going to hold together as a cohesive whole, sorry, this is in a stage
where I was pulling a bunch of disparate pieces together and haven't yet done the work to
join the dots. Hopefully the individual bits will be interesting though.</p>
<h3>Good people don't need rules</h3>
<p>One response I got to <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/learning-to-walk-through-walls">learning to walk through
walls</a>
was surprise that I didn't talk about ethics in it. Many things become
easier when you let go of your ethical rules, right?</p>
<p>I think it's a mistake to think of it this way, and ethics should be
treated not as part of the rules you operate under, but instead about
the goals you are trying to achieve. Being a good person isn't about
only doing good things, it's about wanting to do good things and not
wanting to do bad things.</p>
<p>One place this comes up is in the strawman version of a common argument
between religious people and atheists, where the religious person asks
what stops you going around murdering people without god, and the
atheist's response is that the thing that stops you from murdering
people is <em>not wanting to murder people</em>.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that this is a fair and accurate summary of the
argument. The strawman version of it is usefully illustrative in the
same way that our opening anxiety loop parody was.</p>
<p>Ideally, ethics shouldn't be about a set of rules that must be obeyed,
but instead baked into your motivations and view of the world. This is
hopefully fairly intuitive. Would you really e.g. think well of your
someone if you knew that they really wanted to go out and do some murder
and the only thing stopping them was their sense of ethics?</p>
<h3>Rules as a necessary developmental stage</h3>
<p>Of course, in order to get to this ideal state, you sometimes have to
pass through non-ideal ones.</p>
<p>There's a great section from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhRNMj6UNYY">an interview with Robert Kegan (a famous
developmental psychologist) I watched a while
ago</a>. Here's a cleaned up
transcript of it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was talking with a social worker the other day who works with
adolescents who have come out of the court system and who've
committed crimes.</p>
<p>She was talking about a young man maybe 16, 17, years old who had a
record of auto theft, and she told me about a session she had with him
where he he came to her and said "you know you'd be proud of me
because, I know I shouldn't, but I do still hang out with a number of
rough friends who could easily get me in trouble, and just this
weekend I was hanging out with them and they wanted they wanted me to
join them in stealing a car, and ordinarily I might have just gone
along with that, and because of our work together I didn't."</p>
<p>And she said "I'm really glad to hear about that. Tell me a little
bit more."</p>
<p>He said "well they wanted me to steal this car and I was going to and
I stopped and I thought to myself that if I steal this car there's a
very good chance we're gonna get caught, and if I get caught, because
I'm on probation, unlike these other friends, they're gonna get let
off but I'm gonna go back to jail."</p>
<p>She said to him "well, I'm really glad that you didn't steal the
car, but I have to be honest and say that I wished the reason you
chosen not to steal the car was not just that if you did you might go
to jail, but because you gave some thought to how that person would
feel and the fact that his car's not your car and then he would
naturally feel bad."</p>
<p>And she said he just looked right at her and he said "yes, but I'm
not there yet", and she she sat back and she thought that was a
beautiful answer that he was being absolutely truthful and that her
hope for him was a little further ahead of where he was.</p>
<p>She was kind of telling a story on herself kind of saying how you know
you can learn from your clients, even from your 16 year old clients.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because it's Robert Kegan, he naturally (and probably at least partly
correctly) interprets this as a developmental psychology stage
transition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When he said "I'm not quite there yet", from a developmentalist
point of view we would also feel like he was telling a very important
truth.</p>
<p>What he was saying was "just give me credit for the fact I didn't
steal the car, but my underlying logic is still about what's in my
best interest and the reason I didn't steal it was because I had at
least enough foresight to consider that I could get caught, I could
get sent to jail".</p>
<p>That is itself a given stage of development. It is the stage that
comes before the socialized mind. What she was hoping for was a
qualitatively different stage where people live not only to pursue
their own interests and look at others as sort of opportunities to get
their own needs met, or obstacles to getting their needs met, but
where you actually begin to internalize something of the the values
and beliefs of others around you. It starts with your society, as that
make it conveyed through your immediate family, or your faith
community or others beyond it, and eventually there's the possibility
that I start relating to others - family members, friends, society not
just in terms of getting my own needs met but where I actually become
more a part of society, because society has become more a part of me.</p>
<p>I begin to internalize the values, beliefs, and expectations of
important people around me.</p>
<p>We call that the socialized mind, because you begin to develop the
internal psychology that permits socialization, that permits you to
become a member of a tribe that permits you to become a part of a
community of interest larger than one, larger than your own
self-interest where you will be able to actually subordinate some of
your maybe short-term interests on behalf of enhancing the
relationship, and when that stage evolves, typically in adolescence,
it is a cause for relief and celebration on the part of parents and
the community at large who live with this adolescent.</p>
<p>It enables employers of fast-food businesses who want to hire
teenagers to feel they can hire a person who's begun to make that
transition because they become trustworthy you can kind of count on
them they may be able to keep their agreements not just because
they'll get into they don't but because they want you to continue to
trust them and to respect them.</p>

<p>In order to get to the point where your ethics is properly integrated
into your motivations, you probably need to pass through a period where
you hold very tightly to ethical rules. This is a good learning tool,
but holding onto it too tightly or for too long is bad for you.</p>
<p>Think of it like training wheels: They're very useful when learning to
ride a bike, but if you never take them off you'll never actually become
a proficient bike rider.</p>
<h3>The non-composability of ethical rules</h3>
<p>The big problem with rules is that they conflict, and then what do you
do?</p>
<p>The big central rule based ethical philosophy is called deontology, and
is often associated with Immanuel Kant. In deontology there are
inviolable rules that you are supposed to follow in order to be ethical.</p>
<p>Where those rules come from varies. I think the most common place to
find real deontologists in the wild is in religion, which has the nice
simple answer that rules come from god. I think, in practice, even
religious people tend not to be pure deontologists, but there is a
strong deontological component to their beliefs.</p>
<p>Kant instead believes that rules are derived from the "categorical
imperative", a term that definitely doesn't mean "whatever Kant made up
based on his prejudices as a 18th century middle class Austrian
philosopher", but instead is about acting in accordance with
universalizable principles. e.g. you shouldn't lie because a world in
which everyone lied freely wouldn't function.</p>
<p>The problem with having hard and fast ethical rules is that sometimes
they will contradict each other. For example, suppose you're in Nazi
Germany and, as a good person, are hiding a Jewish family in your attic.
A Gestapo officer comes to your door and asks if you've seen any Jews
around. You know full well that the fate in store for them if caught is
a concentration camp. Do you lie to the Gestapo?</p>
<p>Kant thinks you should tell the Gestapo the
truth.</p>
<p>Kant is wrong.</p>
<p>There are many points of ethics on which I think reasonable people can
disagree, but this is not one of them. Anyone who claims the correct
thing to do is to tell the truth to the Gestapo agent is a bad person
(or at least claiming ot be one) and is not to be trusted.</p>
<p>The problem here is that we have two conflicting duties: To protect the
lives of the family sheltering with us, and to tell the
truth. We are not able to follow both
(Or, at least, the path to following both is not obvious to us in the
moment - possibly a sufficiently clever person could come up with a
workaround, or possibly you could apply your mad Jiu Jitsu skills and
punch out the Nazi, or possibly a time traveller from the future
could... The point is that we work with the resources available to us in
the moment), and thus must choose between them, and much of the time
even if there is <em>theoretically</em> a path available that resolves the
contradictions, in the moment we must navigate the fact that we see no
such path. This isn't solvable by pre-gaming every ethical conundrum we
find ourselves in, because the world is complex enough that we cannot
anticipate everything), and this leads us to ask the question we probably
should have asked at the start: What do we mean by <em>should</em>? What
actually happens if we break one of these ethical rules?</p>
<p>(It's unclear to me whether Kant thinks this is an example of a
contradiction in rules (mostly because I haven't checked too hard
because the more I read Kant on ethics the more I want to not read Kant
on ethics and also the more I wish I had a time machine so I could go
back in time and slap Kant), but to me it is reasonably clear that at
least one of two things are true: a) There is a moral duty to protect
the Jewish family in this example or b) Duties to follow rules are not
sufficient to describe the ethical requirements on being a good person,
and those duties must sometimes be overruled.)</p>
<p>Here's part of an answer: You should feel guilty about it, regardless of
whether it was the correct thing to do.</p>
<h3>The feeling of guilt</h3>
<p>So you did something slightly wrong. Honestly, you knew it was wrong,
why did you do it? Only a monster deliberately does wrong things.
Therefore you're a monster. You know it. You're the worst.</p>
<p>But wait! Maybe you were forced into it! Or maybe you in fact had a
<em>very good reason</em> for doing the thing. Maybe it's completely justified
and not wrong at all, and therefore you don't have to feel guilty and
are not a monster after all! Yes, this must be the case, you've done
nothing wrong and you will continue to argue that you've done nothing
wrong until the part of you insisting that you have stops trying to make
you feel guilty.</p>
<p>In <em>fact</em>, it's the people who forced you into this situation who are at
fault. They're the real monsters. You should punish them.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a huge exaggeration of the thought process most
people go through, but it's not as much of an exaggeration for everyone
as you might hope, and many of us go through some smaller version of it
on a pretty regular basis.</p>
<p>Let's talk a bit about what's going on here.</p>
<p>For many people, guilt is one of the worst emotions they regularly
experience.</p>
<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p>This essay had some huge footnotes, and they don't really make sense integrated into the main text, so here they are as a subsection.</p>
<h4>The Doctor on virtue</h4>
<p>In one of those oddly memorable scenes from otherwise forgettable media,
here's The Doctor on the subject of good mean not needing rules:</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O5JnqPSzSLo" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>
<blockquote>
<p>Madame Kovarian: The anger of a good man is not a problem. Good men
have too many rules.</p>
<p>The Doctor: Good men don't need rules. Today is not the day to find
out why I have so many.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Kant on lying to murderers</h4>
<p>Naturally Kant didn't use the Gestapo example because it was a bit after
his time. In his original conception it's a murderer. The Gestapo
example seems to have become widely used though.</p>
<p>I was worried that I was being unfair to Kant and that his actual
opinion is likely to be more nuanced, so I looked up the original.</p>
<p>So, here is his argument, from "On a supposed right to tell lies from
benevolent motives":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For instance, if you have <em>by a lie</em> hindered a man who is even now
planning a murder, you are legally responsible for all the
consequences. But if you have strictly adhered to the truth, public
justice can find no fault with you, be the unforeseen consequence what
it may. It is possible that whilst you have honestly answered Yes to
the murderer's question, whether his intended victim is in the house,
the latter may have gone out unobserved, and so not have come in the
way of the murderer, and the deed therefore have not been done;
whereas, if you lied and said he was not in the house, and he had
really gone out (though unknown to you), so that the murderer met him
as he went, and executed his purpose on him, then you might with
justice be accused as the cause of his death. For, if you had spoken
the truth as well as you knew it, perhaps the murder while seeking for
his enemy in the house might have been caught by neighbours coming up
and the deed been prevented. Whoever then <em>tells a lie</em> however good
his intentions may be, must answer for the consequences of it, even
before the civil tribunal, and must pay the penalty for them, however
unforeseen they may have been; because truthfulness is a duty that
must be regarded as the basis of all duties founded on contract, the
laws of which would be rendered uncertain and useless if the least
exception to them were admitted.</p>
<p>To be <em>truthful</em> (honest) in all declarations is therefore a sacred
unconditional command of reason, and not to be limited by any
expediency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, to be blunt, a really fascinating combination of blatant
motivated reasoning and sheer moral cowardice. Kant's argument is that
you should do the action you know is likely to get people killed because
<em>then you will not be blamed for any negative consequences?</em></p>
<p>On the subject of blaming Kant for negative consequences of his actions,
when I complained about this passage on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/mbateman/status/1527320119633797127">Matt Bateman sent
me</a> the paper
"<a href="https://www.csus.edu/indiv/b/bellonc/fall14/117/kantsuicide.pdf">Maria von Herbert's Challenge to
Kant</a>"
which is an exchange he had with a devout Kantian, who was looking for
moral guidance about a situation in which she had told the truth (to a
new lover, about the fact that he was not her first) after concealing it
initially. She is distraught, and seeking not so much abstract reasoning
as guidance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Herbert writes that she has lost her love, that her heart is
shattered, that there is nothing left to make life worth living, and
that Kant's moral philosophy hasn't helped a bit. Kant's reply is
to suggest that the love is deservedly lost, that misery is an
appropriate response to one's own moral failure, and that the really
interesting moral question here is the one that hinges on a subtle but
necessary scope distinction: the distinction between telling a lie and
failing to tell the truth, between saying 'not-p', and not saying
'p'. Conspicuously absent is an acknowledgement of Herbert's more
than theoretical interest in the question: is suicide compatible with
the moral law?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After several letters in exchange she does, in fact, commit suicide.
While I don't think it's entirely fair to blame Kant for this outcome, I
think his behaviour throughout definitely doesn't suggest he has any
practical insight into how to be a good person.</p>
<h3>Postscript</h3>
<p>The reason this draft got abandoned is pretty clear to me right now because
I was literally in the process of writing it when I abandoned it: I just
don't want to write about ethics right now. I'm tired and grumpy and depressed,
and this whole subject makes that worse rather than better, because I don't
have the energy for a proper righteous anger which is the actual useful emotion
that can drive me to write about ethics. I'm going to go find something more fun
to write about.</p>
