<p>Historically speaking, I hate podcasts. I could tell you all sorts of reasons why they don't work for me as a medium - auditory processing issues, the fact that I don't really like receiving information in a spoken format, etc.</p>
<p>I've also listened to a lot of podcasts in the last week, and it turns out all of those reasons were wrong, and the actual reason that I didn't like podcasts was that I didn't own wireless headphones.</p>
<p>It turns out that I think podcasts as a medium are <em>fine</em>. They're not great. I very much don't think they're the ideal medium for many things. But there's a lot of good information available in podcast form, so by picking out the ones that work best for me it's relatively easy to get reasonable benefit out of podcasts.</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of that benefit though two things need to hold true:</p>
<ol>
<li>There can't be something I'd rather be doing with that time.</li>
<li>The cost of listening to the podcast has to be smaller than the benefit, otherwise listening to it is a net negative.</li>
</ol>
<p>So for example for (1) podcasts are a good thing to listen to in otherwise "dead" time. e.g. doing chores, during exercise, etc. because they're a good thing for occupying attention then that I wouldn't otherwise be using if that's what I want. This was always true and the benefits of them for that were always present.</p>
<p>But also listening to podcasts on speakers or wired headphones is just that little bit too annoying. Wired headphones to a phone in my pocket during exercise is very annoying - it constrains my movement, there's a risk of the headphones being pulled out, etc. The result was that prior to having wireless headphones it was always just a little bit too irritating for me to listen to podcasts.
As a result, having wireless headphones takes the cost-benefit of podcasts from mildly negative to mildly positive.</p>
<p>This, it turns out, is actually a bigger deal than it sounds, because once the cost-benefit analysis is positive I can start to properly get into it. I've even (gasp) <em>listened to podcasts on wired headphones</em> and it was mostly fine, because I'd already done the work to get into it. So I think in the end the cost-benefit analysis of podcasts will be moderately positive - still not my favourite medium, but something I get a fair bit out of it.</p>
<p>None of my original objections were <em>wrong</em> exactly - they're still all things that I expect mean that podcasts will never be my favourite thing, but they were slightly missing the point because what I needed was to overcome a trivial irritation that I didn't realise was there rather than to make podcasts work better for me.</p>
