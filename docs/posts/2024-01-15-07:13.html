<p>This isn’t exactly an abandoned draft, in that it’s more or less
complete as it is, but it’s pulled out of an old Google doc and I wanted
it to be somewhere more permanent and visible.</p>
<hr/>
<p>There is a core to my self-work that I struggle to articulate and
that end up mostly showing up as empty space that I write around. I’d
like to articulate these, with a particular focus on providing clear
statements of belief that are easy for others to disagree with.</p>
<p>Many of these probably require deeper articulation, I am trying to
resist the urge to articulate them. If there is one that you’d like to
discuss, I’m happy to elaborate as much as you need.</p>
<p>By self-work I mean “things that are sort of like therapy”. Anything
that is designed to in some way change your experience of yourself as a
person, your emotional responses, etc.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You can, and probably should, change your nature as a person.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>“Self-acceptance” in the sense of not constantly beating yourself up
is important and you should do that one.</li>
<li>“Self-acceptance” in the sense that you’re fine as you are and don’t
need to change is bad for you and bad for others.</li>
<li>You can get better at things that matter with you.</li>
<li>Things that make you unhappy or hurt others are problems, and you
can likely fix them or work around them.</li>
<li>Very little of the things that you think of as inherent features of
yourself are actually immutable. If you want to change or compensate for
them you probably can.
<ol type="i">
<li>But it’s sometimes going to be a lot of work.</li>
<li>And sometimes you’re better off just leaning into them.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>What you do matters.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>People will evaluate you based on your actions and they are right to
do so.</li>
<li>Self-work fundamentally needs to start with acting in the
world.</li>
<li>It is important to change how you think and feel, but it is more
important to change what you do and change the others in support of
that.</li>
<li>By this I mean change <em>now</em>, not later when you’re done
healing.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Self-work can and should be directed towards becoming a morally
better person.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Without this, it is doomed to fail.</li>
<li>Attempting “ethics-free” self work will likely make you a morally
worse person.</li>
<li>One of the central links between self-work and ethics is your
relationship with guilt.</li>
<li>Becoming a morally better person does not usually mean feeling
guiltier.</li>
<li>Feeling easily overwhelmed with guilt is in fact a moral
failing.</li>
<li>Never feeling guilt is also a moral failing.
<ol type="i">
<li>Either you’ve suppressed the feeling of guilt, which means you can’t
tell when you’re doing a bad thing.</li>
<li>Or you’re over-scrupulously avoiding doing anything that makes you
feel guilty, in which case you are ineffective.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Conversely, ethics is fundamentally grounded in self-work.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>It is useless to ask what you should do in the abstract, because the
most important ethical question is “How do I become the sort of person
who does that?”</li>
<li>Making yourself miserable in the pursuit of ethics probably in the
long run produces worse results than learning how to be happy being a
good person.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Community building is vitally important for both self-work and
ethical development.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Self-work is fundamentally interpersonal, because being a person is
fundamentally in relationship to others.</li>
<li>If you do not have a community supporting your self-work you will
fail.</li>
<li>If you are leading such a community, your self-work needs to at
least be partly directed to being the sort of person who can lead a
community, or your community will fail and it will be your fault.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Moral realism is clearly fake and distracts from the actual role
of realism in ethics.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Ethics shape actions and actions have consequences.</li>
<li>Ethics shapes relationships and relationships shape people.</li>
<li>There is no objective point of view for ethics. Ethics starts from
subjects and their relationships to others.</li>
<li>A core feature of ethics is “alliance building” - I behave this way
because you agree to also behave in a complementary way.</li>
<li>But ethics goes beyond alliance building because of the way group
norms shape people. It’s not just about building alliances but about
<em>becoming the sort of person with whom explicit alliances are not
needed</em>.</li>
<li>Moral language is in one sense just expressing a personal
preference, but these preferences are not devoid of content, they are
rooted in consequences. e.g. engineering has many ethical judgements
around competence and care that are ultimately rooted in preferences
like “It is bad when bridges fall down”.</li>
<li>When we use moral language we are expressing something that is more
than personal but less than fully objective - “X is good (bad)” means
something like “according to the sort of people who I would consider
good, X is (un)desirable, usually based on its outcomes, but sometimes
something intrinsic about it.”</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Ethics is fundamentally about conflict in the Schelling sense -
the best thing for me is not the best thing for you and vice versa, but
there is an outcome where we cooperate that is better for each of us
than not cooperating.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Contra Schelling, we change our values each time we cooperate. By
cooperating with you we build trust and love, and I value your wellbeing
more, and vice versa, and this lowers the level of conflict because a
good outcome for the other is also a good outcome for us.</li>
<li>By repeatedly cooperating we become the sort of people who value
cooperating.</li>
<li>It is also important to value not cooperating with people who don’t
cooperate. Altruistic punishment when someone behaves selfishly is an
important part of this sort of interaction.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Judging people is good and is an important form of altruistic
punishment.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Many people fall short of their own standards, and it is right and
proper to note that and think less well of them for that.</li>
<li>You should have standards for other people that are at least as
stringent as “Does not fail by their own standards”. e.g. Someone not
treating others as well as you feel they deserve, regardless of whether
they agree with you.</li>
<li>This judgement does not require an objective morality to be useful
and important. These are judgements by <em>your</em> moral
standards.</li>
<li>These moral standards are how you decide what sort of person to
be.</li>
<li>These moral standards are also how you decide what sort of
relationships to have.</li>
<li>In many ways those are the same thing.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Helping people is good.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>I think most people are reasonably altruistic and will feel good if
they help others, and that if this is not the case they probably have
unlearned altruism somewhere along the way.</li>
<li>Regardless of whether you are intrinsically altruistic, being in a
community that helps others is selfishly better than being in a
community where people don’t help each other.</li>
<li>One of the ways you should help others is to help them live up to
their own standards.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Punishing people is good.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>When people fall short of your ethical standards, you can and should
make them experience consequences for that.</li>
<li>By default this shouldn’t go much further than expressing
disapproval and maybe downgrading the relationship.</li>
<li>This is how you express your preferences for what sort of person to
be in community with.</li>
<li>Sometimes this will result in breaking the relationship. This is a
failure, possibly a big one, but it is usually better than not having
attempted correction, and often better than many “successes”
(e.g. having to put a huge amount of work into fixing a relatively
unimportant relationship).</li>
<li>For severe ethical failures it can and should go further (call outs,
getting them fired, reporting for crimes, etc. In some cases physical
violence may be appropriate though I’m not personally a fan)</li>
<li>Without punishment for transgression of shared norms, communities
die.</li>
<li>Ideally punishment goes hand in hand with helping - “I will hold you
to high standards and help you achieve them” but this isn’t always
possible.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Competence is a moral issue.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>It’s no good having good intentions if you won’t put in the work to
be able to act on them.</li>
<li>Helping people learn to competently act on your shared ethics is one
of the points of communities.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Taking responsibility is good.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Bad things happen in part because people don’t stop them.</li>
<li>People are over-focused on <em>not being blamed for bad
things</em>.</li>
<li>People should focus more on <em>not wanting bad things to
happen</em>.</li>
<li>It is definitely possible to take too much responsibility but most
people do not take enough.</li>
<li>This will sometimes result in you being blamed more (because you got
involved and bad things still happen) and being OK with that is one of
the reasons you need to be comfortable with guilt if you are to be more
ethical.</li>
<li>A common failure mode of this is feeling responsible for things
going badly without actually doing anything to stop them from going
badly. This is strictly worse than not feeling responsible.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Thinking about things is good.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>A lot of people in self-work space have had a very disordered
relationship with thinking in the past and so have decided that thinking
is bad. This makes about as much sense as “I was repeatedly punching
myself in the face, so I cut off my hands to stop myself doing that”.
Just stop hitting yourself, idiot.</li>
<li>You shouldn’t ignore your feelings when thinking about things
(you’re not doing very good thinking if you are), and you shouldn’t
think to the exclusion of action, but thinking is an essential part of
the acting/feeling/thinking cognitive triangle.</li>
<li>Done well, thinking is fun.</li>
<li>Part of why people don’t like thinking about things verbally is that
they are conflict averse. If you express your thoughts too clearly then
people can disagree with them.</li>
<li>Rumination is not a central example of thinking, and is an example
of the thinking/feeling part of the triangle going wrong together. You
can often break out of rumination by doing thinking better - e.g. by
writing down your thoughts as clearly as you can.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Health is heterogenous</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>There is a sort of “perfectly spherical idealised human in a vacuum”
generic version of health that a lot of spiritual and therapeutic
practices try to push you towards. This is probably bad for you.</li>
<li>The healthy versions of two different people will often look very
different from each other.</li>
<li>It is possible to have a very healthy life that is dominated by
intellectual pursuits.</li>
<li>It is possible to have a very healthy life that is dominated by
physical pursuits.</li>
<li>It is likely that the optimal healthy life for you involves more of
the generic version of health than you are naturally inclined to
(e.g. more physical activity, more intellectual activity).</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Health is not mandatory.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>A healthy life is often something you should be pursuing, but it may
not be achievable.</li>
<li>Often it will be achievable but you correctly choose not to
prioritise it - it’s too much work, it’s in conflict with other
important things.</li>
<li>Even if it’s achievable, it may take a long time to achieve.</li>
<li>Also the world is better with broken people in it. Many of the most
important changes in modern history have come from people who are
clearly emotionally unhealthy, and who have given their lives to some
overriding obsession and made the world a vastly better place as a
result because e.g. they invented half of the vaccines we use today, or
popularised stainless steel. Maybe any given one of their lives would be
better if they were perfectly emotionally healthy, but their lives would
be worse if the <em>others</em> were perfectly emotionally healthy.</li>
<li>Even to the degree that you treat working towards health as
normatively desirable, nobody is there yet, and punishing people for not
being perfectly healthy already is unlikely to achieve the desired
result.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Allowing for heterogeneity is important.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>This is because people are heterogenous and don’t magically become
homogenous because you don’t approve of that.</li>
<li>Many people cannot and will not conform to your ideal of how people
should be, and you need to be able to coexist with them without a state
of total war.</li>
<li>Ideally you should be able to form friendships with people who are
very different from you (although not all differences are possible, or
desirable, to form friendships across)</li>
<li>You should certainly be able to support people who are very
different from you.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Exclusive communities are important</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Communities should be more homogenous than the general population.
It’s important to have communities of people who are in some sense like
you.</li>
<li>These communities should have a degree of gate keeping to them,
where people who do not fit the target demographic of the community are,
if not outright excluded, at least expected to expend more effort
fitting in.</li>
<li>In particular these communities establish common knowledge within
them, and it is reasonable to expect people who do not share that common
knowledge to acquire it in order to participate.</li>
<li>Communities also allow people to establish norms that would not work
in the broader world. This can include both stricter norms of good
behaviour, and also weaker norms in which behaviour that would not be
tolerated between strangers is permissible.</li>
<li>One of the functions of such communities is supporting people who
struggle with the broader world. Ideally by helping them navigate it
better, but in extreme cases by sheltering them from it and providing
them an environment in which they can nevertheless contribute.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Loyalty is important</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>People adapt norms for low-context low-trust environments to their
private relationships, and this makes them bad people.</li>
<li>A prior relationship with someone is in fact a reason to maintain
that relationship and treat it as valuable and give them more leeway and
benefit of the doubt.</li>
<li>If you’re not prepared to do that, you cannot maintain healthy
relationships.</li>
<li>This does not mean that you should take arbitrary shit from people
you are in relationship with, but it does mean that by being in that
relationship it is reasonable to expect a certain degree of
collaboration in fixing the problems with it.</li>
<li>There is a degree of relationship failure past which this is not
reasonable, but that degree has to be pretty severe or chronic before
you break off the relationship.</li>
<li>Because loyalty is important, treating other people’s loyalties as
important is important. Just because you would not form a relationship
with someone does not mean you should punish other people for
maintaining such a relationship.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Disagreement and conflict are good and important (disclaimer:
This section is something that I am currently still sorting my shit out
on. I’m not actually good at it).</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>One of the advantages of a high trust relationship is that it should
be robust enough to support disagreement.</li>
<li>One advantage of a low importance relationship is that if the
disagreement breaks it that’s no big deal.</li>
<li>Disagreement clarifies your thinking, and thinking is good.</li>
<li>It also is the basis for understanding and improving your shared
norms.</li>
<li>If we cannot disagree, we cannot find the places where we
agree.</li>
<li>Disagreement is foundational in being able to orient towards good
together.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="afterword">Afterword</h1>
<p>This feels unsatisfyingly lacking in an ending that pulls everything
together, but I think that’s part of the point of writing it - I still
haven’t figured out how to pull all of this together. I still think it’s
mostly correct and important though.</p>
