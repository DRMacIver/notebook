<h1 id="standardised-facts">Standardised Facts</h1>
<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZB2wmE">Seeing Like a State</a> by
James C. Scott, page 80:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>State simplifications have at least five characteristics that deserve
emphasis. Most obviously, state simplifications are observations of only
those aspects of social life that are of official interest. They are
<em>interested</em>, utilitarian facts. Second, they are also nearly
always written (verbal or numerical) <em>documentary</em> facts. Third,
they are typically <em>static</em> facts. Fourth, most stylized state
facts are also <em>aggregate</em> facts. Aggregate facts may be
impersonal (the density of transportation networks) or simply a
collection of facts about individuals (employment rates, literacy rates,
residence patterns). Finally, for most purposes, stateofficials need to
group citizens in ways that permit them to make a collective assessment.
Facts that can be aggregated and presented as averages or distributions
must therefore by <em>standardized</em> facts. However unique the actual
circumstances of the various individuals who make up the aggregate, it
is their sameness or, more precisely, their differences along a
standardized scale or continuum that are of interest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a very interesting passage that I think I probably just
nodded and skimmed over when first reading this book. I find that often
the random page approach is a good way of highlighting such
passages.</p>
<p>I don’t have a huge amount to say about this passage right now
(because I’m ill and it’s hot and as a result I am quite stupid today)
but I feel like it’s especially relevant right now during the COVID-19
epidemic, where we’re seeing a lot of this sort of thing. Death rates,
hospitalisation rates, etc. are very much an example of standardised
facts, and are eliding a lot of the weird and very unpleasant ways in
which people’s COVID-19 symptoms differ.</p>
