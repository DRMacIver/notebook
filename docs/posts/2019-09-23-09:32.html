<p>Advance warning as this seems to be getting some attention: Please
remember that this is my notebook blog where I just post random shitty
things that are not fully thought out. Don’t expect anything amazing
and/or well justified out of things posted here.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here’s a trick I figured out a while ago and have yet to deploy in
anger because it’s so far outside my wheelhouse (sometimes I tackle
problems I know I won’t be able to solve just to see if anything
interesting falls out and/or to learn more about the research in that
area). As far as I can tell this is novel to me - I’ve read a bunch of
the relevant research, and there are recent papers that should have used
this trick if it were known. I should probably write a paper about it
but, well, haven’t. I’m almost certain it’s not revolutionary in any
meaningful sense, but it does seem to be a nicer approach than similar
things I’ve seen in the literature, and it might be an interesting
incremental improvement on part of the problem.</p>
<p>SAT, the boolean satisfiability problem, is the canonical NP-hard
problem. <code>#SAT</code> is the canonical worse than NP hard problem.
Rather than finding out if a set of formulae is satisfiable, you want to
find out how many satisfying assignments it has (or, in the version I
prefer, the probability of a uniform at random assignment satisfying it
- these are obviously equivalent by just multiplying by <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of variables, but the
nice thing about this is that it is not affected by adding extra “free”
variables that don’t appear in the formulae).</p>
<p>This is obviously at least as hard as SAT because SAT is equivalent
to the number of satisfying assignments being non-zero, but in fact it
is <em>much</em> harder than SAT, both in the complexity sense (assuming
modest “these complexity classes we’re pretty sure are inequivalent
really are” assumptions. Certainly <span class="math inline">\(P \neq
NP\)</span> is enough), and also in the sense that most of the tricks
used to make SAT-solving fast don’t work for SAT-counting because they
involve aggressively pruning the search space. e.g. one thing you do in
a SAT solver is that whenever a variable appears only negated or never
negated in formulae, you can unconditionally set it to a compatible
value to prune out all the clauses it appears in. With model counting
you need to consider both values.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out there is a trick that lets you speed up model
counting in some circumstances. It doesn’t speed things up massively in
all circumstances by any means, but in situations where the problem has
a nice underlying structure it can have a huge impact by cutting down
the problem size significantly.</p>
<p>The way it works is by calculating things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <em>backbone</em> of the problem - the set of literals that will
always be assigned true in any satisfying assignment.</li>
<li>The <em>literal equivalences</em> of the problem - an equivalence
relationship over literals such that every equivalent pair of literals
will have the same value in any satisfying assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Combining these you can significantly reduce the complexity of the
problem by merging all equivalent literals, assigning the backbone to
true, and computing a reduced version of the problem. Every variable in
original is either:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Forced (it is a backbone element, or is equivalent to some literal
of strictly smaller variable number)</li>
<li>Free (it is not equivalent to any strictly smaller variable number
and does not appear in the reduced problem, so its value is
irrelevant)</li>
<li>Uniquely determined by an assignment of the reduced problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore the probability of an assignment satisfying the clauses is
<span class="math inline">\(2^{-k}\)</span> times the probability of an
assignment satisfying the reduced problem, where <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is the number of forced variables.</p>
<p>If the reduced problem is much smaller than the original problem,
which it often will be, this make model counting tractable in cases
where it was previously intractable.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can use this to speed up random sampling, because you
can randomly sample by generating a random sample from the reduced
problem, assigning all forced variables based on that, and uniformly at
random assigning all free variables.</p>
<p>So how do we do this? Partition refinement!</p>
<p>We can simultaneously calculate both the backbone and the literal
equivalence with at most <span class="math inline">\(n + 1\)</span> SAT
queries, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of
variables, as follows.</p>
<p>We maintain three data structures:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure">union/find</a>
data structure for keeping track of merges, modified so that it
understands the negation relationship (i.e. if <span class="math inline">\(x \tilde y\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(\neg x \tilde \neg y\)</span>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_refinement">partition
refinement</a> data structure for keeping track of candidate literals
for merging, using the literal with the smallest variable number as the
canonical representative of a partition.</li>
<li>A set of literals that might be members of the backbone.</li>
</ol>
<p>We initialise the partition refinement data structure with the set of
all literals (note: Not all variables, it’s important to contain
negations too - a variable might be equivalent to the negation of
another variable). We initialise the backbone with the set of all
literals.</p>
<p>Every time we calculate a new assignment for our clauses we:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Update the partition refinement to be compatible with the
assignment, so that every member of the same partition takes the same
value in that assignment.</li>
<li>We intersect the backbone set with it, so that only literals which
are assigned true in this assignment remain in the backbone.</li>
</ol>
<p>To start with, calculate a single satisfying assignment for the
clauses, and update in the above way.</p>
<p>Now, for each variable <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, in
increasing variable number order, do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We look it up in the partition refinement data structure to get the
canonical representative of its partition, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(a =
b\)</span> then stop and do nothing for this variable (this will always
be where we stop for variable <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>).</li>
<li>If it is not, look for a satisfying assignment to the problem with
the addition of the clauses <span class="math inline">\(a \vee
b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\neg a \vee \neg b\)</span>.
These extra clauses force <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> to be assigned distinct values.
<ol type="1">
<li>If there is such an assignment, update the backbone and equivalence
as above.</li>
<li>If on the other hand there is no such assignment, merge <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> in our union/find data structure.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>At the end of this process, the potential backbone will either be
empty, or every element of it will be equivalent. If it is non-empty
pick an arbitrary element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> of the
backbone set and add <span class="math inline">\(\neg a\)</span> to the
clauses temporarily and look for an assignment to that. If there is one,
the problem has no backbone. If there is not one, the current candidate
backbone set is the actual backbone of the problem.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will have exactly the literal equivalence
relationship in the union/find data structure: For every pair of
literals, either we will have proven they can be distinct by
demonstrating this with an assignment, or that they cannot, by finding
that there is no satisfying assignment.</p>
<p>In addition to this core algorithm there are a bunch of good tricks
you can do to speed it up by avoiding making SAT queries where the
answer is more obvious.</p>
<p>The first, is that there’s a nice way of precomputing a lot of the
equivalences from the 2-SAT structure of the problem, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm">Tarjan’s
algorithm</a> for finding strongly connected components of the graph.
Create a graph where the nodes are literals, and for every clause <span class="math inline">\(a \vee b\)</span>, add edges <span class="math inline">\(\neg a \to b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\neg b \to a\)</span>. Now compute the strongly
connected components of the graph, and merge each strongly connected
component together (because if <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are in the same component
then we know that each implies the other so they must be equivalent). If
this results in any merges, replace any literals in the problem that
have been merged. If this results in any new 2-clauses, repeat this
process until there are no more merges.</p>
<p>Additionally, we can partially compute the backbone as we go. As well
as maintaining a set of backbone candidates, we can also maintain a set
of things that are definitely in the backbone, by just running the unit
propagation part of a SAT solver: We maintain a standard data structure
where we keep track of two watched literals for each clause. Whenever we
merge, we update the watches for the replaced literal. If this results
in any new units, we run unit propagation, add every resulting literal
to a known backbone set, and mark the relevant variables as forced and
thus skippable in our iteration.</p>
<p>You can also use unit propagation to speed up the merge step in a
common case by using <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-07-03-09:50.html">a
trick I’ve described before</a>. By making a version of the watched
literals data structure that does a lazy copy, you can easily calculate
what the resulting set of units would be if you added a clause <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to the current clauses. Thus when
testing whether <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are equivalent, you can first start by
discovering whether each implies the other through unit propagation
alone (this can also tell you that in fact one or both of them might
always false if unit propagation leads to a contradiction). If this is
the case, you can merge them without doing a SAT query.</p>
<p>Things I should probably do but haven’t:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Bundle this all up as a convenient bit of code. I have some code for
doing this, but it’s all very entangled with a bunch of barely working
code for sampling from SAT instances (barely working because slow. Turns
out the thing that is a major research field is a hard problem who
knew?!)</li>
<li>See if this is interesting enough to people to get a paper out of
it.</li>
</ol>
