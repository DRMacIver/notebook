<p>I was talking about anxiety management a bit on Twitter, and it
occurred to me that it would be useful to write down a bunch of general
principles that I use for understanding emotions.</p>
<p>These principles aren’t necessarily <em>true</em>, but I’ve found
them useful. I’d say that they’re probably… about 90% true. They’re
worth using as defaults for understanding things, but they probably have
some hidden preconditions and missing features that I have not fully
mapped out yet.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>One of the primary features of emotions is a disposition to act in a
particular way.</li>
<li>A disposition to act is not an obligation to act.</li>
<li>These dispositions are experienced, at least in large part, through
your body, so paying attention to your body helps you understand your
emotions.</li>
<li>There are no “bad” emotions, in the sense that there always a
situation where the disposition prompted by the emotion would be
appropriate.</li>
<li>In a given context, an emotional reaction may or may not be
appropriate.</li>
<li>Emotional reactions are learned pattern matching in response to
particular events.</li>
<li>When an emotional reaction is active, you can retrain those patterns
into ones that better suit the situation.</li>
<li>Retraining requires you to acknowledge that the emotion might, in
principle, be a valid reaction in context.</li>
<li>If you ignore an emotion, it will tend to increase in intensity to
get you to act on it.</li>
<li>Learning to act competently on dispositions can improve emotional
experiences.</li>
<li>If an emotion is debilitating or otherwise interferes with your
life, that’s often a sign of some sort of dysregulation in how you are
managing it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me unpack each of these.</p>
<h3 id="emotions-as-dispositions-towards-action">Emotions as
dispositions towards action</h3>
<p>A disposition in this context is an inclination towards a certain
class of things, an inclination to act in a particular way.</p>
<p>When you are angry, it is because you are being prompted to act
angrily. You are getting ready to have a fight, and you are orienting
yourself towards actions that are useful for that.</p>
<p>Some people (e.g. Antonio Damasio I think) argue that emotions
<em>are</em> these dispositions. I’m somewhat agnostic on this question,
in that I think our use of the word “emotion” is variable enough that
it’s not clear to me that “What are emotions?” is a well-defined
question, and any attempt to promote it as a definition is probably a
lost cause. However, regardless of what theory of emotion we end up
with, understanding the dispositions associated with an emotion is key
to understanding that emotion.</p>
<p>Here are some other examples of disposition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anxiety might dispose you to reducing the uncertainty in a
situation.</li>
<li>Fear might dispose you to getting out of a situation.</li>
<li>Guilt might dispose you towards repairing some damage you’ve
done.</li>
<li>Curiousity might dispose you to learning more about something.</li>
<li>Contentment might dispose you towards luxuriating in something
you’re enjoying.</li>
<li>Delight might dispose you towards immersing yourself in a particular
activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Side note: I realised while writing this that it was much easier for
me to figure out what the dispositions associated with negative emotions
are. Given that part of my goals right now are to improve my experience
of positive emotions, I find that very interesting)</p>
<h3 id="dispositions-are-not-obligations">Dispositions are not
obligations</h3>
<p>When you get angry, you are not being <em>forced</em> to act angrily.
You can feel angry without acting angry (although people will probably
be able to tell that you are angry. This is not necessarily bad). But
the emotion of anger includes, as a key feature, a dsposition towards
angry action - you are inclined to shout at someone, to attack them,
etc.</p>
<p>An important skill in emotion management is to acquire a bit of a
separation between disposition and action. To pause and say “Actually, I
know that emotionally this is the way I am disposed to act, but
<em>should</em> I do that?”</p>
<p>Importantly, this is not <em>suppressing</em> the emotion. That has
to be an honest question, to which it is possible that the answer is
allowed to be yes.</p>
<h3 id="dispositions-are-experienced-bodily">Dispositions are
experienced bodily</h3>
<p>We act in the world through our body, so experiencing a disposition
is, in large part, experiencing an arrangement of our body (including
our senses) to act. If we are disposed to fight, we will feel our body
tensing to fight. If we are curious about something, we might feel our
attention physically drawn to it.</p>
<p>Learning this is basically what <a href="https://focusing.org/">Focusing</a> is - learning to pay attention
to your bodily dispositions towards particular actions, as a preliminary
step towards understanding the emotional reactions that underly
them.</p>
<h3 id="there-are-no-bad-emotions">There are no bad emotions</h3>
<p>We have these dispositions because <em>they are useful</em>. If you
are experiencing a disposition, there are circumstances under which that
disposition is the right one. If you feel afraid, that is not bad in and
of itself, because there are circumstances under which a disposition to
get out of the situation is a good thing.</p>
<p>We (for some suitably culture specific value of we) tend to think of
negative emotions as being bad for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They might frequently be inappropriately deployed (anger).</li>
<li>They might be overused, or misused, against us (guilt, shame)</li>
<li>We might have unhelpful habits built up around them (anxiety)</li>
</ul>
<p>These all give us a bad relationship with a particular emotion, but
they primarily result in a conflation between the disposition, the
situation prompting it, and the actions it prompts. The disposition
<em>in and of itself</em> is neither bad nor good, and sometimes it will
be exactly the right thing to have.</p>
<h3 id="emotions-may-promote-inappropriate-action">Emotions may promote
inappropriate action</h3>
<p>Suppose you say something, and I mishear you and think you have
insulted at me, and I respond in kind, and a fight results. That is an
example of an inappropriate reaction - I have misunderstood the
situation, I have acted in a way that is (arguably) appropriate <em>if
the situation were as I understood it</em>.</p>
<p>This is what an inappropriate emotional reaction is like: You have
responded with a disposition because the situation makes you think it is
the appropriate one, but you are in some way mistaken about the
situation.</p>
<h3 id="emotional-reactions-are-learned-pattern-matching">Emotional
reactions are learned pattern-matching</h3>
<p>Generally your emotional reactions are based on very simplified
models of the world. For example, social anxiety might be a learned
reaction that <em>all</em> social situations are unsafe and you have to
be on high alert and monitor for threats. A bad experience with men
might cause a disposition to be on your guard around <em>all</em>
men.</p>
<p>You don’t necessarily have access to these simplified models. There’s
not necessarily a conscious part of your brain that goes “This is a
party. Parties are THE WORST. Therefore I now decide to be anxious.” -
the anxiety generally starts preverbally, and the thoughts come after
(although the thoughts can in turn promote action).</p>
<p>It can be useful to think of your mind having a subsystem that is
“the bit that decides to be anxious” (or angry, or delighted, or…) which
is monitoring the world for certain features and putting you into the
particular disposition when its conditions are met. The subsystem is not
necessarily particularly intelligent, and you have a lot of these
subsystems going on so they don’t necessarily have a lot of resources
available to them, so they’re trying to do the best they can on a
limited budget, and they sometimes get it wrong.</p>
<h3 id="active-emotional-reactions-can-be-relearned">Active emotional
reactions can be relearned</h3>
<p>Because emotions are learned pattern matching, changing your
emotional reactions is a matter of relearning that pattern matching. You
want to take the subsystem and get it to respond better in some
circumstances.</p>
<p>This seems to be <em>much</em> easier when the emotional subsystem is
activated. I don’t want to say you <em>can’t</em> do it when it’s not
activated (and certainly you can lay useful groundwork for this
process), but it’s not something I’ve been able to do.</p>
<p>“Activated” doesn’t necessarily mean when you’re in the situation in
question (although I do often use it there) - it can through a process
of imagination, talking it out, thinking about the prompting
situation.</p>
<p>Once you’re in this state, you can gently start to question the
premises of the emotional reaction. Draw your attention to certain
aspects of the situation, explore whether this is the right disposition
for you to take in this context.</p>
<p>For example, social anxiety can be relearned around people you have
much stronger evidence are safe. The level of anxiety you experience
when talking to a close friend should be lower than the level of anxiety
you have talking to someone at a party, and drawing your attention to
the things that make it so can help relearn the emotional reaction.</p>
<h3 id="ignoring-an-emotion-intensifies-it">Ignoring an emotion
intensifies it</h3>
<p>One thing that <em>doesn’t</em> seem to work is to try to suppress
and ignore the emotion. Emotions are there to dispose you to act, so
will often rise to the level of intensity required to get you to act. If
you repeatedly suppress an emotion and pretend it’s not there, it will
tend to get worse over time rather than better.</p>
<h3 id="relearning-starts-with-accepting-the-emotion-in-principle">Relearning
starts with accepting the emotion in principle</h3>
<p>Because ignoring the emotion doesn’t work, and because emotions are
dispositions to act, you need to acknowledge it as potentially
valid.</p>
<p>What this means is that you need to start from the premise that if
this is the correct disposition to have in this scenario, you would act
on it. If you’re actually being attacked, it’s OK to be angry and act
angrily. If there’s genuine risk in the situation, it’s OK to be anxious
and act to reduce that risk.</p>
<p>Starting from the premise that the emotion <em>might</em> be valid,
and exploring the question of whether it is, allows you to work with
yourself rather than creating internal conflict, and maximises your
chance of successfully retraining the emotion.</p>
<h3 id="learning-to-act-competently-on-dispositions">Learning to act
competently on dispositions</h3>
<p>One of the big problems we often end up with emotions is that we’re
not very good at acting on them not in the sense that we ignore them,
but we act on them in ways that don’t actually improve the
situation.</p>
<p>Anxiety and guilt are two big examples of this. If anxiety causes us
to panic and make the situation worse, we have <em>not</em> reduced the
risk in the situation, so our level of anxiety goes up rather down. If
we feel guilty and avoid the whole situation to avoid feeling that
guilt, we end up feeling more guilty rather than less.</p>
<p>Learning skills in a safe environment (when the emotion is
<em>not</em> active) that we can apply in these cases helps us fix this:
If cleaning makes us anxious, creating a safe environment in which to
learn a bit of cleaning skills will help the next time we have cleaning
anxiety. If we feel guilt about a particular situation, talking through
the situation and deciding on some practical steps you can take to
improve it (or indeed deciding that you don’t need to feel guilty about
it at all).</p>
<p>The ideal situation is that we have the emotional responses that
dispose us to act in the right way in the right context, and learning to
act in the right way is a key part of that that we can manage separately
from the emotional responses themselves.</p>
<h3 id="debilitating-emotions-are-probably-dysregulation">Debilitating
emotions are probably dysregulation</h3>
<p>If your emotional reactions are so strong that they prevent you from
acting, something has gone wrong (except in the rare specific cases
where preventing you from acting is what they’re <em>supposed</em> to
do, as in the freeze trauma response). Emotions are dispositions towards
actions, but if those dispositions get too overwhelmingly intense they
may stop you from acting.</p>
<p>I don’t have too much experience with this side of things (my
problems are, if anything, at the opposite end of the spectrum - I don’t
tend to have intense enough emotional reactions), so I’m wary of
offering too much advice in this space. I think all of the above
principles are still likely to be useful to you, but I’d recommend also
looking into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy">Dialectical
Behavioural Therapy</a> and possibly the literature on cPTSD. <a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/trauma-and-cptsd-101/">Meg-John
Barker’s piece on the subject</a> is good, and provides pointers to
further literatures.</p>
<p>(The literature on cPTSD may also be useful even if you
<em>don’t</em> experience overwhelming emotions. Certainly I’ve found it
so.)</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3>
<p>These are the principles underlying most of my emotion work right
now. You can read some more of my thoughts on the subject in:</p>

reactions as legacy code</a></li>

emotions are valid but probably wrong</a></li>

fix anxiety triggers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to read more qualified people’s thoughts on the subject
the books I’ve read that are most directly relevant to this are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2AUQ2vW">Descartes’ Error</a> by Antonio
Damasio is largely theoretical but is good for understanding the
mind/body link.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Mnm1Hx">Focusing</a> by Eugene Gendlin
helps understand how to use a sense of your own body to understand your
emotions. People recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/3gMG3cB">The Power
of Focusing</a> as a better introduction but I haven’t got around to
reading it yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3gQUdcT">Unlocking the emotional brain</a>
is in theory the source of a lot of my work on retraining emotions, but
I must admit I never get around to reading it. I just read <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/book-summary-unlocking-the-emotional-brain">Kaj
Sotala’s review of it</a>, went “Oh right”, and immediately incorporated
it into my own practice.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Axf1W0">The Emotion Machine</a> by Marvin
Minsky was useful for thinking about how the mind organises itself
around resources which create dispositions to action. I’m suspicious of
whether the book is actually <em>right</em>, but it’s proven a useful
source of metaphors.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can’t necessarily promise you’ll get the same things out of these
resources that I did - there’s a lot of surrounding additional reading,
discussion, and experimentation, but they’re all good books that I’ve
found quite helpful.</p>
