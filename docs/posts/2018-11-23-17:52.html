<p>I mentioned this system in passing before but thought it would worth noting down explicitly and commenting on some of its reasoning.</p>
<p>When trying to decide whether to do a close reading of a paper I've started using a points based system.
Ideally I should be able to evaluate this score in about 10 minutes of reading maximum.</p>
<p>I ask three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How well written is this paper?</li>
<li>How interesting (to me) is this paper?</li>
<li>How useful (to me) is this paper?</li>
</ul>
<p>Each question gets a score from -1 to 2,
with -1 meaning unusually bad and 2 meaning among the best I've seen recently in that category.
These scores are added together to get a total score for the paper.
A paper with a score of 2 or higher gets read in more detail.</p>
<p>The scoring is slightly odd but basically the reasoning is this gives the following combinations worth reading:</p>
<ul>
<li>One is great, others both neutral or better</li>
<li>One is great, one is good, one is bad</li>
<li>Two are good, remaining neutral</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular a paper has to be doing well on two of these characteristics or amazingly on one of them in order to be worth reading.</p>
<p>While doing the initial casual reading towards, one thing I make sure to do is note anywhere I'm confused and then move on as quickly as possible.
When doing the second reading I start with those points.</p>
