<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZBIVTz">Style: Towards Clarity and
Grace</a> by Joseph M. Williams, page 129:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When someone is thoroughly at home in thinking through a problem, she
can suppress in her prose the metadiscourse that records her thinking,
allowing little or no of the intellectual process to reach the surface
of her prose, or at least to remain the final draft.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coincidentally, <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/writing-to-understand">today’s
newsletter is about the use of writing to understand rather than
communicate</a>. Using writing specifically as a place where all your
thinking goes on the page, and is thereby improved.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a complaint I often have: It’s essentially
impossible to learn to do mathematics by reading research level
mathematics, because research level mathematics is performance of this
form. A proof as presented is almost <em>never</em> a proof as
discovered, because the authors have spent a great deal of time
refining, generalising, and making the process more elegant.
Additionally, it often contains little to no trace of the process that
lead to that discovery, and is presented in an entirely different order
from that which lead to the underlying insights.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that I would really enjoy reading a book that was
just ethnographic studies and interviews of academics, where they talk
about the process that lead to some great papers. Ideally these would be
by embedded ethnographers who had spent some time observing the
academics’ actual research process, to try to offset the tendency to
historical revisionism that we’re all prone to.</p>
