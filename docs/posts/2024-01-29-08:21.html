<p>Consider, if you will, a perfectly flat city laid out in a perfectly
even grid, aligned with the compass directions.</p>
<p>Suppose you are at grid reference (0, 0) and want to be at grid
reference (10, 10). You ask Google maps for a plan. What does it
say?</p>
<p>It will probably tell you something like “Go East 10 blocks, then go
North ten blocks”.</p>
<p>This is somewhat unintuitive but correct. You naturally think that
the shortest path between two points is a straight line and want to do a
sort of diagonal where you go East, then North, then East, then North,
then East, etc. or something like that, but on a grid system this
doesn’t buy you anything because each time you go North or East you
travel exactly one block, so every route you take must be exactly 20
blocks long. There is no route to your destination shorter than 20
blocks.</p>
<p>Also, a human ignoring Google maps will get there sooner than one
following it.</p>
<p>Here is the correct fastest algorithm for getting to your
destination: Every time you are at an intersection, if there is a green
light for going either North or East, and that is a useful direction for
you to take (i.e. if you’re still South of destination and there’s a
North light, or if you’re still West of your destination and there’s an
East light), take it.</p>
<p>Following this algorithm doesn’t reduce your travel distance. It
doesn’t even significantly reduce the amount of time you spend actually
driving. But it <em>significantly</em> shortens your wait times along
the way.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">An interesting feature of this algorithm that I can’t
decide if it is a coincidence or not is that the resulting path will
look a lot closer to the straight line that you might have intuitively
drawn.</span></p>
<p>The thing about this algorithm is that it’s completely outside of
Google Maps’s ability to give you this plan. It’s not just that it’s not
a thing it considers, it’s not a thing that it <em>can</em> consider,
because there’s too much variability to predict exactly when the lights
are going to change on your journey, even if it had precise timing data.
This is however no problem for following the algorithm, because it is
<em>adaptive</em> - it takes into account the information that you have
access to at the time of making the decision but do not have in
advance.</p>
<p>Planning in advance is very useful, but it will always lack access to
this sort of on the ground information, and you can often improve on
purely up front plans by introducing an adaptive element to it like
this..</p>
<p>The flipside of course is that we were able to do this here because
the decisions we confront in navigating a grid are <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-make-easy-decisions">easy</a>.
Trying to make hard decisions adaptively introduces a significant cost
to executing the plan. One of the most important things to decide in
advance is how you are going to make decisions on the fly.</p>
