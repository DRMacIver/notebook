<p>A thing I've been noticing recently is that it's really useful to have compact notation for describing things.
Usually this is equivalent to primivitives + some combinators.</p>
<p>One thing that I think it would be useful to have such a notation for is (greedy) test-case reduction passes.
They combine pretty well, and it makes it useful to discuss various things.</p>
<p>For example, if you have reducers \(A\), \(B\), you can define the reducer \(AB\) which runs \(A\), then
runs \(B\) on its result. You can also define the reducer \(A^+\) which runs \(A\) to a fixed point.</p>
<p>Another interesting combinator is \(/\). \(A / B\) runs \(A\), then runs \(B\) if \(A\) didn't do anything..</p>
<p>There are a bunch of really basic algebraic relations that hold, like composition and \(/\) are associative,
and \((A^+)^+ = A^+\), but not a huge amount beyond that.</p>
<p>A bunch of interesting questions about test-case reduction can be compactly expressed in this notation though.
For example, suppose you want to reduce to something that is a fixed point of both \(A\) and \(B\).
You could do \((AB)^+\), but you could also do \((A^+B^+)^+\), and it's quite natural to do this in some contexts.
My suspicion, which I've yet to verify, is that it's almost never the right thing to do.</p>
<p>You can kinda regard the quadratic mode failure of greedy search as an instance of this problem:
If \(\delta_i\) is the operation that deletes the element at position \(i\), the correct pass to run for greedy deletion is \((\delta_0^+ \ldots \delta_n^+)^+\),
but if you start again at the beginning every time you succeed you are running \((\delta_0 / \ldots / \delta_n)^+\).</p>
