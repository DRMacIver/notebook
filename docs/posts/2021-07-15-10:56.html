<p>I’m going to describe a problem that I have. I have not yet found a
good solution for it, and this is why you are getting a very nominal
post today in which I describe that problem and think out loud about
it.</p>
<p>The problem is this: I start with something small, and then I think
“Oh this is really good, I should do it justice”.</p>
<p>Doing it justice makes it… not small. Often it increases the work of
doing it by a factor of ten or more. Suddenly it becomes a thing that I
need to spent much longer on than I had time allocated for it, and moves
it up a project size category.</p>
<p>In concrete terms what happens is that I now have two pieces that
started out life as notebook posts and are going to be newsletter issues
that I need to finish. They should be pretty easy to finish but I
probably won’t have time to do so prior to the weekend.</p>
<p>Often they languish unfinished. This was very much my problem with
writing papers. It felt like in order to write an academic paper I had
to publish something that was substantially worse than the state of the
art that existed in my head, because in order to get to the point where
it was publishable I either had to stop thinking about the problem
(impossible if I were to be interested enough to finish writing it) or
publish something that I felt was worse than I could have done.</p>
<p>This isn’t really a problem for many things which feel like I can
just snip off a thread. The notebook is good for that, but often I end
up wanting to write things which have a certain minimum size without
which they would end up incomplete.</p>
<p>I think part of the problem here is really not that things become
large, but that I need a better way to work on large projects. The paper
problem felt like a mismatch between the sort of incrementalism I wanted
to do and the sort of incrementalism that academia wanted me to do. The
newsletter issue problem is more manageable, and I think I just need to
get better at managing my draft backlog and allocating more time to
it.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can treat drafts as an inbox problem and apply the <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/triage-your-inboxes">How to
triage your inboxes</a> method to it?</p>
