<p>This started out life as an extended metaphor for how we treat people's support mechanisms in general,
but I think it works pretty well on a literal reading too.</p>
<p>Note that I am essentially able-bodied (minor caveats only), but I did check this post with a cane user before publishing it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A: <a href="http://bactra.org/weblog/569.html">Hey, you over there, the one walking! You're doing it wrong.</a></p>
<p>B: Excuse me?</p>
<p>A: You're using a cane! You shouldn't do that!</p>
<p>B: ...</p>
<p>A: You should be walking with your own two feet, like a normal person!</p>
<p>B: I will fall over if I do that.</p>
<p>A: Have you tried?</p>
<p>B: Yes. I fell over.</p>
<p>A: Maybe you should try harder?</p>
<p>B: That would cause me to fall over harder.</p>
<p>A: You just need more practice! The problem is, you're using the cane as a crutch.</p>
<p>B: Well, technically a cane and a crutch are different assistive devices. You see a crutch-</p>
<p>A: I mean you're using your <em>cane</em> to support your <em>weight</em>.</p>
<p>B: It's more about stability, but yes that's what it's for.</p>
<p>A: You should be using your legs to do that!</p>
<p>B: I literally can't. I have a torn ligament in my ankle. It will not hold my weight properly.</p>
<p>A: That's no excuse. You should fix that then!</p>
<p>B: I am on a waiting list for surgery, yes.</p>
<p>A: Well if you know how to fix it, why are you using that cane?</p>
<p>B: Because I haven't had the surgery yet and I need to walk <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>A: But what if your cane is made with conflict minerals?</p>
<p>B: Uh, is it?</p>
<p>A: I don't know, did you even <em>check</em>?</p>
<p>B: Not really, no. Who made your shoes?</p>
<p>A: (waves hand dismissively) oh who cares about that? <em>Everyone</em> wears shoes. You're wearing shoes. But <em>your cane</em> might be made with conflict minerals, and I don't have one of those.</p>
<p>B: In the grand scheme of things I don't think canes are a significant contributor to global conflict.</p>
<p>A: But it's <em>all</em> of our responsibility to care about these things! You should be more responsible in how you walk.</p>
<p>B: OK. If we're all responsible, would you like to pay for me to be able to have my surgery sooner?</p>
<p>A: No, it's your responsibility to do that too.</p>
<p>B: ...</p>
<p>A: Anyway, have you tried yoga?</p>
