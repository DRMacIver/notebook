<h1 id="a-round-tripping-problem-with-expected-utility-theory">A
round-tripping problem with expected utility theory</h1>
<p>For reasons, I’ve been thinking about subjective expected utility
theory and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">Von
Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem</a> (“the VNM theorem” for short)
recently. I have some significant philosophical objections to subjective
expected utility and I’m going to explore a few of them in a series of
notebook posts. This post is about an interesting thing I noticed while
trying to articulate those objections. I don’t necessarily expect it to
persuade anyone of anything.</p>
<p>The problem is this: The VNM theorem loses information. You cannot
actually reconstruct the original decision procedure from the output of
the VNM theorem, because the VNM theorem’s output isn’t quite what it’s
usually framed as.</p>
<p>The VNM theorem is as follows: Suppose you have a set of outcomes
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O} = \{O_1, \ldots, O_n\}\)</span>.
A lottery <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is a random variable in
<span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{O}\)</span>.</p>
<p>An agent has preferences over lotteries, expressed by a preorder
<span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span> and an indifference
relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>. That is <span class="math inline">\(L \preceq L'\)</span> means that <span class="math inline">\(L'\)</span> is at least as good as <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(L \sim
L'\)</span> means the agent is indifferent between them.</p>
<p>The VNM theorem is that under certain reasonableness conditions, this
preorder must be expressible in terms of a utility function <span class="math inline">\(u: \mathcal{O} \to \mathbb{R}\)</span>, such that
<span class="math inline">\(L \preceq L'\)</span> if and only if
<span class="math inline">\(E(u(L)) \leq E(u(L'))\)</span>. i.e. we
prefer a lottery if it has a higher expected utility, and are
indifferent between two lotteries with the same expected utility.</p>
<p>It’s instructive to sketch the proof of this theorem:</p>
<p>Because we have a total order over outcomes, there is a best outcome
and a worst outcome. Call them <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> respectively. If <span class="math inline">\(B \sim W\)</span> then we’re necessarily
indifferent between all lotteries, so assume <span class="math inline">\(W \prec B\)</span>. Now, consider the family of
lotteries <span class="math inline">\(M_p\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(M_p\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(1 - p\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(M_1
= B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(M_0 = W\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> be some lottery. We must
have <span class="math inline">\(M_0 = W \preceq L \preceq B =
M_1\)</span>. Therefore (by the hypotheses of the theorem) we can find
some <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> in the middle such that
<span class="math inline">\(M_p \sim L\)</span>. Some computation shows
that this number <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> behaves like an
expected value.</p>
<p>Thus the VNM theorem gives us the expected utility of an arbitrary
lottery. Right?</p>
<p>Except, it doesn’t. It guarantees that this expected utility exists,
but it does not actually give us a way to compute it. The hypothesis of
the VNM theorem is that there is some point at which the switchover to
indifference happens, but we are not given an oracle which computes that
probability, only a guarantee of its existence.</p>
<p>Instead what we have to do is turn our oracle for preferences into a
sort of mathematical root finding algorithm to find increasingly fine
grained approximations to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. We
construct a sequence of approximations <span class="math inline">\(q_k
\leq p \leq r_k\)</span> by setting <span class="math inline">\(q_0 =
0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r_0 = 1\)</span>, then to
calculate <span class="math inline">\(q_{k+1}, r_{k+q}\)</span> we set
<span class="math inline">\(s_k = \frac{q_k + r_k}{2}\)</span> and then
asking whether <span class="math inline">\(M_{s_k} \preceq L\)</span>.
If yes, we set <span class="math inline">\(q_{k + 1} = r_k, r_{k + 1} =
s_k\)</span>, if no we set <span class="math inline">\(q_{k + 1} = s_k,
r_{k + 1} = r_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that this process will ever terminate - the
numbers for which it terminates are precisely the dyadic rationals, the
integers divided by some power of two, so for example if <span class="math inline">\(p = \frac{1}{3}\)</span> it will go on forever,
producing increasingly good approximations. You can design other divide
and conquer schemes - there’s nothing special about this particular one
- but they will all have this problem of there being some utility values
that this doesn’t converge to.</p>
<p>(Honesty compels me to admit that this problem goes away if you
insist that probabilities and utilities have to be rational numbers,
because you can design a divide and conquer scheme that just enumerates
all of the rationals between the current bounds. For technical reasons
that I will not go into here I find this a fundamentally unsatisfying
conclusion, but the short version is that the real numbers are a better
approximation to the problems of physical measurement than the rational
numbers are)</p>
<p>Which is fine, in practical terms you will very rarely need to know
your utility to the last decimal place, but the interesting thing to
note is this: Given access to a procedure that provides these
increasingly fine grained approximations to the expected utility, you
cannot actually recreate the original decision procedure with a process
that is guaranteed to terminate.</p>
<p>The problem is this: Suppose we have some procedure that calculates a
relationship <span class="math inline">\(\preceq'\)</span> based on
such converging approximate utilities. We want <span class="math inline">\(\preceq'\)</span> to be identical with <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span>, so lets assume we’ve succeeded
and see if this leads to a contradiction.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be some number where the
process doesn’t terminate and ask whether <span class="math inline">\(M_p \preceq' M_p\)</span> (using the same
<span class="math inline">\(M_p\)</span> as above). If <span class="math inline">\(\preceq'\)</span> agrees with <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span> we will get the correct answer
that <span class="math inline">\(M_p \sim' M_p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, look at how many steps of the approximation you had to compute
in order to get to that point, say <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. This gives us an interval <span class="math inline">\(q_k \leq p \leq r_k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now at this point we decided that <span class="math inline">\(M_p
\sim' M_p\)</span> based on no information other than that <span class="math inline">\(p \in [q_k, r_k]\)</span>. Therefore for any other
<span class="math inline">\(s \in [q_k, r_k]\)</span> we would also
decide that <span class="math inline">\(M_p \sim M_s\)</span> (because
we can’t tell based on what we’ve computed that <span class="math inline">\(p \neq s\)</span>). But in our original
relationship we must have <span class="math inline">\(M_p \prec
M_s\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(M_s \prec M_p\)</span>,
because their utilities are <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> respectively. Therefore we have
failed to recreate <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span> from the
output of the VNM theorem.</p>
<p>Why is this interesting?</p>
<p>Well, mostly it’s interesting because this looks exactly like my
normal objections to the VNM theorem, but normally I justify it on
practical grounds: You run into <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredkin%27s_paradox">Fredkin’s
paradox</a> (a term I’ve only recently learned - I’ve always thought of
this as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass">Buridan’s ass
problem</a>), where the amount of work you have to do to decide goes to
infinity as you approach points of indifference. From a practical
viewpoint where you have all sorts of measurement and approximation
problems, this is (to me) obviously a problem with the theory, which is
generally handwaved away by the setup: The VNM theorem basically starts
by saying “OK so first assume you’re omniscient…” which is what allows
it to start by assuming that you have this decision procedure.</p>
<p>The interesting thing about this result is that the VNM theorem runs
into this problem even on its own terms, without introducing any
additional assumptions of physical reasonableness (unless you count
“cannot run a literally infinite amount of computation”). The VNM
theorem starts from an omniscient decision procedure and constructs a
utility function, but you cannot run that process backwards from the
utility function to such a decision procedure because of precisely the
sorts of limitations that meant that you couldn’t really have
constructed that procedure in the first place.</p>
