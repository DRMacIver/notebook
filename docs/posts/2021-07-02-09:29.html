<p>I’m currently reading a philosophy book, and as a result I am cranky
about definitions. Like everyone who is not a mathematician (or
culturally basically a mathematician, such as a computer scientist or
theoretical physicist), philosophers are very bad at defining their
terms. The key sin of philosophers is that they love doing it anyway,
and think they’re good at it, but are for the most part terrible about
it unless they’ve lucked into learning how to do it well from some
source that wasn’t a bunch of philosophers who think “language games”
meant you were supposed to play language as a competitive sport where
you score points for using words that nobody else understands.</p>
<p>What I mean by “definition” here, is that when you introduce a new
term (or even use an existing term in a specific or unfamilar way), you
need to provide people with the ability to understand your usage of it.
This doesn’t require a precise definition that says exactly what the
term means, like a mathematician would, though if you <em>can</em>
provide such a thing that is often helpful, but it does require you to
introduce enough precision that people can understand what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p>Most people do not put in nearly enough work into defining novel
terms in a way that is usable by the reader. When you introduce a
definition without adequate support, you have essentially put a road
block in the reader’s path until they have sufficiently understood your
definition to proceed. If you do not help them out in doing this, you
have probably lost most of them as a reader, and almost certainly many
of those you retain will misunderstand your point.</p>
<h3 id="what-a-good-definition-is">What a good definition is</h3>
<p>The purpose of a definition is to give people enough to grab on to to
be able to understand your usage of the term. As such, it should explain
the term (see <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/">How
to explain anything to anyone</a>) and give them some material to work
with in developing their understanding on top of that explanation.</p>
<p>A gold standard for definitions contains all of the following
characteristics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The term is well separated from surrounding text rather than buried
somewhere. The mathematical convention is that we typically have a
bolded “<strong>Definition:</strong>” in front of it, often with a
number you can refer back to.</li>
<li>It provides an explanation of <em>why we need the term</em>.</li>
<li>It provides an intuitive handle on the term.</li>
<li>It provides as precise an explanation of what the term means as is
reasonable.</li>
<li>It is accompanied by at least one <em>positive example</em>, an
example of a thing that satisfies the definition, with an explanation of
why it is an example.</li>
<li>It is accompanied by at least one <em>negative example</em>, an
example of a thing that is close to satisfying the definition but
doesn’t, with an explanation of why it is not an example.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of these, the examples are in many ways the most important and the
most overlooked.</p>
<h3 id="an-example-of-a-bad-definition">An example of a bad
definition</h3>
<p>In contrast the way most people do it is they shove a new term
somewhere in the middle of a paragraph, gesture vaguely at what they
mean by it, and then go on to use it in ways that completely fail to
track the limited sense in which they’ve defined it.</p>
<p>The definition that I am currently being cranky about comes from
Albert Borgmann’s is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The early scientific theories of the Western world had both
world-articulating and world-explaining significance. To articulate
something, i.e., to outline and highlight the crucial features of
something is also a kind of explanation. It is the kind of explanation
that can satisfy the request for an explanation of a concrete thing or
event. I will call it deictic explanation to distinguish it from
deductive-nomological or subsumptive explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I am being very very charitable, this just about satisfies (2) and
(4). It explains why we need the term (it distinguishes a type of
explanation that is different from the sort we are considering in the
context of a modern scientific explanation), and it more or less defines
it as being the sort of explanation that you get by outlining and
highlighting th ecrucial features of something. Fair enough.</p>
<p>Anyway, on the very next page this is how the word deictic is
used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They do have deictic power in the sense of delimiting a set of
possible worlds and ruling out certain impossible worlds. We can observe
a similar pattern in the development from alchemy by way of chemistry to
nuclear physics. Alchemy reflected in its laws a definite world of a
limited number of stuffs and transformative forces and processes.
Nuclear physics. being a microtheory, allows for an indefinite number of
molar worlds.</p>
<p>This pattern in the progress of science has no a priori character. It
is an empirical fact that the world can be explained in the powerful
scientific theories that we now have. The pace of the discoveries of
these theories is a matter of historical fact. But given these two
facts, it was inevitable that the deictic power of the sciences waned
and all but vanished. This is not a failure of science. Nor is it the
case that the deictic achievement of the earlier sciences was
unquestionable or unique. Art has always been the supreme deictic
discipline. Art in turn has sometimes been one with philosophy,
religion, and politics; at other times these disciplines have
complemented or competed with one another as disciplines of deictic
explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This subsequent usage <em>very</em> much makes me question whether I
have understood his meaning.</p>
<p>As near as I can tell, “deictic” means something along the lines of
“indexical”, which means something along the lines of “pointing to a
specific thing” (thanks to <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">a
literal banana for explaining this</a>). Something is deictic to the
degree that it concerns a specific thing in all its glory, in contrast
to something being apodeictic. An explanation is deictic to the degree
that it is focused on explaining <em>a particular thing</em> and what is
interesting about it specifically, while it is apodeictic to the degree
that it is focused on explaining <em>a general phenomenon</em> and the
conditions under which it emerges.</p>
<p>Maybe. I can’t tell for sure, because he doesn’t provide me with any
concrete examples to test this. Certainly I would very much not have
thought of philosophy or religion as at all examples of things prone to
deictic explanations. Art I will grant, certainly, and politics
certainly is full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked problems</a>,
which by their nature require attention to the specifics of the unique
thing involved.</p>
<p>All of this confusion would easily have been cleared up with some
examples and a bit more spelling out of his meaning.</p>
<h3 id="an-example-of-a-good-definition">An example of a good
definition</h3>
<p>In contrast, I think the following definition from Bernard Suits’s
“The Grasshopper”, is very good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs
[prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means],
where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less
efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted
just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude]. I also
offer the following simpler and, so to speak, more portable version of
the above: playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome
unnecessary obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has both the precise definition and the intuitive handle on it.
It then goes on for several pages more to investigate how this does and
doesn’t apply to specific examples, which I won’t include here. It
doesn’t have a mathematician’s “<strong>Definition:</strong>” preamble,
but that wouldn’t really fit the style of the book, and it’s still its
own paragraph.</p>
<h3 id="appropriate-levels-of-precision">Appropriate levels of
precision</h3>
<p>In my gold standard for “good definition” I said “It provides as
precise an explanation of what the term means as is reasonable”. The
reason for the “as is reasonable” clause is that it is rarely the case
that one can define something perfectly precisely, at least outside of
the realm of mathematics or constrained rule based environments
(e.g. laws, rituals, games).</p>
<p>In reality many things cannot be this precisely defined, and we need
more example-based (philosophers would say “ostensive”) and sketch
explanations. For example I can’t really define “red” for you, but I can
tell you that red is a colour (hopefully you don’t need me to define
“colour”, because I’d really struggle with this one) and then point at
examples of things that are red and things that are not red until you
get the picture.</p>
<p>This is particularly common when you start talking about people, as
people are reliably messy and complicated, and it becomes hard to
precisely define a term rigorously. That’s fine. We can still talk
usefully about things like “love” without answering the question “What
is love?”, it just requires us to be a bit more careful about how we do
it, and how we use examples. It may also require us to talk around a bit
more about what we do and don’t mean.</p>
<p>For an example of why one might need to do this, a question that came
up in discussion recently is “What does ‘unconditional’ mean in
‘unconditional love’?”. It turned out everyone was using it differently
(e.g. does it refer to how the love would change if circumstances
change, or is it a character of the type of love felt in the moment?).
This is the sort of confusion that comes up in the absence of a
sufficiently precise definition. We cannot always solve it with that
better definition, but we do need to navigate it.</p>
<p>This ties in to the question of teaching tacit knowledge that I
talked about in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-teach-the-local-style">How
to teach the local style</a>. These definitions cannot perfectly capture
the thing you want to convey, but you can get the rough idea, and you
can correct any errors along the way.</p>
<p>One thing that I think is important is that when you’ve introduced
something this way you need to hold people’s hands more when you use the
term. Every time it comes up in future is an opportunity to refine their
understanding of it, and it’s worth taking many of those
opportunities.</p>
<h3 id="how-bad-definitions-thrive">How bad definitions thrive</h3>
<p>Why do so few people meet my standards of good definitions?</p>
<p>I think, primarily, people write bad definitions for the following
reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Nobody taught them how to write good definitions, because the
practice is so rare outside of mathematicians (and also nobody teaches
mathematicians to do it well, they just hope they pick it up by example
like everything else important in mathematics).</li>
<li>Writing good definitions is much harder work than defining things
badly.</li>
<li>Writing good definitions will often reveal that the emperor has no
clothes and you’re using big words for no goddamn good reason to make
yourself sound clever.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m hoping in this essay I have done at least some small part to
offset the first, although it probably needs a longer essay with more
worked examples and better explanations of the various moving parts to
really work for that.</p>
<p>The second is, in fact, good. Writing definitions <em>should</em> be
hard, because every time you introduce a new term (even when you
introduce it well!) you are asking the reader to do a bunch of work, and
significantly harming their ability to understand your text. Often the
best way to define something is to figure out a way to not need it at
all, and where you do need it it’s worth putting in the work to make
sure that people can actually use it.</p>
<p>The third is, I think, the most pernicious. I’m a big fan of Michael
Billig’s “Learn to write badly: How to succeed in the social sciences”.
I tried to find some good excerpts to include here, but it’s not
actually all that well suited to excerpting. In short, he argues that
much of the use of jargon and technical terms in the social sciences is
of an imprecise sort that <em>cannot</em> be defined precisely in this
way, because that would lose its social function, which is more about
marketing your ideas and protecting them from criticism than it is about
carefully and helpfully communicating them.</p>
<p>Charitably, I don’t think most people are deliberately leaning into
this incentive, but I do think many people are innocently writing in a
style that these incentives have shaped, and demanding clear
communication is a good way to push back on those incentives.</p>
