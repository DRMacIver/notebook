<p>An idea that has been fairly foundational to my thinking is
<em>legibility</em>, an idea introduced in James Scott’s “Seeing Like a
State”. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Venkatesh
Rao’s introduction</a> is probably where you need to go if you’re not
familiar with it. I’ve also <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/11/shaping-the-world/">previously
given a talk about it</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve written a bit (<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-06-04-09:58.html">notes
on the legibility war</a>, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-23-09:37.html">legibility
privileges</a>) about how legibility interacts with identity, privilege,
etc. What you might not have noticed in these posts is that I was using
the concept “wrong”. I think my usage is better than the original, so
I’d like to expand on it a bit.</p>
<p>In my usage, illegibility is the amount of work required for the
entity to understand the system - a highly legible system is one that is
low effort to understand. Legibility is that which streamlines things
and makes the system low effort to understand.</p>
<p>The thing about how the concept is originally used is that it treats
legibility as a property of the system, but it’s not. Legibility is a
property of the <em>relationship between the system and some
entity</em>. A thing is not legible or illegible in and of itself, it’s
legible or illegible to someone (or something - a government, a company,
etc).</p>
<p>A useful analogy might be attractiveness. Attractiveness is at a
fairly fundamental level attractiveness to someone in particular, but it
still makes sense to talk about someone being more or less attractive.
People can be more or less attractive in some “objective” sense, but all
that really means is that there are as many different notions of
attractiveness as there are people, but there are a number of strong
correlations between those different notions. These correlations will
depend strongly on local norms, and less but still strongly on a few
universals, but there will also be a huge amount of individual variation
and you cannot really understand attractiveness without paying attention
to that variation.</p>
<p>Scott’s work is a piece of anarchist theory, so he’s particularly
interested in the legibility of the relationship between a single large
and powerful entity (perhaps a large company, but more ordinarily a
state) and many comparatively powerless individuals, but equally
important (especially to marginalised people) is the power individuals
exert over each other, and focusing on legibility as a relationship.</p>
<p>The important point in Scott’s work on legibility is that when we
couple understanding to power, we force the world to become more legible
to us through our attempts to control it.</p>
<p>A good example of this is the standardisation of weights and
measures. Prior to standardisation, there were a large number of local
weights and measures with each village (and often each individual
merchant!) using their own, but the government imposed a single unified
standard so that, among other reasons, they could tax things properly
(this is often the reason for government’s imposing legibility).</p>
<p>Importantly, no individual choice of weights or measures was more or
less legible than any other. The thing that created the illegibility was
that people using different standards were not mutually intelligible to
each other without additional work. You can translate, but you
<em>have</em> to translate if you want to become mutually understood.
Because the government was interacting with many more of these local
standards, the cost of translation was <em>much</em> higher (to the
point of being almost impossible), and their ability to impose their own
standards was also much higher, so standardisation happened.</p>
<p>But standardisation happens locally too. Although individual
merchants may have their own weights and measures, if two merchants
interact regularly enough they’re going to come up with some common
standards. They might not adopt them for everything, but at some point
it becomes easier for them to just share a standard. If, in contrast,
they hardly ever interact, there is no such incentive. This is akin to
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">the
way people learn which way to veer in a collision</a> - conformity is
driven by interactions.</p>
<p>The role of power in this is that of determining which side has a
stronger incentive to conform to the other. A merchant interacting with
a government has a very strong incentive to conform (the government has
much more power) while the government has a comparatively weak incentive
(as well as the merchant having less power, there are many other
merchants with equal and competing demands). Thus the merchant becomes
legible to the government rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Similarly, marginalised people are forced to become legible to the
mainstream rather than the other way around, because by definition there
are fewer of them and they have less power, so they have less ability to
impose their standards of legibility on others.</p>
