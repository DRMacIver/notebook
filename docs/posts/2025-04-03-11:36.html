<p>I have a sort of running “joke” that I don’t have chronic fatigue,
I’m just… fatigued… chronically. Same with pain. Similarly I’m not
disabled, it’s just that sometimes I can’t walk.</p>
<p>Anyway, I don’t have depersonalisation…</p>
<p>Someone on discord recently described my writing as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this guy has actually thought about the most basic mechanics of
“being a person in the world”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons I have to do that is that I don’t feel very good
at being a person, and I’m having to figure it out the hard way.</p>
<p>I genuinely don’t think I actually meet many (any?) of the diagnostic
criteria for depersonalisation, but there’s definitely some sort of
background feeling of… what would it like to actually just effortlessly
be a person?</p>
<p>To be clear, I’m not actually under any illusions about whether I am
or am not a person, and don’t actually benefit from external
reassurances about this. I’m factually clear on the empirical question
of my personhood. But it doesn’t feel like I’m very good at it, and I
don’t trust external observers’ opinions on the subject.</p>
<p>The reason I don’t trust external observers here is that I think
people rarely notice this about me, because I’m highly functional in
short bursts and in company, and so this adds up to seeming extremely
like a person in any externally observable scenario. But what that feels
like from the inside is that I <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/cohering-and-decohering">cohere</a>
when observed or otherwise prompted to by circumstances, but can’t
easily do so under my own steam, and by default just collapse into a
sort of decohered blob that left to its own devices will just <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html">drift</a>.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">If you’re wondering if that’s related to the
aforementioned definitely-don’t-have-chronic-fatigue, yeah me too. I
don’t know how much, or in which direction, but it sure seems like a
thing. If you’re thinking “gosh David, it sure sounds like what you’re
describing is depression”, yes I know. I did start by talking about a
key major common diagnostic feature of depression after all…</span></p>
<p>It feels, almost, like having a self that lacks object permanence.
It’s not there if someone isn’t looking. And, sure, it’s relatively
stable in its characteristics each fresh time it exists, because it’s
made out of roughly the same parts each time, but it still went through
a phase of not existing and coming back into existence, with a
discontinuity between those two things.</p>
<p>Anyway, this seems bad, and I’d like to fix it. In some ways, fixing
it is probably a core feature of my project, although I don’t know that
I’ve done a very good job of that.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I tend to think of my personal project as something more
like “Figure out how to be less depressed”, but it has a lot of details
and pulls in a lot of life in general</span></p>
<p>Part of fixing it is just <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-31-18:47.html">finding
more circumstances in which I can cohere</a>, but I think another bigger
part is a sort of… OK, sometimes you’re not a person. That’s normal.
Going to sleep for example is a legitimate interruption in continuity.
Or sometimes you just lose yourself in flow in a way that interrupts
your conscious awareness of what’s going on, or get drunk, or are ill,
or… You get the idea. If an enduring sense of self requires full
continuity, you’re never going to have it.</p>
<p>I think the analogy to object permanence is interesting, because the
thing about lacking object permanence is that <em>objects actually are
permanent</em>. The fact that they cease to exist for you in between
viewings doesn’t actually mean they cease to exist. What’s lacking is
not a permanence to their existence, but your sense of that permanence
as a unified thing.</p>
<p>I think part of how you build that unity between different fragments
of yourself across time is that you start to build links between them.
Part of what’s interesting about the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html">attitude
to commitments</a> I’m trying to foster is that it is casting a link
forward in the future between yourself now and who you will be. Being
able to do this reliably starts to help you feel that you will continue
to exist in the future as an entity contiguous with who you are now. You
are, but actually being able to act on that helps you <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">alieve</a>
that.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-02-18:59.html">telling
stories about your life</a> is likely the other part of this link, and
it’s part of why I’m trying to figure out how to explore that. In much
the same ways commitments cast a link forward, a story casts a link
backwards, connecting up who you are now with who you were then.</p>
<p>Alasdair MacIntyre has this notion of “narrative identity” as the
thing that constitutes selfhood. I haven’t read much about this, though
I do keep vaguely intending to. I guess I’m gesturing at something like
that, although I’m not sure we’re talking about exactly the same sort of
thing. I don’t think you can view self as wholly constituted by
narrative, but I do think that narrative is perhaps an important tool
for building a skeleton that a self can grow on top of.</p>
