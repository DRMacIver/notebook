<p>The following is not true, but it’s often close enough to true that
it’s worth using as a working model.</p>
<p>When learning a skill, the level of effort required to get to a given
point typically looks something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/effortskillgraph.png"/></p>
<p>This corresponds to the following difficulties of improvement at any
given point:</p>
<p><img src="/images/difficultyskillgraph.png"/></p>
<p>(These numbers are made up imaginary units, obviously)</p>
<p>That is, the difficulty of getting better is usually pretty easy, but
occasionally there are spikes where the difficulty rapidly increases.
The gentle bits are the places where the way to improve is to just do
the thing, the spikes are the bits where <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-do-everything">there’s
some insight you need to figure out to progress</a>.</p>
<p>A very simplistic model of human behaviour is that people do things
that are worth the effort of doing. As a result, what often happens when
people are learning a skill is that they progress as long as it’s easy,
and then they hit a part where it’s difficult it’s no longer worth it to
them to keep progressing.</p>
<p>As a result what you end up with is people who stall out particular
points in their skill progression, thinking they have reached the limit
of their talent, when in fact all they needed was a sustained period of
effort at which point they would have started getting better again.</p>
<p>I think people generally solve these problems in one of three
ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Being smart tends to lower the effort in one of these spikes. I
don’t know how much of this is “intrinsic” smartness and how much is
having already learned the right skills of learning, but if smartness is
a thing at all it certainly reduces the effort of generating insights
when you’re blocked on skill development.</li>
<li>Being very into the subject makes more effort seem worth it, so
someone with exactly the same level of “talent” but more interest will
often get better because they reach a spike in difficulty and it’s still
worth it to them to overcome it.</li>
<li>Having a good teacher <em>hugely</em> reduces the difficulty level
of these spikes, because they already know the insights you’re
struggling to come up with and can help you discover them.</li>
<li>Believing in this model will often motivate you to put in more
effort than seems reasonable until you’ve overcome the hump, banking on
the promise of future reward (I think, to the degree that they do, this
is a lot of why “growth mindset” interventions work).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what I tend to mean when I say that almost nobody is
bottlenecked on talent. They’re probably just at a point in their skill
development where it wasn’t worth it for them to get better on their
own, and nobody provided them with the right external support they
needed to overcome the current spike in difficulty.</p>
<p>This is then compounded by the fact that the messaging they get about
skill tends to convince them that this is evidence that they lack talent
and will never be good at the thing, when in fact they’re probably not
substantially less talented than many people who end up way better than
them due to a mix of luck, privilege, and motivation.</p>
