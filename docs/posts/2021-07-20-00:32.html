<h1 id="the-trauma-model-of-talent-blocks">The trauma model of talent
blocks</h1>
<p>There’s something very important you learn as a result of doing a
mathematics degree. It’s this: People <em>really</em> didn’t like
studying mathematics at school, and they are keen to tell you.</p>
<p>There’s something like a 50% hit rate when you talk to normal people
(people in tech don’t count) that when you tell someone you did
mathematics at university they say “Oh god I hated mathematics at
school”. Sometimes they say it in different words. “Oh.”, in a very flat
tone of voice. “You must be very clever”. They look at you with the wary
look of a gazelle facing off with a lion, fearful and ready to bolt at
the slightest sign of you baring your teeth and trying to do an equation
at them.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I’ve historically found this quite irritating, but as
time has gone on I’ve started looking at it differently. Instead of
treating this as an attack on my interests, when people say this to me
my first thought is more along the lines of “I’m sorry your mathematics
teacher hurt you.”</p>
<p>I don’t usually say it that way, that’s a good way to get punched.
Instead I wince sympathetically and say “Yeah, it’s often taught really
badly.”</p>
<p>Sometimes I add “Sorry about that”.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-16-10:12.html">clearing
hurdles in learning</a> I talked about how often what happens is that
people hit a block where the they require help to progress and think of
this as their natural talent limit.</p>
<p>The detail this missed out on is what happens next, which is that you
get stuck and we do two things, in order:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Tell you to try harder.</li>
<li>Blame you for not succeeding and then tell you it’s your fault and
is an intrinsic feature of you and your abilities.</li>
</ol>
<p>A distinction I find quite useful is that between guilt and shame.
Guilt is when you feel bad about what you do, shame is when you feel bad
about who you are. “I did a bad thing” vs “I am bad”. It’s not a perfect
distinction but it’s a pretty good rule of thumb.</p>
<p>Another principle I find useful (see <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">Jiminy
Cricket Must Die</a>, or “Voices: The Educational Formation of
Conscience” by Thomas Green) is that moral emotions are the internalised
judgement of others.</p>
<p>A third principle I find useful is that emotional reactions we learn
tend to stick around until we find a way to actively engage with them
and change them by recognising that our situations have changed (see <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">Emotional
reactions as legacy code</a>, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-03-09:07.html">Your
emotions are valid but probably wrong</a>).</p>
<p>Sure <em>seems</em> like having kids spend a substantial fraction of
their entire childhood in an environment in which they are praised or
punished for their academic achievement, then telling them that their
failure to excel is the result of an intrinsic feature of themselves and
punishing them for it anyway might have some uh lasting negative
emotional side effects, huh?</p>
<p>Anyway, let me tell you about my experience learning to drive.</p>
<p>My attempts to learn to drive went as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I had driving lessons when I was 18. I was bad at it. I stopped
driving lessons and went to university in a town where I could cycle
everywhere.</li>
<li>I moved back in with my parents for about six months post
university, and used this as an opportunity to practice driving.</li>
<li>I took a few more driving lessons to fill in some gaps, I was fine,
and I passed my practical test first time.</li>
<li>I’m absolutely fine at driving, and am comfortable enough doing it
that I’ve done multiple long road trips.</li>
</ol>
<p>What made the difference between my first attempts at learning to
drive and my subsequent attempts?</p>
<p>Well, my first driving instructor was a very angry person, and tended
to shout when I made mistakes. The result was that I was so anxious
learning to drive and so afraid of making errors that I was unable to
drive to any degree of competence.</p>
<p>It’s certainly not the case that I’m a natural driver. My physical
coordination and spatial awareness are on the poor side. It’s possibly
genuinely true that I was dangerous and needed correcting in my first
driving lessons.</p>
<p>And yet, somehow shouting at me about that didn’t help, because it
turns out that experiencing intense negative emotions every time you
make an error is not <em>remotely</em> conducive to the acquisition of
complex skills.</p>
<p>I don’t expect feeling shame every time you think of a subject is
much different.</p>
<p>I want to be clear: This is, for the most part, not teachers’ fault.
There are definitely individual teachers who make the problem worse
(e.g. by behaving like my driving instructor), and there are individual
teachers who make the problem less bad, but fundamentally this is a
function of the system. It arises from the system of grading, and is
compounded by the fact that when you hit a block you need individually
tailored help to overcome it, which our systems of teaching are
absolutely not set up to provide unless your parents are rich enough to
hire a tutor for you. While a great teacher can ameliorate the worst of
this problem, attempting to solve it will break them because the task is
too big.</p>
<p>But regardless of whose fault it is, it seems to hurt a lot of people
pretty badly, because they end up hitting their “talent limits” - the
bits where they needed help - and instead of either helping them
progress or telling them that their current level was good enough, the
education system chose violence and made their attempts to improve
<em>harder</em>, not just now but effectively forever until they unlearn
the incorrect emotional lessons that they got instead of the lessons
they should have been getting.</p>
<p>I suspect that above and beyond the specific subjects that we fail to
learn as a result of this dynamic, it has a much broader impact on our
conception of ourselves, because we think in terms of subjects we are
good at and subjects we are bad at, when instead we should be thinking
more in terms of how good we want to be a subject and how much help we
need to get there.</p>
<p>I also suspect that many people would find it really helpful to get
some one on one tutoring in subjects they struggled at at school where
they feel bad about that.</p>
<p>But, suspicions aside, one thing I’m reasonably certain of is that
there are a lot of adults walking around with lingering low-grade trauma
from school that they think of as their “lack of talent”, and would
benefit a great deal from the following reframing: It’s not that you’re
bad at it, whatever “it” is, you were just never given the sort of help
you needed.</p>
