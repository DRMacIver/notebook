 I'm a huge fan of
 <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">
  beeminder</a>.
I was on a break with it for a while, not for any very good reason, but I've been back using it for a couple of months now, and it's really good to be back.</p>
<p>
 A lot of the things I've been using beeminder for recently are a sort of... "making the fundamental feature of Beeminder contagious".
The fundamental feature of Beeminder for me is that you cannot simply decide to give up on a goal - because the goal will charge you if you don't satisfy it,
and because you have to wait a week for changes to take effect, the choice to stop a goal has to be a deliberate decision planned out in advance.</p>
<p>
 This is fairly huge to me.</p>
<p>
 A lot of goals I've had recently are basically of the form "keep doing the thing". This allows me to create systems with this property - beeminder doesn't track my
 <em>
  success</em>
 at using the system, it just tracks that I'm doing it at all.</p>
<p>
 Examples:</p>
<ul>
 <li>
  Writing in my journal</li>
 <li>
  Keeping up my book kanban</li>
 <li>
  This notebook</li>
 <li>
  Using the day plan system</li></ul>
<p>
 The notebook and day plan goals do have some quantity attached to them but it's not that important. The journal and book goals literally all they track is "Did I do the thing today?". If yes, I get a point. If no, I don't.
I can do as much or as little as I like as long as I do
 <em>
  something</em>. The
 <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-09-27-12:18.html">
  system itself is then what keeps me doing it well</a>
 , "all" beeminder is doing is keeping me participating in it.</p>
