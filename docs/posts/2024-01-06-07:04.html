<p>I’m a big fan of giving advice. You should give more advice. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-17-14:20.html">Appropriately</a>
and <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-give-good-advice">effectively</a>,
but helping people is good and advice, done well, is one of the easiest
ways to help people.</p>
<p>But a thing I’ve been noticing for a while is that a lot of advice
isn’t really designed to help people. It’s designed to discharge your
responsibility, real or imagined, for helping them, in a way that makes
having the problem their problem rather than yours.</p>
<p>The characteristic features of this sort of disingenuous advice
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s not exactly <em>bad</em> advice. It’s important that it could,
in theory, solve the problem.</li>
<li>It tends to be quite one-size-fits-all. It shows very little
engagement with the actual problem - if you were going to put in enough
effort to tailor your advice, you’d probably make at least some effort
to give reasonable advice.</li>
<li>It tends to be quite simple, so as to make it seem easy. It’s the
sort of thing that you could very naturally use the word “just” in.</li>
<li>It seems to encourage closing off further conversation until you’ve
tried to follow the advice. Reasons why the advice won’t work sound like
excuses.</li>
<li>It is, in fact, very hard to follow this advice and even following
the advice isn’t guaranteed to work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The prompt for me to start noticing this pattern is how often “go to
therapy” is this. Therapy is a perfectly valuable tool that, if you can
afford it, can help with many categories of emotional problems. It also
tends to be suggested very blindly, for large categories of problems
that it’s not especially suited for, and to people who are probably not
well set up to benefit from it (e.g. because they can’t afford it, or
because the real problem is that their life sucks in very tangible ways
and their negative emotions mostly stem from that). But by suggesting
going to therapy you make it very clear that their problems aren’t
yours, you’ve suggested a solution now, they should go make it a
therapist’s problem.</p>
<p>“Learn to code” as a response to career problems is another common
one. It’s not necessarily bad advice - software is a pretty good career
option for some people. But it’s not a catch all solution to career
problems - not everyone is actually well suited to work in software,
retraining is hard, getting your first software job is hard, and there
may be many better lateral transfers for most people that actually get
to use their current experience.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Also not all jobs can be software jobs you do actually
have to move atoms as well as bits.</span></p>
<p>Another example that came up on discord recently was students having
to ask permission to go to the bathroom in class, and how bad this is
(especially given that it can be refused). The advice “you should have
gone to the bathroom between classes” absolves your responsibility to
them by making it the student’s fault for their lack of forethought.</p>
<p>All of these very effectively discharge your responsibility without
being in any way helpful. They are, at best, <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/i/39151933/checklist-advice">checklist
advice</a>, without any suggestion that you’re willing to do the rest of
the checklist or, heaven forbid, actually offer real advice once the
checklist is completed.</p>
<p>Now, often it’s perfectly reasonable not to want their problem to be
yours. If it’s some stranger on the internet asking you to feel bad for
them and care about their problems then… I don’t know, I probably think
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-23-13:27.html">you
should feel bad for them</a>. Certainly it’s not fard, but it might be
mustahabb.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I got the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fard">Islamic tiers of moral
obligation</a> from <a href="/images/islamic-moral-tiers.webp">some
random Tumblr post that no longer seems to exist on the internet</a> but
it’s very useful and somewhat better grain than most of the equivalent
English words. The point I’m making here is that this is a morally good
act that you are not required to do.</span> But this is hard, and most people
don’t want to do it. What they do want, however, is to feel good about
themselves, so giving a plausible appearance of caring is helpful. Or,
even better, being able to credibly suggest that in fact the speaker is
bad for having this problem and it’s their fault for not having solved
it already, thus not only discharging your obligations but making it
clear that you didn’t have any obligations to discharge in the first
place.</p>
<p>This is particularly bad behaviour when you’re not in the “strangers
on the internet” scenario and it’s someone who you do have some sort of
responsibility to - a personal relationship, one of your reports at
work, a student of yours, etc. There it is not just a disavowal of
responsibility that you don’t want to have, it’s a refusal to accept the
responsibility that you <em>do</em> have.</p>
<p>Even when you don’t have any responsibility to the person, I do think
it is your responsibility not to give this sort of disingenuous advice.
As well as being <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-04-10:02.html">dishonest</a>,
the sheer ubiquity of this behaviour is a failure of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-14:34.html">collective
responsibility</a>, and while you might have no individual
responsibility to the advice recipient, I do think you have an
individual responsibility not to make these collective problems
worse.</p>
