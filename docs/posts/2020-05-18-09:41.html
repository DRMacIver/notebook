<p>Today we release Version 37.0 of the DRMacIver software system. We’ve
been working on it for a whole year, and are pretty excited to share the
results with you.</p>
<p>In reality we of course practice continuous deployment and so have
been rolling out releases through the entirety of the last year, and all
of our changes are breaking changes so there’s no hint of semantic
versioning in our release process, but nevertheless bumping the major
version number is a good chance to talk about some of the exciting new
developments over the last year.</p>
<p>The major improvements we’ve seen since the Version 36.0 release
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve refactored an awful lot of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">legacy
code</a></li>
<li>Significantly improved write performance</li>
<li>Modest improvements to read performance</li>
<li>We’ve fixed the bug where the brain randomly crashed in social
situations</li>
<li>The system has finally <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/">evolved to the point where it can
send email</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In case you don’t get the joke (you probably get the joke) it’s my
37th birthday today. Today is, legally speaking, the year where I have
to start saying I’m in my mid to late 30s rather than in my mid 30s.</p>
<p>Back in ancient times, when I were a wee lad in my late 20s, I used
to say that I didn’t really mind the idea of hitting 30 (back then 30
seemed very old) because the people I knew in their 30s were mostly like
the people I knew in their 20s only they had their shit a bit more
together.</p>
<p>I then spent the first half of my thirties with my shit <em>very</em>
not together - life went a bit sideways in the dying months of 29 and it
took me about five years before I hit rock bottom enough to start doing
something about it. The result was me rather disconnecting from people
emotionally, and it didn’t have a great impact on my career either.</p>
<p>People don’t really notice that I’m not a software developer any
more, partly because I only became famous as a software developer after
I stopped being one. Officially <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/">4% of
Python developers are running my code</a>. I wrote that code <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1194550244496814081">entirely after
burning out</a>. I haven’t actually been employed as a software
developer since early 2015, outside of the occasional short term
contract for Hypothesis work.</p>
<p>There’s something about the software development industry that burns
people out. I don’t know what it is, but it does it to most people.
Maybe every industry is like this and I just mostly see it in the one I
know? Maybe it’s just <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-16-12:06.html">acedia</a>.</p>
<p>I started to pull myself out of the hole around 2017 I guess - I
moved back to London, started a PhD, kinda started seeing people. In
late 2018 I started a new relationship, which has been going very well.
It prompted some reflection, and I’ve spent a lot of the intervening
period attempting to sort my shit out in the way that a decade ago I,
apparently, naively assumed would come with age.</p>
<p>Is it working? I guess.</p>
<p>Part of why I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html">Easy
Changes and Uncomfortable Reflections</a> was that it was what I needed
to hear (that’s why I write a lot of these posts). It’s quite hard to
escape the feeling that I could have done all this work seven years ago,
or seventeen years ago, or even twenty seven years ago, and life would
have gone a lot better for it. I think this is partly true, but mostly
false, but it still feels like a wasted opportunity.</p>
<p>Today’s Tarot draw (I’ve been doing daily draws even when they’ve not
made it into the notebook) is the <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/ca.htm">Ace of Cups</a>, which signifies
among other things getting in touch with your feelings. Well I’ve done
that. It’s got its good points, and there’s yet more to do on that
front, but also it kinda sucks in that one of the major downsides of
becoming more in touch with your own feelings is that you’re more aware
of your feelings, and sometimes those feelings are bad. I think I’ve in
many ways been less depressed over the last year than I’ve been… ever,
possibly, but it doesn’t necessarily <em>feel</em> like that because I’m
more aware of it.</p>
<p>Especially given, as you might have noticed, there’s a global
pandemic on at the moment.</p>
<p>This post was meant to be reasonably optimistic - I do think that the
next few years will be quite good for me - but entering my late thirties
in the middle of a global pandemic feels weird. I can barely predict
what next week is going to look like, let alone the next three
years.</p>
<p>All told, I’m doing what I can to lay a solid foundation for whatever
comes next. It might even work.</p>
