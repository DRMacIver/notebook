<p>Another draft bankruptcy post. I think this was abandoned for a
fairly common reason for me to abandon posts: I tried to write it
because it was important, but it’s actually a fairly depressing subject
for me to write about and I didn’t particularly want to write it.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I run a small<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Officially we’re about 400 people, with a regulars list
of about 100 people, of whom maybe half are regularly active.</span> but fairly successful discord
server. <a href="https://discord.gg/bY5XKnWMQj">You can join if you want
to</a>. Nominally it’s about this newsletter, and occasionally we even
remember that, but mostly it’s just a bunch of nerds who hang out on the
internet, help each other navigate life better, and talk about stuff we
like. I think it’s pretty great.</p>
<p>I act as the sole authority figure for how the community works.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It’s not a cult, I promise.</span>. This is a space on the internet I
manage to cultivate the sort of community and conversations I want to
exist. It’s what I’ve called <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-14-13:42.html">Living
Room Rules</a> before - it’s the equivalent of people coming around to
my house to hang out.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean the community do whatever I want. Truthfully, it’s
like herding cats sometimes. But it does mean that when the community
isn’t working, it’s my responsibility to fix it. Often in consultation
with others, but ultimately I’m the one who makes the call.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this is that sometimes you have to show people
the door.</p>
<p>I had to do this with someone yesterday<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Possibly he’s reading this. If so, sorry. Editor’s note:
Presumably not on the notebook. Also this “yesterday” was actually more
than a year ago.</span>. He
wasn’t right for the community.</p>
<p>This is only the second time I’ve had to ask someone to leave this
discord (I’ve <em>banned</em> some people for outright terrible
behaviour, but that’s different), but I’ve seen it with other
communities in the past. Crucially, I’ve seen it with other communities
in the past because the community leadership <em>didn’t</em> ask the
person to leave. This kills the community.</p>
<p>One of the key things you are there for in a community - what
<em>makes</em> it a community - is the other people. A community is, at
its core, a group of people who do stuff together. Having someone who
fails to gel with the group and can’t easily be avoided around disrupts
that, because it adds friction to every interaction.</p>
<p>What this means is that if some is disrupting the group’s ability to
interact, there is less of the thing that brings people there, and some
people who were already marginal stop showing up so much. This in turn
means that the people who were there partly to hang out with those
people stop showing up so much, which in turn…</p>
<p>It’s not a complete death spiral even in the worst case. Usually some
subset of the community stays - those who don’t have any better options,
or who are still too attached to what the community used to be - but the
community turns into a shell of its former self.</p>
<p>More commonly, one person who doesn’t mesh with the others isn’t
enough to offset the rest of the benefits people are getting, but the
community contracts a bit and what’s left feels slightly less thriving.
If you add more such people, it may get worse, .</p>
<p>Internet communities without a shared project are particularly
vulnerable to this, because there’s <em>nothing</em> bringing people
there except the other people, so if you ruin those interactions you’ve
got nothing.</p>
<p>In contrast, communities built around something are a bit more
robust. e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>An open source project you have the motivation of the project itself
- you’re there because you want it for stuff. A sufficiently toxic
contributor can definitely drive you off, and someone you don’t get
along with can definitely sap your motivation to contribute<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Open source is pretty good at doing this on its own,
honestly.</span>, but you’re at least there for some
specific purpose external to the people involved.</li>
<li>Volunteer-driven physical projects (e.g. charitable works,
maintenance of some space, etc) are the same but more so.</li>
<li>Communities built around access to some resource. e.g. you’re
probably not going to stop hanging out on the midjourney discord just
because you don’t like the people there, because that’s where you go to
use midjourney.</li>
<li>Physical communities with shared physical resources are even more
like this. The people at your local maker space or tennis club might be
super annoying, but if it’s the only place you can go to get access to a
laser cutter or a tennis court, you’re still going to keep going.</li>
</ul>
<p>These places still can be harmed by people who don’t mesh well with
the group, and sometimes even outright ruined, but it’s much harder and
they’re more robust against it because of the additional draw to keep
coming back beyond just liking the people there.</p>
<h3 id="who-needs-to-leave">Who needs to leave?</h3>
<p>Importantly, the person who I asked to leave wasn’t an asshole. He
was a bit hard to deal with, but he didn’t cross any lines where I could
feel good about just pressing the ban button. He just consistently
failed to mesh with the community in a way that made everyone else’s
experience worse when he was in the room.</p>
<p>Frankly, he was probably just of an age where relatively few people
would fit in with the rest of us - we’re mostly in our 30s, and he was
in his late teens or early 20s, and I think most people of that age
wouldn’t have fit. Certainly I can’t imagine a 19 year old version of me
doing well there. There’s just too large an experience gap.</p>
<p>This sort of thing is, in general, the problem zone: People who have
not and probably never will do anything that lets you go “Right, you’ve
crossed a line” and kick them out, but you really wish they would.</p>
<p>When you start feeling that way about someone, you probably need to
think seriously about asking them to leave. If you don’t, people you
want in the community much more will leave on their own instead.</p>
<h3 id="afterword">Afterword</h3>
<p>I tapered out there partially because I don’t really have good advice
on how to navigate this. This is hard, and I’ve not got more than a
handful of personal examples of doing it, and I’m not confident that I
handled it especially well, or that I know what handling it well looks
like in full generality.</p>
<p>All I know is that I’ve seen communities die by not doing this, and
it’s a problem that needs solving</p>
