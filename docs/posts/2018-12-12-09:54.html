<p>I have a very strong preference for short books. In <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/11/faq-how-do-you-read-so-many-books/">How do you read so many books?</a> I suggested the following rules of thumb:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the book is under a hundred pages I’m probably just going to read it. I can do that in two hours, no problem. I can always stop if I hate it.</li>
<li>If the book is between one and two hundred pages it’s worth spending a bit of time determining if it’s worthwhile, especially if it’s not that well written.</li>
<li>If the book is more than three hundred pages I am very unlikely to read it if it’s badly written. If it’s well written then I hold it to a higher standard of value but am still willing to read it.</li>
<li>If the book is more than five hundred pages then I basically want someone signing a promise in blood that it’s worth my time to read it.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I've noticed that there are some exceptions to this rule where I'm perefectly OK with longer books. The main one is textbooks. I don't expect textbooks to be short, but that's OK because <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/05/how-to-read-a-mathematics-textbook/">I don't expect to read them cover to cover either</a>.</p>
<p>There are some non textbook examples as well. I <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-11-15-18:17.html">really liked Rewriting the Rules</a> despite its 400 pages.
I'm currently reading and enjoying <a href="https://amzn.to/2zUVY4F">Watching the English</a> despite it being more than 500 pages and nobody having signed that promise in blood I asked for.</p>
<p>It occurs to me that there are two defining characteristics of an acceptable long book:</p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the length is to create a sense of <a href="https://thiscontinuity.tumblr.com/post/174940553579/notateapot-thiscontinuity-hey-psst-over-here">thamagar</a> - the length is not compressible, because it is mostly occupied by conveying details that you would not be able to infer from the rest.</li>
<li>The book is well cross-referenced for skippability. I've just skipped the sections on racing and squaddie talk in Watching the English because I just don't care about those bits and because I trust the author to refer back if I turn out to need them after all.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast I really like the concepts from "Seeing Like a State" but I felt like the book did not justify its length because almost all of the length was composed of making the same point over and over again.</p>
