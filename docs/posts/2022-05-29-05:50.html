<h1 id="what-every-programming-tutorial-gets-wrong">What every
programming tutorial gets wrong</h1>
<p>Another piece of draft bankruptcy. This is my attempt to explain a
common failure mode of programming tutorials. I got quite far, but
eventually abandoned it.</p>
<h3 id="scene-setting">Scene setting</h3>
<p>A while ago I was helping teach a coding workshop to a bunch of
people who had never coded before, and we were working through the
written materials which were very “Do this, then do that”. Copy this
code and you should see this happen, etc.</p>
<p>At some point a student asked me “OK, but what is actually going on
here? What does any of this mean? I can follow the steps, but I have no
idea what is going on.”</p>
<p>This was an incredibly reasonable question and I’m glad she asked it
of me, and that I could answer it, because I can’t imagine that she
would have come away with any knowledge of programming without it.</p>
<p>I can’t remember the specific thing we were talking about, but I
think the example was something like:</p>
<pre class="pycon"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; user = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; user["login"] = "Bob"
&gt;&gt;&gt; user["login"]
"Bob"
&gt;&gt;&gt; user["some other key"]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
KeyError: 'some other key'</code></pre>
<p>This is entirely clear if you’re a programmer (especially if you’re a
Python programmer, but it’s sufficiently universal that probably most
programmers will have a pretty good idea of what’s going on), but if
you’ve never programmed before it’s just so much noise.</p>
<p>In response to this question I would have said something as
follows:</p>
<p>The program you’re using here is called the
REPL(Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop, but don’t worry about that. It’s
pronounced repple, like ripple with an eh). You’re entering commands
into it by writing statements in a programming language called
Python.</p>
<p>The interpreter keeps track of a number of “objects”, which are a
chunk of data along with a particular set of commands that can you can
use to change that data, ask questions about it, etc. There are also
commands that let you interact with the computer more broadly
(e.g. reading and writing files) but we won’t worry about them just yet
in this tutorial.</p>
<p>Here what we’re doing is creating an object, giving it the name
<em>user</em> that we can refer to it by, and issuing some commands and
seeing what happens.</p>
<p>Specifically, we are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Creating an object of a specific type called a
<em>dictionary</em> and referring to it by the name <em>user</em>. The
curly brackets <code>{}</code> create a new dictionary, and
“<code>user =</code>” is where we declare that we will refer to it as
<em>user</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>A dictionary is an object whose job is to keep track of a table
of information. It maps <em>keys</em> to <em>values</em>, which are just
arbitrary things you can put into it, so that if you tell it to
associate a value with particular key, and then later ask for the value
associated with that key, you get the same thing back.</p></li>
<li><p>Telling the dictionary we have just created (referred to by its
name, <em>user</em>) that it should associate the value “Bob” with the
key “login”. “Bob” and “login” are objects of a type called
<em>string</em>, which represents a piece of text.</p></li>
<li><p>Looking up the key “login” and getting the expected value “Bob”
back.</p></li>
<li><p>Looking up the key “some other key” and getting an error that
tells us that the dictionary has not yet been told to associate any
values with that key.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This isn’t a perfect answer, because I just made it up on the spot
and haven’t tested it against students to see what questions they ask,
but it’s probably pretty good. It certainly gives them more of a hook to
play around with dictionaries in the interpreter and see what happens,
and it gives them better questions to ask than “Help I don’t understand
anything about what’s going on”.</p>
<h3 id="theory-examples-and-ability">Theory, examples, and ability</h3>
<p>I’m going to be using “theory”, “examples”, and “ability”, in
slightly specific ways (which are possibly slightly idiosyncratic to me,
although I think compatible with normal use) in this issue, so I’ll try
to explain what I mean by them.</p>
<p>An example is just any concrete version of the thing being taught.
For example, “do these steps in the REPL” above is an example. Showing
someone a program is an example. Showing someone a mathematical proof is
an example.</p>
<p>“Theory” is the knowledge that you need to answer questions like
“What’s going on here?” and explain the behaviour of a particular
example. For example, in the above, you need some sort of theory to
answer the question “Why did typing <code>user["login"]</code> show
<code>"Bob"</code> but typing <code>user["some other key"]</code> showed
an error message?”</p>
<p>“Ability” is the set of things the student can now do themselves. The
goal of teaching is to help the student expand their abilities. People
don’t generally expand their abilities directly as the result of
teaching - you can only learn to do things by doing things - but
teaching points them in the right direction by giving them better ideas
of things to try. They still learn by trial and error, but teaching can
give them better things to try and help them understand their
errors.</p>
<p>The goal of the above tutorial was to help them develop the ability
to write simple Python programs involving dictionaries, and to some
degree it succeeded. After going through this tutorial the student knows
how to launch the Python REPL, and has at least one example of something
reasonable to experiment with. Given a little bit of time to sit and
play with the REPL they might come up with a pretty reasonable theory
for explaining its behaviour.</p>
<p>Why do they need to develop that theory? Because theory gives them
the ability to <em>generalise</em>. If you have a theory that can
explain why a given action succeeded or failed, you now believe that any
action that matches that same explanation will also work or fail. This
lets you try out other things and see whether they confirm or deny your
theory, which is typically a much more productive model of trial and
error than one can manage without a theory of what’s going on.</p>
<h3 id="examples-are-vitally-important">Examples are vitally
important</h3>
<p>I should be clear: It is very good that the tutorial we were doing
was dumping people in the REPL and getting them to play around with it.
This is not my complaint, it’s the correct thing to do. My complaint is
that the tutorial did not then contain anything like my answer
above.</p>
<p>One of my pet peeves that has been coming out in places on the
notebook blog recently is that I hate people who introduce theory
without supporting examples in which to understand it. See e.g. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-02-09:29.html">People
are bad at defining things</a>.</p>
<p>In particular it’s often worth having examples <em>first</em> (this
isn’t always possible), because then you can refer to concrete features
of them while introducing the theory. You saw a bit of that in how I
explained what was going on in the programming tutorial: I started with
an example, and then I highlighted specific features of it to ground the
theory (We’re creating a thing called an object, it’s a specific type of
object called a dictionary, then we’re doing this to it, etc.)</p>
<p>The examples are particularly important. In order to understand a
theory, you need to be able to see how it applies to real concrete
things. Abstracting from concrete instances is literally the point of
theory, so without seeing how it relates to the things it abstracts
theory is just so many words.</p>
<p>On top of that, examples are often key to developing abilities.
People do not, generally speaking, reason from first principles from a
theory. If you read the literature on naturalised decision making, what
people tend to do is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_primed_decision">recognition-primed
decision making</a>. They look at what’s in front of them, they reason
by analogy, thinking “Oh, this looks like that thing I saw before, let
me see what happens if I do the same thing that I did there…”. Having a
rich and varied library of examples is vitally important for this.</p>
<p>(I’d recommend Cedric Chin’s <a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/a-framework-for-putting-mental-models-to-practice/">A
Framework for Putting Mental Models into Practice</a>, but it’s also
worth reading Gary Klein’s “Sources of Power” and maybe some of his
other work.)</p>
<h3 id="theory-helps-you-remember-examples">Theory helps you remember
examples</h3>
<p>Let’s look at our example again:</p>
<pre class="pycon"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; user = {}
&gt;&gt;&gt; user["login"] = "Bob"
&gt;&gt;&gt; user["login"]
"Bob"
&gt;&gt;&gt; user["some other key"]
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
KeyError: 'some other key' </code></pre>
<p>Do you think you could recreate this example from memory? I certainly
could, and I think most programmers could with only a little bit of
thought. It possibly wouldn’t be character by character perfect, but you
could certainly get the right general idea.</p>
<p>Now consider the following highly readable example. Do you think you
could recreate <em>this</em> from memory?</p>
<pre class="pycon"><code>&lt;&lt;&lt; d"T{ o Bm
&lt;&lt;&lt; d"T{sn)gK[ena o n:g}n
&lt;&lt;&lt; d"T{sn)gK[ena
n:g}n
&lt;&lt;&lt; d"T{sn"gyT g](T{ tTuna
&gt;{ilT}ilt kyg"] {TlTe] li)) )i"]'1
   ,[)T nE"]h[e&lt;n= )[eT b= [e Eyghd)T&lt;
FTuc{{g{1 r"gyT g](T{ tTur</code></pre>
<p>If you haven’t figured out the trick, this is the same example as
above, I’ve just jumbled all the letters through a mapping that replaces
them (e.g. &gt; gets replaced with &lt;).</p>
<p>Do you think you could recreate this example from memory? I sure
couldn’t.</p>
<p>In some sense this contains exactly the same information as the
original, but because you’re unable to easily turn it into a sensible
representation, it’s much harder to remember and thus much harder to
understand. As well as the Python specific bits you also rely on e.g.
brackets matching, quotes matching, familiar understanding of the
meaning of the = symbol, the ability to clearly distinguish which bits
are identifiers because they’re contained in quotes, etc.</p>
<p>When we know what’s going on, we can describe the example as the
following sequence of steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a dictionary called user.</p></li>
<li><p>Insert the value “Bob” into “user” with the key “login”</p></li>
<li><p>Look up the key “login” in “user” and get the result</p></li>
<li><p>Look up the key “some other key” in “user” and see an error from
looking up a missing key</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a <em>high level representation</em> of what’s going on. It
describes the steps we are taking, not the specific details that we
know. This is easy to remember, because it’s a set of comprehensible
steps.</p>
<p>Now, we’re not expecting students to actually memorise specific
examples, but ability to memorise is a pretty good proxy for how well
the example fits in their head - if you can’t easily remember what
should be a fairly simple example, that’s a sign that there’s too much
going for you to really figure it out and you’re trying to learn too
much at once.</p>
<p>This sort of translation into a high level representation is what
theory does for you, and lets you organise your mental library of
examples.</p>
<h3 id="theory-helps-you-generalise">Theory helps you generalise</h3>
<p>As well as helping you remember examples you’ve seen before, theory
lets you <em>adapt</em> those previous examples to your needs.</p>
<p>This high level representation does a number of important things for
us:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It allows us to understand the meaning of the thing we are
writing in terms of what we are trying to do rather than the literal
characters on the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>This makes it easier to remember because we can remember “Create
a dictionary called user” separately from the literal syntax for
creating a dictionary. We still have to remember both, but the latter is
a fact we can more easily look up and will use often enough to
remember.</p></li>
<li><p>It lets us make predictions for what we would see if we changed
the example.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="doing-the-right-things-is-the-most-important">Doing (the right)
things is the most important</h3>
<p>This particularly shows up in the trial and error process of
learning. While you are still floundering around trying to figure things
out, good specific examples are especially important because you will
lean hard on emulating examples, so having good examples to emulate is
crucial.</p>
<h3 id="postscript">Postscript</h3>
<p>This is where I stalled. I’m not quite sure why. I think partly the
post was getting too long, and I didn’t know how to continue, or I ran
out of energy.</p>
<p>It’s a known problem that I’m very bad at revisiting things once I’ve
stopped writing them, and as a result I tend to fail to finish longer
pieces. I would like to work on that but have not yet managed.</p>
