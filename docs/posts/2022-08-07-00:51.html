<p>NB: This post is unfinished but it accidentally got added to the
index and people keep asking about it, so I decided to publish it as
is.</p>
<p>One of my lesser known but surprisingly impactful contributions to
the world is the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkusHEBOhmQ">Easy solutions to
hard problems</a>, which is about mixed integer linear programming
(MILP) and in particular about how to use integer linear programming to
schedule conferences. Off the back of this, several conferences,
including <a href="https://www.emfcamp.org/">Electromagnetic field</a>
have scheduled their conferences using MILP.</p>
<p>I now think that was a mistake. Sorry.</p>
<p>There are roughly three problems with this approach:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s actually really slow. Not as slow as scheduling it by hand
maybe, but the EMF scheduler apparently takes most of a day to run.</li>
<li>It gives totally opaque error messages when things go wrong.</li>
<li>Every time I’ve attended a conference scheduled this way I’m left
with a vague sense that the schedule is just not very good. It’s a bit
all over the place in a way that I feel like a human scheduler would
have done better.</li>
</ol>
<p>Set against this, you really <em>do</em> want a computer in the loop
because scheduling things by hand is such a nightmare that this is still
preferable for the organisers despite the trade off.</p>
<p>Anyway I was thinking about this recently and realised that there’s
probably a nicer way to do this.</p>
<p>The basic design is to follow the model from <a href="http://oro.open.ac.uk/3275/4/Can_a_machine_design.pdf">Can a
machine design?</a> for human-machine collaboration, which is that it is
the job of a computer to propose solutions and for the human to correct
them. So instead of designing a <em>scheduler</em> we are effectively
designing a <em>schedule editor</em>. The computer proposes an initial
schedule, which is expected to not be especially good, and then
maintains the schedule and all its constraints as the human makes edits
to it.</p>
<p>This solves the problem of the schedule missing the human touch,
because the human can make changes until they’re happy with the
schedule, and it’s the job of the computer to make those changes
work.</p>
<p>The UI I’m imagining this is essentially a version of the schedule,
in which a user can drag things around and have everything reorder
itself to make it work.</p>
<p>The basic operations I’m imagining are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lock a talk into the slot it’s currently scheduled in, so it will
not be moved in future.</li>
<li>Move a talk into a new slot, replacing the talk that’s currently
there. This will either succeed, or the software will say that it’s
forbidden (because the talk is not allowed into that slot because of
e.g. constraints on when the speaker can manage), or that it has to
unlock the following talks in order to make it work (with an explanation
of why).</li>
</ol>
<p>Many more operations are implementable (e.g. you could easily
implement a “Move this talk somewhere else, I don’t care where as long
as it fits the requirement” operation), these are just the obvious
basics.</p>
<p>Implementing the UI for this should be relatively straightforward for
anyone who is actually good at UI. I’m not, and I’m not invested enough
in this problem to want to pick up the relevant skills. If you’re
interested in this problem and already good at UI, feel free to drop me
a line and talk about collaborating on this, because I pretty much know
how all the algorithmic details should work!</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>These operations are relatively easy to implement, and the basic
algorithmic toolkit for this is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%27s_marriage_theorem">Hall’s
marriage theorem</a>. Hall’s marriage theorem says that if you have some
set of items (talks) you want to put into boxes (slots in the schedule),
and each item can only go in some boxes (each talk can only be scheduled
in certain slots), and each box can only hold one item (each slot can
only have one talk), then either you can find an assignment that works,
or you can find some set of items which is strictly larger than the
number of boxes that are allowed to hold those items. e.g. there are
three slots but four talks that all have to go in one of those three
slots.</p>
<p>Hall’s marriage theorem is relatively easy to implement an efficient
algorithm for if you have access to an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopcroft%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm">Hopcroft-Karp
algorithm</a> (and fortunately <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csgraph.maximum_bipartite_matching.html">scipy
has just such an implementation</a>). You use this to find the largest
possible assignment of items to boxes. If this assigns every item to a
box, great you’re done. If not, you can use the unassigned items to
construct a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_violator">Hall
violator</a> - a set of items that cannot possibly be put into distinct
boxes because there aren’t enough boxes.</p>
<p>As a side note, one nice thing about this algorithm is that it has
the opposite efficiency characteristics to using MILP for this: The more
constrained your problem gets, the faster it runs. As a result, it
should (I think) be viable to use it the way I need to use it for this
design, because we’ll mostly want to run it with quite constrained
problems.</p>
<p>(You can also use MILP to solve the maximum matching problem and it
may under some circumstances me more efficient to do that. This is
something that would require experimentation. Certainly using a MILP
gets you more flexibility than using Hall’s theorem, because it lets you
handle things like “these two talks shouldn’t clash” natively)</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s easy enough to use Hall’s marriage theorem for the
initial schedule: You just run it on your constraints, and it either
gives you a schedule or tells you that you e.g. have too many talks that
have to go into a particular day.</p>
<p>Here’s how to use it to power what should be a pretty good schedule
editor:</p>
<p>You always have a current schedule that you are working on. In
response to requests from the user, the scheduler makes (ideally small)
edits to the schedule by rearranging sets of talks.</p>
<p>Each talk has an epoch, which is the last time it was moved. The goal
is to have the schedule converge to stability, so we always prefer to
move talks that are from a more recent epoch. Initially, all talks are
given a random distinct epoch. A talk may also be locked (as marked by
the user), in which case it will not be moved without the user asking.
We will also sometimes temporarily lock talks as part of a
rescheduling.</p>
<p>When a user moves a talk to a new slot, the following happens:</p>
<p>First, check if the talk is allowed in its new slot (i.e. it
satisfies the constraints as to which rooms, times, etc the talk is
allowed in). If not, complain to the user and don’t move it.</p>
<p>Second, if the talk that is already there is allowed in the slot
you’re moving out of, swap the two. Similarly if the slot is empty
because you don’t have a full schedule, just move the talk there.</p>
<p>Finally, if</p>
