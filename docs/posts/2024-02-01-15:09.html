<p>I’ve been travelling for the last 12 days and during this time
something really weird happened: I didn’t get ill during the entire
trip.</p>
<p>This <em>never</em> happens. I get ill constantly at the best of
times, and I was in a new environment, surrounded by people,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Admittedly mostly in well ventilated spaces, and I
masked when in airports though not on airplanes.</span> and extremely worn down.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I also got exposed to COVID on day 1, though I’ve had it
recently enough that I’m probably pretty immune, and we were outside so
it was probably safe.</span></p>
<p>I definitely felt like I <em>started</em> getting ill a few times. I
got the telltale sore throat that is a common beginning of illness for
me, and there was one evening that I felt a little bit under the
weather… and each time this then just immediately went away.</p>
<p>This is extremely surprising, but I have a theory. It’s not a good
enough theory that I have any confidence in it yet, but it’s got a
plausible mechanism of action for causing this, and seems enough worth
trying that I’m going to keep going for a bit and see what happens.</p>
<p>The mechanism is this: While travelling, I was using <a href="https://smartmouth.com/">Smartmouth zinc-activated mouthwash</a>.
I ran into it because I was looking for zinc lozenges<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Which I do low key believe fend off colds, but
admittedly based on very weak evidence relative to their level of
inconvenience</span> and
could only find homeopathic ones, but I also needed mouth wash, saw
this, and reckoned it was worth a go.</p>
<p>The basic idea as to why this, or zinc lozenges, might work is that
zinc is antiviral (as well as being antibacterial, which is its major
intended purpose in Smartmouth), so coating your mouth with zinc kills
off any virus living in your throat. This lines up with my experience of
starting to get sore throats and have them mysteriously go away.</p>
<p>Is this a real effect? Unsure. Probably not. I think it’s worth
exploring further from a <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/2022/10/13/my-resentful-story-of-becoming-a-medical-miracle/">luck-based
medicine</a> point of view though.</p>
<p>Other plausible theories include:</p>
<ul>
<li>I really wasn’t exposed to that much virus with the quality of the
air filtration where I was.</li>
<li>I was running on adrenaline, and now I’m about to get sick now that
this has calmed down a bit.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This isn’t consistent with when I normally get ill while
travelling though.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Mostly I’m just preregistering the theory.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And wanted an easy post I could phone in having just
arrived home from a very long flight.</span>
I’ll continue trying it for a while and see what happens.</p>
