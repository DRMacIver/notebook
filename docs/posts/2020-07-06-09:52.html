<p>Bad news feelings-readers, it’s another technical post. Having
feelings will resume shortly (probably in tomorrow’s newsletter if
nothing else)</p>
<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1278986162443636736">asked
the other day</a> about how to find the shortlex-predecessor of a string
in a regular language represented by a DFA. I eventually came up with <a href="https://gist.github.com/DRMacIver/89a7a27b70bbb795748fd20d1ad50f82">a
solution that wasn’t too bad</a>. This morning in the shower I came up
with a better one (disclaimer: I haven’t written code for this or tested
it, so it’s probably subtly wrong and has off by one errors, and it may
perform poorly, but the basic idea is sound in theory).</p>
<p>The basic idea is this: It’s well known that using breadth first
search we can enumerate the regular language in shortlex-ascending order
as <span class="math inline">\(x_0, \ldots, x_n, \ldots\)</span>.
Finding the predecessor of <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> given
this enumeration is as simple as looking up <span class="math inline">\(s = x_n\)</span> and returning <span class="math inline">\(x_{n - 1}\)</span>. Unfortunately, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> may be exponentially large in <span class="math inline">\(|s|\)</span> so doing the enumeration is horribly
impractical.</p>
<p>But! It turns out, you don’t have to, and this solution can be made
workable (given a good bigint library to represent the indices) as
follows:</p>
<p>Maintain a dynamic programming table <span class="math inline">\(C(i,
k)\)</span> which counts the number of accepted strings of length <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> starting from state <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the DFA. Also maintain a dynamic
programming table <span class="math inline">\(R(i, k) = \sum\limits_{j =
0}^k C(i, j)\)</span> (i.e. the number of strings of length at most
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> accepted from state <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>).</p>
<p>What this table lets you do is essentially skip over the bits of the
breadth first search that you know won’t lead to where you’re going, and
count how many strings you skipped by doing so.</p>
<p>Now, you look up <span class="math inline">\(x_n\)</span> by first
comparing values of <span class="math inline">\(R(0, k)\)</span> to find
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(R(0, k) &lt; n \leq R(0, k + 1)\)</span>. We know
<span class="math inline">\(k = |x_n|\)</span>. Now, walk the DFA, using
<span class="math inline">\(C(i, k)\)</span> to determine which node to
transition to (using essentially the same idea - this is easier to
explain in code, but I haven’t written the code yet!).</p>
<p>Now, to find <span class="math inline">\(x_n = s\)</span> we just
count the number of strings in the langugage which are shortlex smaller
than <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. This can be established
relatively easily: First count <span class="math inline">\(R(0, |s| -
1)\)</span>, all strings that are shorter than <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, and then work out the number of
strings of length <span class="math inline">\(|s|\)</span> that are
lexicographically smaller than <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> by
adding up sum of the strings of length <span class="math inline">\(k -
i\)</span> by walking the DFA and after reading <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> characters count the number of strings
of length <span class="math inline">\(|s| - i - 1\)</span> that you
would get from following each <span class="math inline">\(c &lt;
s_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>To be honest, I think this explanation was all clear as mud, sorry. I
think either you’ll get the idea immediately from the initial seed of
“Use dynamic programming to get the indices” or the explanation won’t
clarify it, and I should have written the code instead of trying to
explain this in prose. Alternatively, this is a sign that I really need
to get much better at explaining this sort of thing in prose.</p>
