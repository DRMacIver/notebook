<p>As far as things that are likely to trigger a massive crisis of faith
go, flipping through a social epistemology textbook (<a href="https://amzn.to/2Em7J5A">Social Epistemology: Essential
Readings</a>) and reading a highly technical chapter with lots of
numbers in it probably not ranked very highly, but there we go.</p>
<p>The chapter in question was <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/5830/1/Group_knowledge_and_group_rationality_%28LSERO%29.pdf">Group
knowledge and group rationality: a judgement aggregation
perspective</a>, and it pointed out the following fairly fundamental
problem.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a proposition <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and people believe it independently
with probablity <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Then for large
populations, with overwhelmingly high probability the majority vote on
whether it’s true will be yes if <span class="math inline">\(p &gt;
0.5\)</span>, no if <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; 0.5\)</span>. How
large the population has to be is mostly determined by how far <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is from <span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose you have two true propositions <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and people believe each with
probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. As a result, they
believe the proposition <span class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span>
(<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>) with probability <span class="math inline">\(p^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now suppose we have <span class="math inline">\(0.5 &lt; p &lt;
0.7\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.5\)</span>, so
the majority believe each of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(p^2 &lt; 0.49 &lt; 0.5\)</span>, so the majority
<em>disbelieve</em> <span class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span>.
This means that if you put each of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> to the vote separately that you will
conclude that <span class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span> is true,
but if you put <span class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span> to the
vote on its own you will conclude it is false.</p>
<p>The situation gets worse the more conjunctions you add. If you want
to get the same answer for three propositions then you need <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; 0.79\)</span>. Eventually, you need almost
everyone to be entirely right about everything to get the correct
outcome.</p>
<p>This is only a model, and the underlying assumptions are certainly
unrealistic, but I do think it points to a true problem: Individual
people are much more likely to be correct about premises than
conclusions. I was aware of this as a possibility before, but I hadn’t
previously appreciated that it wasn’t just possible but overwhelmingly
normal.</p>
<p>The problem is that almost everything we vote on is not a premise but
a conclusion. Democracy has essentially two functions that are being
conflated:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the desired end state of the world?</li>
<li>What is the best way to achieve that?</li>
</ul>
<p>You are aggregating both values and judgement, and you are doing so
with exactly the sort of conflation of things that we’ve just shown
can’t possibly be expected to work well.</p>
<p>What’s the solution? I don’t know. It’s certainly not a dictatorship
(which has its own worse problems) and markets have essentially the same
issue. I need to think about this more.</p>
