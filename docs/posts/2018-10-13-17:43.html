<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pHhRt2q3K6KfFE5kd/nyoom">Nyoom</a>
by Alicorn is a lovely piece about her new mobility scooter. There’s a
refrain throughout that hit me particularly hard:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not like, you know, really disabled.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I wasn’t <em>disabled</em> or anything!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Because I thought I wasn’t disabled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I hate this idea that “disabled” is a binary category that you either
are or aren’t. There’s no magic threshold at which it’s suddenly OK to
need help. Everyone needs help, and if something helps you you should do
it.</p>
<p>I don’t think Alicorn disagrees with this, and I think this is
probably a deliberate point of the piece, I just want to emphasise
it.</p>
<p>The world is <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/06/on-not-quite-fitting/">full of
threshold effects</a> where we take some continuous spectrum and declare
that everything that is past this point counts and everything that’s not
doesn’t. This is bullshit.</p>
<p>You see this a lot with psychological issues as well, and it ties in
to the war on drugs. There are a lot of drugs that are currently
prescription only that I suspect would be much more widely useful - ADHD
or modafinil for example. Hell, <em>I’d</em> probably benefit from one
or both of these - do I have ADHD? No, I am almost certainly not able to
meet the clinical definition of ADHD, but I’ve had more than one person
look at my output on the internet and go “So, David…”, and I’m
definitely at least halfway in that direction. Do I have a sleep
disorder? Yes, almost certainly. Is it one of the two that you can get
modafinil prescribed for? Nah.</p>
<p>We need to stop thinking of medication and assistive tech and, well,
everything else, in terms of “Here is some discrete set of conditions
that they fix” and more in terms of “this is the class of problems they
help with”. If you have a problem and there is something that would help
you with it, the solution should be available to you regardless of
whether you cross the threshold of “really needing it”.</p>
