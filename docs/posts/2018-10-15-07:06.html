<p>A surprisingly charming book. It sounds like it should be funny, but
it’s not (and I don’t think is intended to be).</p>
<p>Instead the author, a literature professor, discusses the roles of
books in our lives, and how they are interpreted and exist within our
cultural framework and views on the world.</p>
<p>One of his key points is that there is not really a binary of books
we have “read” versus “not read” - every book we have read, we
immediately start to forget, so at some point even books we have
ostensibly read may achieve the same status as books we have never
read.</p>
<p>He uses a cute set of categorisations: UB (book that is unknown to
me), SB (book I have skimmed), HB (book I have heard about), FB (book I
have forgotten), coupled with a rating of –, -, +, ++ to indicate a
negative or positive opinion about them.</p>
<p>I am glad to have read this book for, ironically perhaps, a reason
that I think is the major… if not missed, at least brushed over, point,
which is that I think his view of books is very fiction-centric. What he
is saying is not <em>wrong</em> for non-fiction, but I feel it is
incomplete and elides much of the impact that a book can have on your
thinking. His point is still valuable here - there are many ways to
achieve that impact other than a thorough in-depth reading of the book,
and some of them will even work <em>better</em> than a close reading the
book (e.g. in-depth discussion interspersed with skimming and the
occasional read) - but given that I think of this as one of the major
point of books I would have appreciated more discussion.</p>
<p>On the other hand this is a bit of a “Why didn’t you include…?” and
if he had included everything that could be said on the the subject the
book would have been significantly less pleasingly short, so perhaps it
is best left as is.</p>
<p>Possibly interesting to contrast with “How to Read a Book”.</p>
