<p>Fun Fact: People say that property-based testing was invented in
Haskell but this isn’t actually true. Property-based testing was
invented in Erlang.</p>
<p><em>QuickCheck</em> was invented in Haskell, but they didn’t start
referring to it as property based testing until the Erlang version of
QuickCheck. The term was then widely adopted and came to include the
original Haskell QuickCheck too.</p>
<p>The first time that the term “property-based testing” was used for
this style of testing was in 2006, in “Testing telecoms software with
Quviq QuickCheck”. I asked John Hughes about this and he says that they
were pushed into giving it a better name by Ulf Wiger.</p>
<p>Funnily, there’s a much earlier usage of the term property-based
testing, in the work of George Fink leading up to his PhD thesis. I
didn’t really look into his system in detail, and it doesn’t seem to
have taken off, but as far as I can tell there’s not much relationship
between the two concepts.</p>
