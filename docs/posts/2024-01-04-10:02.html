<p>Another draft bankruptcy post. This is one of those posts that I
started writing because I was annoyed about something (I forget what, I
don’t think it’s present anywhere in the text), and stopped writing when
I lost steam on that annoyance. I still think it’s important and worth
saying, but I lost the impetus to keep saying it.</p>
<p>Advance warning: I am not pulling any punches in this post.</p>
<h3 id="do-you-want-impostor-syndrome-because-thats-how-you-get-impostor-syndrome.">Do
you want impostor syndrome? Because that’s how you get impostor
syndrome.</h3>
<p>For various reasons I’ve been thinking recently about something I
helped a client with a while ago.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Details slightly altered and kept vague for
confidentiality reasons.</span></p>
<p>Roughly the scenario they found themselves in was this: Someone new
had joined their staff, and this person wasn’t <em>bad</em> at their
job, but they were very slow at it, taking much longer to complete basic
tasks than seemed reasonable.</p>
<p>More, this person knew it, and was clearly very bothered by it, and
kept apologising for it. My client kept reassuring them that this was
fine and it was normal to take a while to get started. This didn’t seem
to help, and they kept being anxious about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, a couple of months of this had passed and my client now had a
problem: Their staff member was <em>still</em> too slow at their job. It
could no longer be written off as just slowness getting up to speed,
they actually weren’t fast enough at the job to keep up with the needed
workload, and weren’t showing any signs of improvement.</p>
<p>I’m reasonably confident that the problem isn’t that the client’s
expectations were unreasonable. We talked a bit about it and it was a
set of requirements that it was perfectly normal to expect a person to
be able to do, nothing terribly out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>What I’m <em>not</em> sure about is whether in an alternate history
their subordinate could have been capable of doing the job at that
point. Certainly in this history they weren’t.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Unfortunately I also don’t know if they became so. Due
to a mix of funding changes at the client’s company and me winding down
that part of my business, this was only a month or two before my last
session with that client, so I don’t know how the story ends. It doesn’t
matter for the point I’m making though.</span></p>
<p>And part of why they weren’t is that my client had, bluntly<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Somewhat more bluntly than I put it at the time,
although I think I was at least clear about what they’d done wrong.</span> spent the last couple of months
lying to them about their performance.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the client’s fault. It’s what we’re all trained to do.
When someone is expressing anxiety, you reassure them that the thing
they’re anxious about couldn’t possibly happen and everything will be
fine. When someone is expressing guilt about how they fucked up, you
tell them that it’s not their fault and there’s nothing they could have
done. There’s this deep seated cultural assumption that the way to be
kind to people is that you lie to them.</p>
<p>I hate this and think it’s a travesty.</p>
<p>In the spirit of honesty, I will admit that I do this sometimes. Much
much less than most people do, I think, but it’s hard not to. There are
a lot of forces pushing you to do it. When I find myself doing it, I try
to learn from that and do better in future.</p>
<p>In a similar spirit of honesty, I know that you probably do this too,
and I’m <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/just-disappointed">disappointed</a>
in you for doing so. I would like you to do better.</p>
<p>The reason we all lie to each other like this is often framed as
kindness. I don’t think it is. I think it’s a form of cowardice. Honesty
has consequences that we have to own in a way that dishonesty would not.
If we speak the truth, we are responsible for any hurt inflicted, and
might have to face the other’s negative reaction to our words. If we
tell a nice lie we are not responsible when the problem we are lying
about inevitably has consequences.</p>
<p>Doing better requires both the courage to face those consequences,
and a sense of responsibility for events that are not our “fault” that
everyone is keen to disavow.</p>
<p>The correct way to handle something like my client’s situation is, in
my opinion, to say something along the lines of: Yes, you’re
underperforming compared to what I’d hope for. It’s not a problem yet,
but if it continues it will become one. I’ve got your back in trying to
prevent that. Let’s figure out together what you need to solve this
problem and do our best to get it for you.</p>
<p>This is, of course, taking on a lot of work, and it’s also taking on
a lot of responsibility. Now in the quite likely<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">A sad reality is that many people are in fact not good
enough at the jobs they’ve been hired to do, for reasons that are
outside of anyone’s power to fix, or at least to fix fast enough to be
viable. When this happens it’s important to treat them well, but it’s
also important to not retain them in that role.</span>
event that their subordinate failed to perform and had to be let go at
the end of their probation period, it would be in part be because they
had failed to help them.</p>
<p>Depending on how much capacity is available, that might not be an
option. I was talking to a friend recently about their company’s
situation and he was in a similar position but absolutely didn’t have
the capacity spare to help the person in question learn to perform at
the level he needed (and suspected that they couldn’t or wouldn’t
anyway).</p>
<p>In such a circumstance I honestly think the kindest thing to say to
someone is something along the lines of: Look, this is what we need, and
the fact that you can’t give it is a problem. If you’re willing to take
responsibility for stepping up, we’re happy to give you the space you
need to do that, and can make some changes to support that but cannot
commit a lot of resources. What do you want to do?</p>
<p>This sucks to hear and it sucks to say. This is not going to be an
easy conversation<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And in this particular example and depending on where
you are can run into employment law complications. Not legal advice
etc.</span>, but it is necessary, and the
results of not having it are worse. Again, this is why I think avoiding
conversations like this is a form of moral cowardice. Not having these
conversations allows you to pretend that the failure is not your
responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="you-shouldnt-lie-to-your-friends">You shouldn’t lie to your
friends</h3>
<p>Anyway, I don’t care that much about the employment example right
now. It’s important, but it’s not why this has been on my mind.</p>
<p>I was talking to some friends recently about the advice “when you
find yourself beating yourself up over something, imagine you’re talking
to a friend or loved one and ask if you would talk to them that
way”.</p>
<p>One of the objections to this advice raised is that when talking to a
friend or loved one you will tend to lie to them in the ways I’ve been
discussing. You diminish the degree to which the situation is their
fault, you downplay the possibility of bad consequences. This feels fine
to do to a friend, but bad to do to yourself because you can see through
the ruse.</p>
<p>This objection is a commendable level of self honesty<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Although I think self honesty of this form is often too
“brutal honesty”.</span>,
but also reveals how much we let our friends down.</p>
<p>Because here’s the thing: Your friends can see through the ruse too.
The thing about having a social norm of lying to people is that
<em>everybody knows you lie to people in this way</em>.</p>
<p>Recall the example of my client. One of the problems with lying to
his subordinate is that it didn’t give them the support they needed to
improve. But it <em>also didn’t make them less anxious</em>.</p>
<p>And of course it didn’t. If people are going to tell you that
something isn’t a problem even when it’s a problem, you can’t trust that
reassurance at all, so why would it help?</p>
<p>If you want to be able to reassure people that something isn’t a
problem when it’s not a problem, they need to be able to believe that
you would tell them that it’s a problem if it were one.</p>
<p>You can achieve this belief in one of three ways:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It can be true.</li>
<li>They can have poor judgement.</li>
<li>They can lie to themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, when you lie to people, you either fail to help them, or you
make them complicit in the lie, and at some level that’s hard to
maintain, and it’s bad for them and it’s bad for the relationship.</p>
<h3 id="the-problem-of-brutal-honesty">The problem of brutal
honesty</h3>
<p>Honesty has <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-28-10:26.html">a
differing thresholds problem</a>.</p>
<p>I often get accused of being brutally honest. It’s certainly
sometimes true - I think this post is erring on the side of brutal
honesty, partly because I’m fed up and partly because I don’t think a
softer version would land - but I think actually most of the time I’m
<em>not</em> brutally honest, I’m just honest in situations where other
people wouldn’t be, and this rounds to brutal honesty.</p>
<p>But my primary association with people who self describe as “brutally
honest” is that they tend to care more about the brutal part than the
honest part, and that when you are being “brutally honest” with someone
it tends to be more because you don’t care about their feelings<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Or do care about their feelings, in that you want them
to feel bad.</span> than it is because you care about
telling them the truth.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">That doesn’t mean you’re necessarily <em>not</em>
telling them the truth, but it does usually mean that you’re telling
them only the bits of the truth that hurt the most.</span></p>
<p>I think brutal honesty has a missing mood. Something along the lines
of “It is regrettable that I must hurt this person but the truth is in
this instance more important than their feelings”. Instead, the attitude
seems to be much more “truth hurts, suck it up”. This is not an attitude
I want to encourage.</p>
<h3 id="you-probably-shouldnt-lie-to-yourself-either">You probably
shouldn’t lie to yourself either</h3>
<p>One of the reasons why I’ve been thinking about this recently is that
I was talking about self-help books the other day, and realising that
there’s really one fundamental message that underlies the vast majority
of self help books.</p>
<p>It’s this: You know that problem you’ve been having? It’s not your
fault. You don’t have to feel bad about having it.</p>
<p>Sometimes this is a useful message for people to hear, because it
lets them get a bit of emotional distance from the problem that they
need to solve it.</p>
<p>And if it helps them achieve that, and they then solve the problem,
(Editor’s note: I apparently stopped writing this post mid sentence
here).</p>
<h3 id="postscript">Postscript</h3>
<p>I think I should revisit this theme at some point as honesty is
somewhere where my moral intuitions seem to sharply differ from other
people’s, in a way that causes frictions when ~I’m right and they’re
wrong~ we have differing intuitions about how to e.g. answer a
question.</p>
<p>I do honestly think that my way is better. I’m not blind to its
downsides, and it requires skill to do well<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn9"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn9" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And sometimes I even have that skill!</span>,
but I think the downsides of the status quo are much worse, and choosing
them feels like a sort of collective cowardice to me.</p>
