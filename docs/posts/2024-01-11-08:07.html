<p>Another draft bankruptcy post, though I’m going to continue this on
for a bit as it’s really more of the prompt for a post than a full
abandoned draft.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Some of you get annoyed when I write very culturally bound things
that rely on a lot of shared context. Like Shaka, when the walls fell,
you will not enjoy this post. You may or may not wish to bear with me
anyway.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a post about memes. Mostly of the internet sort, not
the Dawkins sort, although a little bit also of the Dawkins sort.</p>
<h3 id="all-part-of-the-pattern">All part of the pattern</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It was indeed a garden, like a lot of other gardens you got in areas
like Clay Lane. The gray soil was nothing more than old brick dust,
elderly cat mess, and generalized, semirotted dross. At the far end was
a three-hole privy. It was built handily by the gate to the back lane so
the night-soil men didn’t have far to go, but this one had a small stone
cylinder turning gently beside it.</p>
<p>The garden didn’t get much proper light. Gardens like this never did.
You got secondhand light once the richer folk in the taller buildings
had finished with it. Some people kept pigeons or rabbits or pigs on
their plots, or planted, against all experience, a few vegetables. But
it’d take magic beans to reach the real sunlight in gardens like
this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, someone had made an effort. Most of the spare ground
had been covered with gravel of different sizes, and this had been
carefully raked into swirls and curves. Here and there, some individual
larger stones had been positioned, apparently with great thought.</p>
<p>Vimes stared at the garden of rocks, desperate for anything to occupy
his attention.</p>
<p>He could see what the designer had in mind, he thought, but the
effect had been spoiled. This was the big city, after all. Garbage got
everywhere. The main disposal method was throwing it over a wall. Sooner
or later someone would sell it or, possibly, eat it.</p>
<p>A young monk was carefully raking the gravel. He gave a respectful
bow as Sweeper approached.</p>
<p>The old man sat down on a stone bench.</p>
<p>“Push off and get us two cups of tea, lad, will you?” he said. “One
green with yak butter, and Mister Vimes will have it boiled orange in a
builder’s boot with two sugars and yesterday’s milk, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s how I like it,” said Vimes weakly, sitting down.</p>
<p>Sweeper took a deep, long breath. “And I like building gardens,” he
said. “Life should be a garden.”</p>
<p>Vimes stared blankly at what was in front of them.</p>
<p>“Okay,” he said. “The gravel and rocks, yes, I can see that. Shame
about all the rubbish. It always turns up, doesn’t it…”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Lu-Tze. “It’s part of the pattern.”</p>
<p>“What? The old cigarette packet?”</p>
<p>“Certainly. That invokes the element of air,” said Sweeper.</p>
<p>“And the cat doings?”</p>
<p>“To remind us that disharmony, like a cat, gets everywhere.”</p>
<p>“The cabbage stalks? The used [condom]?*”</p>
<p>“At our peril we forget the role of the organic in the total harmony.
What arrives seemingly by chance in the pattern is part of a higher
organization that we can only dimly comprehend. This is a very important
fact, and has a bearing on your case.”</p>
<p>“And the beer bottle?”</p>
<p>For the first time since Vimes had met him, the monk frowned.</p>
<p>“Y’know, some bugger always tosses one over the wall on his way back
from the pub on Friday nights. If it wasn’t forbidden to do that kind of
thing, he’d feel the flat to my hand and no mistake.”</p>
<p>“It’s not part of the higher organization?”</p>
<p>“Possibly. Who cares? That sort of thing gets on my thungas, it
really does,” said Sweeper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage is one of various things the world has chucked over the
wall into my mind. I like to imagine that the garden has been raked
around the rubbish in the same way as it would any large rock or
intrusion into it.</p>

<p>This is often how my mind feels to me. Things appear in it from the
world and stay there, patterns radiating outwards, interfering and
interacting and creating something unique and sometimes beautiful
patterns, but it often starts from garbage.</p>
<h3 id="trekkies-watching-darmok">Trekkies, watching Darmok</h3>
<p>The “Star Trek: The Next Generation” episode “Darmok” is about a race
of aliens whose communication style does not correctly translate,
because everything they say is in terms of analogy to previous
events.</p>
<p>Editor’s note: I think I stopped writing this post because this
section was boring. Please insert any one of various standard takes
about how the way we communicate on the internet is like this.</p>
<h3 id="the-associative-value-of-memes">The associative value of
memes</h3>
<p>Because what I actually wanted to talk about was the use of memes for
thinking rather than about how we talk with them.</p>
<p>Some of this is just the usual straightforward way that any language
is a tool for thought: Having a concept for a thing allows you to think
about the thing.</p>
<p>But memes have an unusual sticking power, because of the richness of
the concept. They usually have an image with a quite specific vibe
associated with them. Sometimes they undergo enough evolution that they
leave the image behind, but even there there’s a whole web of
associations that helps make them feel really accessible and live.</p>
<p>I’ve talked about a related phenomenon in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/reading-philosophy-for-the-examples">Reading
philosophy for the examples</a>, where having a whole rich example for a
concept makes it much more relevant.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/duck-guy.png"/> <em>Purple suited man riding a
rocket duck, as you do.</em></figure>
<p>Even in that post the images help. I’ve still got a concept for duck
guy that feels quite live,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I still don’t really know how to talk to him, though I
suspect I’m better at it than most.</span> and Danny at the Grand
Canyon also sticks around, but I had to look up the rest.</p>
<p>The particularly useful function of memes as a tool of thought though
is the way they spring unbidden to mind.</p>
<p>For example, a useful meme to acquire recently has been “Stop. Look.
Think. Are you eating yourself?”</p>
<p><img src="/images/ouroboros.png"/> <em><a href="https://topatoco.com/products/og-ouroboros">Buy the T-shirt
here</a></em></p>
<p>When stuck in unhelpful patterns, it’s helpful to remember this goofy
little guy and ask if I’m currently eating myself.</p>
<p>Another good related tool comes from catchy songs. Discord got a bit
obsessed with the song Diggy Diggy Hole for a while:<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I can’t imagine how this could possibly have happened
and definitely accept no culpability in it…</span></p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ytWz0qVvBZ0?si=8JxlPuz0o1eb6dZw" title="YouTube video player" width="560">
</iframe>
<p>It became a bit of an injoke for a while to come up with many
variations of this to the tune of verby verby noun<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I am on discord and I’m verbing a noun. verby verby
noun. verby verby noun.</span>,
but the one that’s really usefully stuck is that when you’re caught in
that annoying state of endlessly browsing the internet, doomscrolling,
etc. you’re in a clicky clicky loop.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Clicky clicky loop. Clicky clicky loop…</span> Having this concept
available is often enough to break you out of it when the music starts
playing in your head.</p>
<p>And of course, there’s the eagle that makes me go outside whenever I
think about it:<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This hasn’t actually worked very well recently, but in
my defence it’s been cold and dark and wet and I don’t like. Admittedly
this is also the eagle’s vibe so this isn’t much of a defence.</span></p>
<p><img src="/images/stupid-little-walk.png"/> <em>An eagle going on a
stupid little daily walk for it stupid physical and mental
health.</em></p>
<p>I partly think of these posts as my stupid little daily writing for
my stupid mental health.</p>
<h3 id="no-private-language">No private language</h3>
<p>I think an important feature of memes is that they’re social. Very
few of these things would have stuck without a community of people
reinforcing them.</p>
<p>Partly this is because talking about the meme makes it more salient,
part of this is because I think a group is much better at building memes
that are optimised to work.</p>
<p>I think there are probably useful magical practices (sigil creation
etc) that do pull off this sort of trick privately, but personally I’ve
never got them to work. I think it’s important to me that eagle and
ouroboros are shared concepts for the things they represent.</p>
<p>Maybe this is something communities should do a bit more
intentionally though. Crafting and selecting memes for their common
problems. I’m not really sure what this would look like, but it’s worth
thinking about.</p>
