<p>“Fix a man’s feet, and you will make him comfortable for a month.
Teach a man to walk properly, and you will make him comfortable for
life. Therefore denying people access to good foot education is key to
monthly recurring revenue.” - Ancient Capitalist Proverb.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on being good at feet.</p>
<p>Being bad at feet sounds ridiculous, right? Almost as ridiculous as
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-11-09:32.html">being
bad at breathing</a>. I am bad at both feet and breathing, and I’d wager
that many of you reading this are too.</p>
<p>One of the reasons you can tell that I am bad at feet is that I’ve
spent the last 10-15 years in semiconstant pain. Not, you know, a
<em>lot</em> of pain. Just a dull ache in most of the joints of my right
leg that waxes and wanes but never really goes away. I’ve always been a
bit reluctant to identify as someone who experiences chronic pain - it
doesn’t really match the definition of chronic pain, you know, other
than being pain and being chronic - other people have it much worse than
me (this is a bullshit line of thinking and I know it’s a bullshit line
of thinking. I have now more or less <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">reconciled
the alief</a> and recognised that, but it took a while).</p>
<p>Another way in which I am bad at feet is that standing for long
periods of time is painful. Walking is generally fine, but if I stand
for more than about half an hour my legs will be very sad and probably
hate me the next day.</p>
<p>I’ve at various points tried to get medical professionals to take
these problems seriously, but it’s never worked very well. The best I
got is about a year and a half ago I got custom insoles made. They…
maybe helped a bit? Not much.</p>
<p>But now, in one of the rare upsides of the world going to hell, my
chronic pain is at the lowest it’s been since my early 20s - it’s not
gone, but it’s mostly retreated to a vague twinge in my hip (which is
where all this started). I attribute this largely to the almost total
lack of wearing shoes, especially as it’s accelerated since I’ve
switched to barefoot shoes for running.</p>
<p>Standing for long periods of time is still a bit tricky, so I’m
working on arch strength. I’ve switched to working standing in twenty
minute stints recently, and doing a bunch of exercises for strengthening
my arches, added a nightly (self) foot massage to my care routine, and
I’m looking into toe straightening (one of the structural failings of my
feet is that my outer toes curl inwards. I’m pretty sure this is
related, because combining arch exercises with toe straightening is
excruciating). These might or might not work, but I’m hopeful.</p>
<p>Anyway, this isn’t really a post about feet. This is a post about
being bad at things.</p>
<p>At no point in the more than a decade that I’ve been dealing with
this problem did I consider that the root issue of my chronic pain might
be that I was using my feet wrong. I knew that the problem with standing
was related to flat feet, but I thought of that as an intrinsic
structural issue rather than something that I could work on by changing
how I use my feet. At no point did it occur to me that feet were a
foundational skill that I could just work on getting better at and that
this would significantly improve my life.</p>
<p>How much would it improve my life? Hard to say. Not being in constant
pain is a pretty good improvement to start with but consider also…</p>
<ul>
<li>I am bad at sleep. Some of that is due to the aforementioned being
bad at breathing, but some of it is due to the fact that being in pain
makes it hard to sleep!</li>
<li>I am bad at socialising in groups, especially parties. How much of
that is because group social situations tend to involve a lot of
standing, so I tend to be tired and in pain for a lot of them, which
gives me fewer opportunities to get good at groups and also gives me
negative associations with them?</li>
</ul>
<p>(As an aside, being bad at standing is something I’ve mentioned
before as an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-23-09:37.html">illegible
marginalisation</a>)</p>
<p>I’m not saying that these are the only causes, because <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-11:43.html">very
little is monocausal</a>. I’m saying that among the weird and varied
landscapes of life, these have exerted consistent pressure in some
fairly negative directions.</p>
<p>I suspect there are a lot of foundational skills like this, and we
currently don’t have any infrastructure for identifying them, or
learning to be better at them.</p>
<p>This is particularly problematic because being bad at these
foundational skills is something you can kinda get away with early on -
you have more energy to power through them, and have not been subjected
to the constant low-grade degradation of your body (or mind! Much of the
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">emotions
as legacy code</a> model plays out this way too) that being bad at these
skills causes, so by the time you start to notice the effects you’re at
the point where you feel like you should have life sorted out and you
just treat these as the inevitable consequences of aging, when really
they’re a sign that you need to relearn a foundational skill.</p>
