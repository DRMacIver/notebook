<h1 id="consensually-treating-people-as-things">Consensually treating
people as things</h1>
<p>Here’s a section from a post that I didn’t manage to get any of the
real meat of written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s no greys, only white that’s got grubby. I’m surprised you
don’t know that. And sin, young man, is when you treat people like
things. Including yourself. That’s what sin is.”</p>
<p>“It’s a lot more complicated than that--”</p>
<p>“No. It ain’t. When people say things are a lot more complicated than
that, they means they’re getting worried that they won’t like the truth.
People as things, that’s where it starts.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sure there are worse crimes--”</p>
<p>“But they <em>starts</em> with thinking about people as
things...”</p>
<p>- the Reverend Mightily Oats and Granny Weatherwax, in conversation
in Terry Pratchett’s “Carpe Jugulum”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this post I will be going “Yes, people as things, very bad. Quite
sinful. But… sure is useful, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Moreover, if we take this definition seriously, I think most of
modern civilization can reasonably be considered a technology of sin.
The whole <em>point</em> of markets and supply chains is that we can
treat these complex systems that are made mostly of people as things to
achieve a particular purpose. A supermarket is a thing for acquiring
stuff we want, and we get to mostly ignore the fact that it’s made up of
people. Sure, we interact with supermarket staff a bit, and we hopefully
treat them well, but this ignores the giant invisible mass of people
behind them - delivery, warehouse workers, factories, etc.</p>
<p>I’ve written about this before in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/the-usefulness-of-bad-people">The
usefulness of bad people</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The core of this problem is is that the price system works as a black
box, hiding the implementation of where things come from from its
consumers.</p>
<p>Modern supply chains and commodity markets are an incredibly
intricate system of interdependent parts that is far too complex to
really understand. This complexity is, in fact, part of the benefit,
because it grants us plausible deniability around the ethics of our
actions. If everything is too complex to track then we don’t have to
notice all of the bad people downstream of our decisions.</p>
<p>Importantly, as with the sales people, we never <em>ask</em> those
people to be bad, we just say “I want this thing at this price, the
details are up to you” and get to be shocked, shocked I say, when the
only way to provide the thing at that price is slavery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, for all its flaws, I’m not quite prepared to say “Well,
modern civilization is built on sin, burn it to the ground”. I
<em>like</em> modern civilization and, more importantly, don’t actually
think this is a net increase in treating people like things. The past
was pretty bad for this too.</p>
<p>Also, for the most part, being treated as a thing in this way can be
perfectly fine. A lot of the nice thing about a job is that you
<em>don’t</em> have to bring your whole self to work. You can narrowly
act in a specific capacity for achieving a well defined goal, without
your customers having to worry about what you get done outside of the
job, or you having to worry about the whole giant tangled mess of your
life there.</p>
<p>But this is only true if you got to choose that. Being a thing that
is a high priced software consultant is a very different experience than
being a thing that is an exploited worker in a cocoa plantation. The
latter might theoretically have consented (in that it’s better than the
alternative), or they might be literal slaves who have no choice but to
be there, but either way</p>
<p>I think the moral resolution to this is something along the
following: The problem with treating people as things is not that you
are treating them as things, it is one of consent. When your conception
of someone as a thing combines with your power over them, you force
thingness upon them. It’s quite literally a form of objectification.</p>
<h3 id="postscript">Postscript</h3>
<p>This was in fact meant to be a post about the use of “Focus” in
Vernor Vinge’s novel “A Deepness in the Sky”, and what this tells us
about group dynamics. But I didn’t write any of that bit, because I got
too caught up in justifying that the thing I wanted to write about
wasn’t morally bad, honest.</p>
