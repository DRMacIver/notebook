<p>Since my last post on <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-04-26-07:48.html">Lashon
Hara</a> I’ve done a bit more reading, including an English translation
of <a href="https://amzn.to/2JbnLnY">the Sefer Chofetz Chaim</a> (which
I don’t particularly recommend), and <a href="http://rclhistorys15.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/91566363/Jewish%20Laws%20of%20Speech.pdf">“Jewish
Laws of Speech: Towards a Multicultural Rhetoric” by Erika Falk</a>,
which I do.</p>
<p>There has also been an interesting test case of this in the Python
community recently, which is <a href="https://vorpus.org/blog/why-im-not-collaborating-with-kenneth-reitz/">njs’s
post about Kenneth Reitz</a>. This is unambiguously Lashon Hara (well
except in the sense that the concept doesn’t apply because they’re not
as far as I know Jewish), and by repeating it and discussing it we’re
undoubtedly committing sins of spreading and believing Lashon Hara (same
caveats). It turns out I’m OK with this.</p>
<p>The strong impression I get reading the Sefer Chofetz Chaim was that
it was a set of norms that was really not very interested in minimizing
harm to individuals, but was instead designed to promote community
cohesion and conformance. I can see why that would be a useful thing in
many contexts, but I don’t think it is a set of structures I’d want to
emulate. In particular, I don’t think I could willingly accept the
standards of evidence required, which require at least two first hand
witnesses before an accusation is to be believed.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting set of norms, and one that I think is worth
thinking about when designing community norms, but ultimately I think I
will continue to spread Lashon Hara and hope the fact that I’m only a
bit Jewish will protect me from any divine retribution that may be
forthcoming.</p>
<p>Another thing that was linked to as a result of the Lashon Hara
discussions were the <a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/these-3-questions-will-immediately-increase-your-emotional-intelligence.html">three
vital questions</a>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Does this need to be said?</li>
<li>Does this need to be said <em>by me</em>?</li>
<li>Does this need to be said by me <em>now</em>?</li>
</ol>
<p>I like these much better as a framework to think about limiting your
own speech, but will note that I might often find myself answering “No,
but it would amuse me to do so, so I will”.</p>
