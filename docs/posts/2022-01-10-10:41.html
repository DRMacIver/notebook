<p>One of the worst things about me is that I’m fairly unreliable.</p>
<p>Much of it is for reasons beyond my control. It always feels like an
exaggeration to describe myself as “chronically ill”, but I am on a
literal reading of the phrase chronically ill. I get ill a lot. I spent
all of December ill, more or less, between one virus or another. Started
out with what was either a mild flu or a really bad cold, extended it
with a fairly strong reaction to my COVID booster, and then kept daisy
chaining new viruses on top of that, getting a new one each time I was
feeling better from the last one. It sucked.</p>
<p>Then there are the days where I just wake up feeling terrible for no
obvious reason and it doesn’t let up. <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1480595949671964674">Apparently
based on polling on Twitter this is not uncommon</a> which is, I guess…
not exactly a relief, but misery loves company. It’s certainly
concerning that the numbers are that large.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html">recent
major sleep problems</a> are also adding to this of course - sometimes I
wake up and I’ve not had nearly enough sleep. Even before that my
quality of sleep is highly variable. I used to think of this as a “sleep
problem” in that I woke up feeling terrible and attributed that to a
result of sleep, and it lingered, but I’m no longer totally sure this is
the case. It certainly could be (e.g. one candidate cause is mouth
breathing at night).</p>
<p>This sort of day to day unreliability makes it very visible to me how
bad most work arrangements are for people who can’t manage to reliably
show up every day for a job. I’m not quite that bad in that I can
<em>show up</em>, but my level of function on a given day may not be
meaningfully different from if I didn’t. Fortunately I’m good enough at
my job that most of my employers have never really noticed - I can just
about fake function in a meeting, and my work on the good days tends to
be more than enough to make up for the rest.</p>
<p>This is kinda what I mean by it feeling like an exaggeration to say
I’m chronically ill. People with more severe chronic illnesses often
can’t clear that bar, or need more accommodation. Nevertheless, it sucks
and I don’t like it.</p>
<p>Anyway, this isn’t really intended to be complaining about my health,
though maybe I should write about that as well some time.</p>
<p>A lot of the basis of my unreliability seems more emotional in
nature. Maybe some of the emotions are underwritten by the physical
unreliability, I don’t know.</p>
<p>I’m also really unreliable for things at longer time scales. It’s
very hard for me to commit to things over a long period of time, because
over time they acquire this massive… ugh isn’t quite right. It’s not
that they’re aversive, it’s that the very idea of them feels exhausting.
I’ve had a few things that haven’t gone this way - for example I have
managed to maintain a writing habit over a period of decades - but
writing feels like more of a skill than a project. I have this problem
just as badly with writing projects.</p>
<p>This is also, in large part, while I failed to complete my PhD. It
hit the point where I just couldn’t bear to work on it, so I didn’t.</p>
<p>It also shows up on a day to day basis - I make a vague plan to do
things and then never follow through. I set intentions to e.g. have a
habit of cleaning regularly, and don’t. A lot of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html">drifting</a>
happens when there are plenty of things that I could be doing that
past-me intended to do and I intend future-me to do.</p>
<p>I’m aware this is yet another post that will cause people to say
“David, you have ADHD” but I really don’t think so. I’m certainly
somewhat in that direction, but the assessment tests think I don’t meet
the threshold, and stimulants don’t seem to help this problem all that
much. Also my internal experience doesn’t feel like it’s all that much
like people with ADHD describe theirs as.</p>
<p>I was going to claim that I don’t feel wracked with guilt over this,
and I guess this is true, but there’s definitely a certain undercurrent
of shame to this, and especially to talking about it.</p>
<p>In particular the way we treat reliability as a moral responsibility
really adds to that. I do, largely, endorse that. I would like to be
reliable, both for myself and other people, and think I would be a
better person if I could be.</p>
<p>One way of doing that is not trying and just having better support
structures. Being more reliable is definitely one of the things I most
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-02-12:34.html">want
help</a> on, but I have no idea how other people can help me on this.
Working in a company does that to some degree, but going and working for
someone else increasingly doesn’t feel like the right fit. Definitely
one of my fantasies for once my current business takes off in a big way
(hopefully a when not an if) is having a PA to help keep me organised,
but that only really scratches the surface of the problem - really I
need collaborators. I’m not going to stay remotely on task for as long
as I’d like to on a big project without some external assistance.</p>
<p>A lot of this is something I feel like there should be pre-existing
structures for. Or at least it’s something I <em>want</em> there to be
pre-existing structures for me to slot into. Maybe there are, maybe I
just slipped through the cracks, but I don’t think so.</p>
<p>The smart but unreliable person is pretty common, and we’re very
useful if you can give us the right support, but it increasingly feels
taboo to even think about providing that support, let alone asking for
it. You’re supposed to be reliable on your own, and aren’t entitled to
anyone else’s help in being so. How are you supposed to learn to be
reliable if you’re not automatically? Well, figuring that out is your
responsibility too. Tough luck if you can’t manage it.</p>
<p>In many ways this would be easier if it were ADHD. As well as being
potentially manageable with medication (though truthfully I’m pretty
reluctant to consider medication for my problems that feel like they
have an emotional underpinning. No judgement to anyone else who does,
this just feels like the wrong solution for me), ADHD gives you more of
a social license to ask for accommodations - it’s not my fault, I have
ADHD, so you have to take that into account. Whether people <em>do</em>
take it into account is another story, but in principle the option is
there.</p>
<p>I don’t really know that I want accommodations anyway. I don’t think
of the things I want as accommodations - accommodations are things you
give people to help them fit into a place in the world that is
fundamentally not designed for them. Often this is much better than the
alternative, which is that you <em>don’t</em> help them fit in and just
let them suffer, but it’s not ideal.</p>
<p>Really what I want is some mix of figuring out the underlying issues,
both health and emotions, that allow me to be more reliable, and build a
part of the world that fits me.</p>
