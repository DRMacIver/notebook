<p>One of the things in my bags of tricks is using random prompts for
things. What should I write about today? IDK, draw a tarot card, flip to
a random page of a book. Write something in response to it.</p>
<p>Another thing in my bag of tricks is making big lists. Can’t think of
anything? Think of 100 things instead! Can’t think how to start the
list? Come up with a bad idea. Or, even worse, a mediocre one.</p>
<p>Another thing in my bag of tricks is to look at something mundane and
figure out what’s interesting about it. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-23-21:48.html">Cleaning
the kitchen</a> is an example of that. <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/using-what-youre-given">So is
making apples</a>. To some degree the entire <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/my-no-longer-secret-magical-practice">spellcraft
thing</a> is about this.</p>
<p>The point that I’m trying to get at is that with all these tools in
my toolkit, it’s pretty easy for me to solve any drying up of the
creative wellspring. Not only <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-09:44.html">can’t
you run out of ideas</a>, there are reliable procedures for producing
more ideas.</p>
<p>For example, here off the top of my head is a spell for writing a
blog post at the end of the day:</p>
<p>Get a sheet of paper. Write down what you did today - not in detail,
just a list of high level things.</p>
<p>Pick one. If one of them catches your eye, use that, otherwise pick
semi-randomly.</p>
<p>Try to pick out some specific features of it - things that remind you
of other things, or some way it’s unlike other things in that category.
Especially focus on how you made any decisions about it, or how it
felt.</p>
<p>Write about that.</p>
<p>Anyway you’ll notice I’m not using this spell right now. I can’t rule
out that I might in future - I did do the first part of listing out
stuff that happened in my day, and for example I thought I might write
something about some work I’m doing on parsing with derivatives, which I
thought was interesting because of a series of pickles I got myself in
and out of, or I thought I might write about the lunch I made for
myself, in which I took some leftovers from our sunday roast and some
vegetables and turned it into a vaguely Chinese meal.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Fun fact: Left over roast potatoes are great when stir
fried with a bit of ginger.</span>
There’s also something to be said about the experience of waking up, or
<a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/losing-yourself-in-an-audiobook">my
changing relationship with audiobooks</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t though, partially because I’d already started on this,
partially because I didn’t really feel like it.</p>
<p>I’m reading a recent translation of Max Weber’s “Science ad a
Vocation” right now, and the following passage struck me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In both [a laboratory and a factory] it is necessary for somethign,
and the right thing at that, to <em>occur</em> to people if they are to
achieve anything worthwhile.</p>
<p>But inspiration cannot be produced to order. And it has nothing in
common with cold calculation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve also recently been reading “The Cult of Information” by Theodore
Roszak, which is surprisingly good, and it has a similar thing in it
about how a computer-focused education with its heavy emphasis on
procedural thinking cannot possibly teach children the full range of
creative and intuitive thought that we need them to develop.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is that on some level I think they’re wrong.
Intuitively I believe that I really could write a couple of pages of
instructions that you could semi-mechanically follow and produce a
pretty good essay out of. I’m not claiming you could produce
<em>every</em> good essay this way you understand, only that it’s
possible to produce a pretty good generator of essays this way, one that
means that you should never have to suffer the problem of sitting down
in front of the computer and not know what to write.</p>
<p>And yet, every time I think about actually doing this, my soul
rebels.</p>
<p>Things like the random book prompt or tarot prompt or the like seem
mostly fine. The above spell for coming up with something interesting
about your day to report on also seems mostly fine - maybe a little over
constraining, and requires me to look at uncomfortable questions like
“What <em>did</em> I do today?” sometimes, but it’s actually an
interesting exercise.</p>
<p>But if you tell me to, say, roll a die and use it to determine on the
basis of that what to write today, I will fight you.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you tell me that if I’m not sure which one to
write then I <em>get to</em> roll a dice to pick one, that’s just <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-make-easy-decisions">a
spell for making decisions</a>. Great stuff, no complaints. Big fan,
even.</p>
<p>The thing about procedures is that they’re great tools and terrible
masters. The kitchen cleaning procedure is very good because I need to
do the thing and I don’t want to have to make decisions about how to do
the thing. A writing procedure that removes all decisions would be
terrible, because the decisions <em>are</em> the creative process. I can
be aided in making them, but anything that tries to take the ultimate
authority away from me causes me to bristle.</p>
<p>And this is sortof a problem for the goal of creativity on demand,
because the problem isn’t actually that I can’t produce creativity on
demand - I can - it’s that I <em>don’t want to</em>. The whole
experience is one of dragging myself kicking and screaming towards some
goal.</p>
<p>The idea of a fully mechanized process for writing, even one with
explicitly allowances for breaking out of it and doing your own thing,
is still fundamentally designed to take away the first and most
important decision about creating something: Whether you want to do it
at all. Once that decision is taken away from it, the creative part of
my mind mostly just wants to sit there and sulk and refuse to
participate.</p>
<p>And you know what? Too bad. Gonna write anyway. When the dishes gotta
be done, you do the dishes whether you like it or not. When the daily
writing gotta be done, you do the daily writing whether you like it or
not. It’s probably not going to be as bad as you think, and if it is <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/believing-that-you-can-stop">you
can stop</a>, but that’s no reason not to start.</p>
