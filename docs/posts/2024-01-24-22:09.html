<p>Let me tell you about a very specific series of realisations.</p>
<p>First, an observation: I am bad at standing on one leg. Not awful,
just bad. I can do it, but not for long, and I wobble.</p>
<p>For most of my life I just thought of this as an intrinsic fact about
me. Not very good balance, bit uncoordinated, has flat feet, therefore
bad at standing on one leg. It’s only natural.</p>
<p>Anyway, it turns out that if I clench my core muscles and the glute
muscle of the leg I’m standing on, I instantly stabilise. I don’t
completely stop wobbling, but I go from very unstable to pretty stable,
with only a minor wobble.</p>
<p>This isn’t a me thing, that’s normal. Those are just the muscles you
use to stabilise that position, so if you want to stand on one leg you
need to engage them. But, apparently, if I just try to stand on one leg
I don’t engage them enough.</p>
<p>This is an <a href="https://celandine13.livejournal.com/33599.html">errors vs bugs</a>
thing. I’m not “bad at standing on one leg”. There is a specific defect
in how I’m trying to stand on one leg, where I’m not doing one of the
things required.</p>
<p>At some level I find this very counterintuitive. Aren’t muscles just
supposed to… do the thing? Like when I’m walking, I don’t think about
what muscles I’m using. And that’s not just because walking is easy. I
also don’t think about what muscles I’m using when I’m lifting something
heavy.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Though I bet some weight lifter reading this just winced
and went “Of <em>course</em> you’re supposed to pay attention to your
muscles when lifting, you idiot.”</span> You just do the thing and the
muscles you need to do the thing automatically engage, right?</p>
<p>Apparently not, though, at least not for me when it comes to standing
on one leg. Or with many other movements. I’ve been doing pilates
recently, and it’s remarkably easy to do almost the right movement while
using completely the wrong muscles to get the desired effect.</p>
<p>I do expect that people who are good at standing on one leg just do
this automatically. There’s no conscious attention to those muscles,
they just do the thing. This is the unconscious competence stage of the
skill, and I’ve just entered the conscious incompetence stage of the
skill, where I’m still bad at it but I know why I’m bad at it.</p>
<p>But there’s another interesting layer to this: When I stand on one
leg this way it’s <em>hard</em>. I’m better at it, but I can’t
necessarily do it for much longer. The limitation is no longer my
balance, it’s pure muscle strength. Those muscles don’t like clenching
that way. I’m sure this is just a practice thing and is pointing at some
good exercises for me to be doing, but right now I’m weak in a way that
means that even knowing how to do this I’m not actually that much better
at it.</p>
<p>This is probably part of why I’m doing it wrong in the first place:
Doing it right feels much worse. Of course, this is a vicious cycle
where in doing it the “easy” way, I never learn to do it right, and as a
result it never becomes easier because I never develop the strength to
do it the right way.</p>
<p>The solution to this is to practice <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-07-08:50.html">doing
things the hard way</a>, but I think it’s important to notice something:
If I’d just practiced standing on one leg the way I was doing
previously, the results would have been mediocre at best, because the
way I was doing it was not engaging the right muscles and thus was not
something that would have developed strength over time. In order for it
to be useful to practice doing things the hard way, I first had to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-18-10:00.html">figure
out what it was that wasn’t working</a>.</p>
