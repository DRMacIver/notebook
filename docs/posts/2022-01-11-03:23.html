<p>Being human is weird and I don’t really get it.</p>
<p>This may be surprising to you, or it may not, given I’ve probably
spilled most of a million words writing about it, but really that’s how
that works. People aren’t good at explaining things they understand
easily.</p>
<p>But a lot of that is about being a human among other humans. This is,
admittedly, what being human is, and you can’t really separate the human
condition from the experience of other humans, but nevertheless there’s
something about the basic n=1 human experience that I feel like I don’t
get some times.</p>
<p>A while ago I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1085634803381297152">if
people experienced themselves as their body or their body as something
they pilot</a>. I’ve gotten better at experiencing my body as me since I
asked that (though I’m still not perfect at it by any means), but the
thing that’s increasingly hard is experiencing my brain as me.</p>
<p>This sounds bad, maybe it is. It’s not that I think my brain is
anyone else. All of the bits I have ready access to feel like they’re
doing fine, but it feels like there’s so much going on that I don’t have
access to, and it’s very frustrating.</p>
<p>I can’t tell how much this is just me and how much is just the human
condition. Sometimes when I don’t understand something fundamental like
this it’s because I’m missing something that other people get, but I
think a lot of the time other people are also confused about it when
it’s pointed out them and just ignore it most of the time.</p>
<p>But it feels like there’s clearly a lot going on under the surface.
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-09-10:00.html">My
relationship with memory is very confusing</a> and there’s clearly a lot
going on there that I don’t have direct access to.</p>
<p>It’s not totally clear to me whether I should <em>expect</em> to be
able to directly access these things. All of it feels a bit mysterious.
It may well be like feelings, where you have to essentially use
something else to “bridge” the parts of your brain that aren’t talking
to each other directly.</p>
<p>One thing that sometimes works as bridging is some sort of talk aloud
protocol. Writing is, in theory, similar but I think doesn’t work as
well. Hearing yourself speak and noticing what comes out is often a
surprisingly good means of finding out things about yourself. If only it
didn’t feel so weird to do.</p>
<p>I’ve been experimenting a little bit, on and off, with <a href="https://photographyinsider.info/image-streaming-for-photographers/">image
streaming</a> as a way to learn visualisation. I’ve had precisely zero
success with this method, precisely because speaking out loud seems to
be hard for me in a way that disrupts the process. I’ve had a little
more progress with doing the things they say don’t work, just paying
attention to vague visual impressions I have while half asleep in
bed.</p>
<p>My working theory about visualisation is that it’s basically a user
interface to some sort of underlying capability, and I’m definitely not
completely lacking that underlying capability, but it feels like I’m
communicating with it in semaphore. e.g. I’ve got a pretty good spatial
memory, and there’s definitely <em>something</em> I can do that is like
mentally walking around in a place that I have lived for a while. Or
even just spent a reasonable amount of time. There’s even a bit of a
somatic component to it - I have an experience as if walking around in
the place. I could no more really tell you what I’m doing than I could
tell you how I left my hand up. I just do it.</p>
<p>Similarly, I’m obviously not walking around in the space. It’s more
like the equivalent of an inner monologue - there’s no confusing it for
sound, and yet it has a sound like quality. This is what I assume (and
have somewhat confirmed) visualisation is like for most people too.</p>
<p>But there’s clearly still some of the things that visualisation is
supposed to access going on. I can, e.g. describe what someone looks
like from memory. It just doesn’t go via an imagine appearing in my
head. <em>Something</em> is providing the information, in whatever form,
I just don’t have access to it as anything other than a black box
feeding me information.</p>
<p>In general, all the capabilities of my mind feel fragmented. Like
there are different pieces talking to each other, but large chunks fail
to participate in any sort of unitary whole. This isn’t plurality - I
don’t feel like multiple people occupying the same space - it’s more
like I’m a person with a computer, and some of the capabilities of the
human-person computer reside in the computer which the person has to
type commands into.</p>
<p>This sounds dramatic, but I’m pretty sure some degree of this is
normal. Being human is weird, and the more you look at it the weirder it
gets, so most people don’t look at it.</p>
<p>Which is fine. It’s mostly unproblematic as long as everything is
working.</p>
<p>But often not everything is working. When tired, or ill, or
half-asleep, capabilities stop working or become slow to respond. It
feels like it’s unsurprising that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html">I
sometimes panic at night</a> - the capabilities I rely on to function as
me are disrupted, and the fragmented nature of thought starts
showing.</p>
