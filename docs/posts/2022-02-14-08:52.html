<h1 id="fewer-than-100-thoughts-on-jokes">Fewer than 100 thoughts on
“Jokes”</h1>
<p>This month is supposed to be reading month, and I’m not doing a very
good job on reading new books, so I’ve been revisiting some old books
instead. Unfortunately in order to get what I want out of this, I find
myself in the position of having to do something that is anathema to my
very nature: Taking notes on the books I read.</p>
<p>I’m rubbish at private writing, so I’m going to experiment with
formats for doing that on here. How useful they’ll be to anyone else, I
don’t know. Feel free to skip these.</p>
<p>Today’s format experiment is that I’m going to try to write down 100
thoughts on Ted Cohen’s book “Jokes: Philosophical thoughts on joking
matters”. I’ll first do a linear scan through the book jotting down
anything that I think of as I write it or exerpting any particularly
insightful quotes, then I’ll start sampling at random, and once that
stops working I’ll try to synthesize thoughts from further up the
list.</p>
<p>100 may be ambitious (it’s more than one thought per page in the
book) but let’s see how it goes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Page x (in the acknowledgements before the formal numbering). “James
Lorie reminds us of the ster standard according to which no joke without
obscenity is really a joke, and that a really fine joke is fit for any
company”. What is the actual relationship between obscenity and humour?
Very few of the jokes in this book are actually obscene - a few are
tasteless, but very few contain actual obscenities (even the jokes about
sex are mostly PG!). There is clearly something distinctive about
obscene humour, but obscenity seems inessential. It’s possible I’m
reading this line too literally.</li>
<li>Also page x. “Nicholas Rudall is […] one of those rare companions
with whom one can work on a joke”. This seems like an interesting
experience that I mostly lack. I was wondering about the art of joke
making, but maybe I should be focusing on the art of collaboration on a
joke.</li>
<li>Page 1. “The fact of jokes - the fact that there are such tings - is
something of note, something worth thinking about.”</li>
<li>Page 3 “Many jokes are usefully thought of as solutions to problems
that have been set” - notably though, they’re problems with absurd
solutions. A joke that will come up later is “What do Winnie the Pooh
and Alexander the Great have in common?”. This is a central example of
such a problem-based joke, but the reason it is a joke is that it is
designed to break you out of the normal logic that you would use to
address such a question. A joke that is a problem is a joke that is
designed to remind you that your normal tools do not exhaust the set of
tools you may need. (They have the same middle name)</li>
<li>(Paraphrased from page 4). It is an essential feature of jokes that
they rely on your prior knowledge - a joke that has to explain the
background knowledge in order to get the joke will fail to land.</li>
<li>One of the background pieces of knowledge you can assume when
telling jokes is that the listener is familiar with jokes. As such, you
can tell jokes that are funny partly because of their relationship to
the nature of telling jokes. For example “How many surrealists does it
take to change a lightbulb? Fish.” is not a funny joke unless you are
familiar with the category of problem-solving jokes.</li>
<li>Page 10. “there will be no comprehensive theory of jokes or their
purpose, not only because I have no such theory but also because I
believe there could be no such theory.” - this is the core of what makes
“Jokes” an interesting but somewhat limited book I think. It’s mostly
Cohen giving a tour of some things he finds interesting in the space of
jokes, but it could use a bit more theory to tie it all together. I
often struggle to remember what I get out of this book because of the
lack of unification</li>
<li>I also think he’s wrong about the impossibility of such a theory.
His argument seems to be that joking is too contextual to admit a
unifying theory, but I’m not sure this follows - eating is also very
contextual, but there are unifying principles underlying our appetites
and what makes a dish work. One shouldn’t confuse the highly contextual
nature of expertise for a lack of unity in the underlying problems being
solved.</li>
<li>Page 11. You can tell this is a book about philosoph of humour
because it contains the following joke: “According to Freud, what comes
between fear and sex? fünf”. All books about philosophy of humour have
to contain this joke, it’s the rules.</li>
<li>Cohen claims that this joke doesn’t really work written, but I don’t
have a problem reading it. I wonder if this varies based on how people
read and whether they hear the words in their head as they read?</li>
<li>Back to page 10. Cohen talks about joking as a two-stage art,
consisting of both composition and telling. I have <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-14-12:00.html">a
whole prior post</a> disagreeing with this.</li>
<li>(Page 12). There is no such thing as a pure joke. All jokes are
conditional on what the audience understands - at the bare minimum you
have to share a language (though this is perhaps only true in Cohen’s
specific conception of “joke” - it seems to me that some physical humour
could be universal. Although even there you have to share a body
language, which isn’t as cross cultural as all that), but really a joke
can only land if it fits in with and askew to the audience’s
understanding of the world. See <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-04-12:52.html">The
humour test for expertise</a></li>
<li>Cohen uses the term “hermetic” for a joke that requires extensive
background knowledge or beliefs (e.g. a mathematician joke)</li>
<li>Page 17. “It is not required that the audience (or the teller)
actually <em>believe</em> that [the stereotype on which a joke was
predicated], but he must be acquainted with this idea. When jokes play
upon commonplaces - which may or may not be believed - they oten do it
by exaggeration.”</li>
<li>Page 20. “It is difficult to say just when such jokes [about
particular regional or ethnic stereotypes] become offensive.” - one
thing that often comes through in this book is that Cohen seems to have
a very high tolerance for jokes that would definitely get you cancelled
these days. It seems partly a very 20th century attitude, but also
partly particular to Cohen. This isn’t just that he’s fine with them for
other groups either - he talks about antisemitic jokes in the same way
that he talks about Polish or black jokes (though, it does seem to me
that his examples of antisemitic jokes are milder than his examples of
racist jokes against black people. Though also in his defence, he mostly
uses the latter as examples of jokes that go too far)</li>
<li>(Page 21). “Conditional jokes that depend upon feelings in the
audience, likes and dislikes, and preferences, I call affective.
Typically, these jokes are understood by many people, but the success of
the jokes—their capacity to amuse—depends upon the affective disposition
of the audience.”</li>
<li>(Page 22). Jokes can have many layers of response. A joke can be
funny to most people, but also have affective or hermetic conditions
which render it funnier.</li>
<li>(Page 24). An example of this that he mentions and that I hadn’t
realised before is that when Hamlet says “Get thee to a nunnery”, this
line lands very differently if you know that “nunnery” is slang for
“brothel”.</li>
<li>(Page 25). Cohen talks about the futility of trying to explain a
joke, but I’m not so sure. There’s definitely an art to explaining a
joke so that it’s funny, it’s just funny for very different reasons than
the joke would otherwise be funny. It’s more like a sort of Stewart Lee
“domming the audience into laughing”. It’s also very annoying, but it
does work.</li>
<li>(Page 25). “a deep satisfactionin successful joke transactions is
the sense held mutually by teller and hearer that they are joined in
feeling”. This is a recurring theme in the book - that jokes are a form
of shared intimacy, based on the fact that you both find the same things
funny. Cohen doesn’t explicitly link this to any theory of humour, but I
think part of the significance here is that a shared joke indicates that
you and I find the same things incongruous, and thus that we must look
at the world in a broadly similar way. Sharing a laugh is revelling in
some way that we are the same.</li>
<li>(Page 28). Cohen talks about communities of amusement, and I don’t
think he’s right. He’s committing a classic mistake that likeness and
relationships are enough to constitute a community. People who share an
amusement with you are like you, and like each other, but lack a
sufficient unity as a group to constitute a community. It’s more like a
type than a community, and types can serve as the starting poitn for a
community but are not one themselves.</li>
<li>(Page 31). “Why do we recommend these things to one another, anyway?
[…] Because we wish one another well? Well, maybe, but at its core I do
not think this is entirely a matter of altruism. […] I discover
something of what it is to be a human being by finding this thing in me,
and then having it echoed in you, another human being. […] I want you to
like it beause I like you and I want you to have something you like, and
I want you to be grateful to me for supplying it. But I also need you to
like it, because in your liking I receive a confirmation of my own
liking.”</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, I did not make it to 100. This got me about a third
of the way through the book, and took me about an hour, and I think
that’s enough for now.</p>
<p>I didn’t find these useless to write, but I also don’t think this is
the right format. I’ll probably try something more essay-like next
time.</p>
