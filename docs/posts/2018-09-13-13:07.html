 This is a fairly involved example which I don't expect to convince anyone,
and is just the result of me thinking through such things.</p>
<p>
 Suppose we have a bunch of propositions \(A_1, \ldots, A_n\).
We know a priori that \(A_i \not\implies A_j\) for \(i &gt; j\),
but do not know whether there are any forwards implications.
We have an "implication oracle" which acts as follows:</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  It has access to a number of "primitive implications" of the form \(A_i \implies A_j\).
   These implications are considered to be unreliable: They are true with probability \(1 - \epsilon\),
   but with probability \(\epsilon\) they provide no information (i.e. the proposition may be true, we just don't know that).
   These errors are independent.</li>
 <li>
  We may query the proof oracle with any pair \(A_i, A_j\) and it tells us the probability of there being a valid proof of \(A_i \implies A_j\) given only a true set of primitive implications.</li></ol>
<p>
 We also have a "plausibility oracle" that gives us our prior probabilities of \(p_i = A_i\) being true.</p>
<p>
 Suppose we want to define an agent that chooses between these propositions, with a reward if the proposition chosen is true.</p>
<p>
 We can define a Bayesian agent that picks whichever of \(k \in \{i, j\}\) has the highest posterior probability\((1 - \epsilon) P(A_k | A_i \implies A_j + \epsilon p_i\).</p>
<p>
 The problem with this agent is that it is not transitive!</p>
<p>
 Consider the following example: Let \(\epsilon = 0.11\),
and suppose we have the primitive implications \(A_1 \implies A_2\), \(A_2 \implies A_3\) and the prior probabilities \(p_1 = 0.2\), \(p_2 = p_3 = 0.01\).</p>
<p>
 This results in the above agent preferring \(A_2\) to \(A_1\), \(A_3\) to \(A_2\) and \(A_1\) to \(A_3\).
The reason is that the strength of the implication \(A_1 \implies A_3\) is weaker than that of either the individual implications, as it is \(1 - (1 - \epsilon)^2 \approx 0.21\).
Thus even though we still "believe" this implication, the weaker strength of it makes our prior probabilities overwhelm it.</p>
<p>
 Now, this paradox goes away if we have access to the inner workings of the implication oracle:
If we know all of the primitive implications a priori then we can just calculate the "true" posterior probabilities across all possible combinations of whether the implications are valid or not,
and pick the answer with the highest posterior.</p>
<p>
 But this effectively requires us to know the entire space of propositions in advance.</p>
<p>
 So the question is, does there exist a decision procedure that has the following property:</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  It depends only on the output of our two oracles.</li>
 <li>
  It is transitive.</li>
 <li>
  It weakly dominates the above oracle.</li></ol>
<p>
 My suspicion is that the answer is no, but I'm not sure how one would go about proving that.</p>
