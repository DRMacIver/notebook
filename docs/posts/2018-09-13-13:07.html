<p>This is a fairly involved example which I don’t expect to convince
anyone, and is just the result of me thinking through some things.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a bunch of propositions <span class="math inline">\(A_1, \ldots, A_n\)</span>. We know a priori that
<span class="math inline">\(A_i \implies A_j\)</span> is false for <span class="math inline">\(i &gt; j\)</span>, but do not know whether there
are any forwards implications. We have an “implication oracle” which
acts as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It has access to a number of “primitive implications” of the form
<span class="math inline">\(A_i \implies A_j\)</span>. These
implications are considered to be unreliable: They are true with
probability <span class="math inline">\(1 - \epsilon\)</span>, but with
probability <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> they provide
no information (i.e. the proposition may be true, we just don’t know
that). These errors are independent.</li>
<li>We may query the proof oracle with any pair <span class="math inline">\(A_i, A_j\)</span> and it tells us the probability
of there being a valid proof of <span class="math inline">\(A_i \implies
A_j\)</span> given only a true set of primitive implications.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also have a “plausibility oracle” that gives us our prior
probabilities of <span class="math inline">\(p_i = A_i\)</span> being
true.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to define an agent that chooses between these
propositions, with a reward if the proposition chosen is true.</p>
<p>We can define a Bayesian agent that picks whichever of <span class="math inline">\(k \in \{i, j\}\)</span> has the highest posterior
probability<span class="math inline">\((1 - \epsilon) P(A_k | A_i
\implies A_j) + \epsilon p_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>The problem with this agent is that it is not transitive!</p>
<p>Consider the following example: Let <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon = 0.11\)</span>, and suppose we have the
primitive implications <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \implies
A_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_2 \implies A_3\)</span> and
the prior probabilities <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = 0.2\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(p_2 = p_3 = 0.01\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some boring computation that I can’t be bothered to carry over to
text results in the above agent preferring <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_3\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A_3\)</span>. The reason is that the strength of
the implication <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \implies A_3\)</span> is
weaker than that of either the individual implications, as it is <span class="math inline">\(1 - (1 - \epsilon)^2 \approx 0.21\)</span>. Thus
even though we still “believe” this implication, the weaker strength of
it makes our prior probabilities overwhelm it.</p>
<p>Now, this paradox goes away if we have access to the inner workings
of the implication oracle: If we know all of the primitive implications
a priori then we can just calculate the “true” posterior probabilities
across all possible combinations of whether the implications are valid
or not, and pick the answer with the highest posterior, but this
effectively requires us to know the entire space of propositions in
advance.</p>
<p>I think that <em>no</em> strategy which has to decide based only on
the answer of those two oracles on the current pair can dominate this
strategy, because this is the dominant strategy for the case where there
are only two propositions and the oracles are exactly correct about the
probabilities, but I haven’t checked the details of this argument.</p>
<p>So what this means in practice is that if some elements of your
reasoning are “screened off” from you as black boxes, and you do not
have full knowledge in advance of the set of available options, even a
fully VNM-rational Bayesian reasoner will necessarily exhibit
intransitive preferences.</p>
<p>However! Note that <em>this does not mean that they can be Dutch
Booked</em>. The reason for this is that the proper Bayesian reasoner
will update their posteriors about propositions as they are forced to
make choices. This may in fact mean that the time varying preferences
they make are actually transitive, at least in the limit, while their
instantaneous preferences are not.</p>
