<p>Please note: This will contain some spoilers for the entire Wheel of
Time series of books and up to the end of Season 3 for the show.</p>
<p>Some of my earliest memories of reading Proper Fiction are of the
Wheel of Time books by Robert Jordan.</p>
<p>I’m not going to claim they’re great literature. I’m not even going
to claim they’re <em>good</em> literature. I’ve tried rereading them as
an adult and just couldn’t. But as a kid they were definitely doing
something for me, above and beyond their key virtue of being long and
available in airports.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I grew up in Saudi Arabia but came to England multiple
times per year, so my childhood involved a lot of flights.</span></p>
<p>As a result, I’ve read these books a <em>lot</em> over the years.
Certainly every book up to around… let’s say book 8 I think, I’ve read
multiple times. The Fires of Heaven, book 5, I believe I have read no
fewer than four times, but that was because it was the only book I had
with me in a very unpleasant situation, so I read it cover to cover
several times back to back as a form of very literal escapism. I don’t
think I’ve done that with any other book before or since.</p>
<p>Also, notably, I couldn’t tell you a single thing about what happened
in The Fires of Heaven. I was going to say that this was because it was
one of the books where nothing happened, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fires_of_Heaven">looking it up
on Wikipedia</a> I’m not sure that’s true. A bunch of quite notable
things happen in it. Probably the real reason why I don’t remember it
very well is because I read it in 1993 and that was, allegedly, quite
some time ago.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I’m actually a little confused by this chronology
because I don’t see how the events in question could have occurred in
1993, and 1994 seems much more plausible, but I was reading a hardcover
copy of The Fires of Heaven for the first time, which was presumably
around when it came out in 1993. But maybe this was the lag of books
making it over to the UK back when the delays were longer or
something.</span></p>
<p>I feel like this series was a sufficiently big part of my childhood
that I should have more memories tied up in it, but I don’t really.
Fragments of conversations about it with friends and family as kids come
to mind (including several about how weird Robert Jordan was about
girls), and an early realisation about differences in visualisation
ability from talking to a childhood friend about our respective attempts
to recreate the flame and the void exercise.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I never did manage to figure out how to channel
though.</span></p>
<p>Anyway, I was pretty excited about the TV show, though I tried to
temper that down to cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>My emotions since have been… mixed.</p>
<p>They’ve made a bunch of changes to the books and I think that this is
mostly good. I’m a little irked by some of them - for example, I think
giving Perrin a wife only to fridge her in the first episode in order to
give him a more tragic backstory was extremely Not On. I also felt like
they worked a bit too hard on giving Mat a tragic backstory. And I’m not
sold on the new backstory for Nynaeve either.</p>
<p>In general, it feels like… they didn’t like how protagonisty Rand
was, and they felt the need to make everyone else have more protagonist
energy in order to make the whole show more of an ensemble show than it
would naturally be (which matches how the books are later, but early on
Rand is definitely The Protagonist), and I’m not sure that really
improved things.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I think it especially didn’t improve things for Nynaeve,
who is incredibly well cast and didn’t really need the extra support.</span></p>
<p>This also shows up in the whole “we don’t know which one of them is
the dragon” thing. I thought it was an interesting conceit, but also it
didn’t work. I particularly think that “We don’t know if the dragon will
be a man or a woman” part really is too big a departure from the books
and ruins a lot of the worldbuilding such as e.g. the role of the Red
Ajah. Some of this is an attempt to update the gender politics of the
books to be less… Robert Jordan… and I generally approve of that, but I
think there’s a tricky balance to be struck there.</p>
<p>You could see the discomfort with Rand as protagonist play out
particularly badly in the end of Season 2 where they basically felt the
need to give everyone a participation trophy. The big battle scene at
Falme was… incredibly weak, and lacked any of the drama of the books.
Frankly, I hated the ending of Season 2, and that’s part of why I took
so long to start on Season 3. I’d given them a pass for Season 1 ending
so badly, which was apparently mostly due to COVID, but Season 2 was
them writing a season ending without those problems and the result was…
extremely mediocre.</p>
<p>I think one thing this emphasised for me is that I do have a nagging
feeling that the showrunners don’t really understand what was good about
Robert Jordan’s writing. That’s understandable. I don’t really
understand what was good about Robert Jordan’s writing, and I used to
consider myself a big fan, but I think the contrast with the show has
actually helped me understand that.</p>
<p>And I think one thing that Robert Jordan <em>was</em> very good at
was endings. Many or most of his books have big dramatic endings that
have both major plot impact and a real sense of grandeur to them. The
season endings so far… didn’t. The season 3 ending is much better than 1
or 2, but even that it feels like it was a bit lacking.</p>
<p>Anyway, Season 3 makes some pretty dramatic changes from the books,
partly in that it mostly follows book 4 and skips book 3 (presumably to
incorporate it more into season 3), and I think that’s great. I’m
actually a huge fan of most of the changes.</p>
<p>One of the big things that I feel like we’re starting to see is that
they’re pruning plotlines. For example, there’s an entire plotline with
Siuan Sanche post-stilling that got um… quite aggressively pruned, and I
think the series is stronger for it. I think ditching the Choedan Kal
(the giant sa’angreal) is a great choice.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And not just because I think Callandor deserves
better.</span>
This is I think really good, because one of the big problems Robert
Jordan had as a writer was that he was absolutely incapable of doing
that. Every plotline spawned two more plotlines, and a lot of why the
books turned glacial as he wrote more and more of them was that there
was too much going on for each book.</p>
<p>I’m not so sure about the change to Nynaeve overcoming her block this
early on,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">In the books, that’s book 7.</span> but mostly because of the degree it
required Leandrin to be holding the idiot ball to set it up.</p>
<p>Another change I’m cautiously a fan of is the Aviendha/Elayne
relationship. I actually quite like that one of my formative series as a
kid had… actually reasonably healthy depictions of poly relationships,
even if they were much more along the lines of a very heterosexual
polygamous / harem fantasy,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Though often reverse harem too! I don’t think it’s
literally canon that the green ajah and their warders were often in
relationships, but even if they weren’t literally having sex it’s very
much a poly life partnership.</span> and I like that that’s
potentially better balanced out in the series.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Although I’m a little concerned that they’re just going
to pair people up and Rand will only end up with one of them. Certainly
it seems like Mat and Min are getting paired up. Rand, Aviendha, and
Elayne, seems like a plausible triad though given the Aiel traditions.</span></p>
<p>Anyway, Season 3 has definitely restored me to my cautious optimism.
I still don’t think that this series is <em>great</em>, but it’s
starting to manage to be a meaningful improvement on the source
material, which is how I felt it might turn out at the beginning of
Season 1 and didn’t really feel throughout most of Season 2. As a
result, I find myself actually looking forward to Season 4.</p>
