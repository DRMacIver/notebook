<p>I get ill a lot.</p>
<p>Why? Who knows. It’s always happened to me. There are any number of
theories. Maybe I have a weird immune system. Maybe I touch my face a
lot. Maybe I’m a bit too stressed and not breathing properly as a result
and that makes me notice mild illnesses more. Maybe it’s a consequence
of bad diet.</p>
<p>It is almost certain not monocausal and is because of a number of
independent things that don’t actually interact but each just up my
chances of getting ill, because getting ill is a highly nondeterministic
process that is an accumulation of many different things.</p>
<p>Anyway, you know that big 20th century crime wave? Due to social
breakdown, modernity, changing demographics, toxic masculinity
responding to the different gender roles in an increasingly feminist
world, the consequences of multiple wars, globalisation, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis">oops
never mind it was probably just lead</a>.</p>
<p>While we’re on the subject of toxic masculinity, you know how every
woman has experiences of being cat called in public by men?</p>
<p>No, that’s not true actually. It’s definitely the <em>majority</em>
experience, but there are multiple women I know who have cautiously said
to me “It’s really weird. This just doesn’t happen to me. Other women
talk about how this is some ubiquitous thing and I’ve just never seen
it”. It’s not an attractiveness thing - the women I’ve heard this from
are mostly very attractive.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that cat calling isn’t a problem. It’s a problem,
of course, a major one. But somehow it’s one that some women don’t
experience, and it’s fairly mysterious as to why. It’s easy to generate
hypotheses, but it’s hard to say which of them are accurate because it’s
<em>extremely</em> unlikely that it’s monocausal, and if it is
monocausal it’s probably caused by something completely random like
preferred colour palette or getting enough sleep or something.</p>
<p>Seemingly almost everyone in London is tired. Seemingly almost
everyone in tech has a sleeping disorder. Why? Who knows. It’s probably
not monocausal, and if it is it’s probably something random like the
design of the tube network or homophily along shared social traits of
people who sleep badly.</p>
<p>Rival Voices has this idea of <a href="https://twitter.com/nosilverv/status/1205082282979184640">secret
handshake theory</a> as implicit ways of groups signalling
compatibility, and secret handshakes control what parts of the world you
have access to, but I think this if anything <em>understates</em> how
weirdly specific our lived experiences are, and how many areas of life
are opened to or locked away from us by seemingly inconsequential
choices and behaviours.</p>
<p>We like the idea that the world makes sense and things happen to us
for reasons, but this greatly underestimates its complexity, and the
number of things that are indirect consequences of seemingly unrelated
things that just change the numbers enough to completely shift our lived
experience into a different pattern from other people.</p>
<p>Because we focus on this idea that the world makes sense, we tend to
fit our experiences to simple narratives, and this causes us to assume
they are much more shared than they are. We talk about the typical mind
fallacy, but the typical lived experience fallacy is if anything more
pervasive. Your lived experience is probably less universally shared
than you think it is, and where it’s shared it’s probably not for the
reasons you think it is.</p>
<p>Questions like this are frustrating because they’re in some sense
purely empirical and <em>should</em> be answerable by empirical and
logical means, but you’re probably never going to know the answer until
the nature of the world shifts and the problem fixes itself and becomes
obvious in retrospect.</p>
