<p>This is an idea that has been bumping around in my head for a while and I've never quite got around to trying,
but I still think it's a good idea.</p>
<p>A common problem is this: I want to write, but I don't know what to write about.</p>
<p>A possible solution to this is as follows: Make up a fictional character, and have a conversation with them about something.</p>
<p>Even if you don't do anything with this, it's still useful writing practice, but I suspect it will also result in things that might be usefully edited into a long form piece.</p>
<p>Possible prompts within that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain some problem you're having to the fictional person.</li>
<li>The fictional person doesn't understand something and wants your advice on it.</li>
</ol>
