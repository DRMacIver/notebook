<p>I’ve been reading “On Caring” by Milton Mayeroff today. It’s a mostly
pretty good book, outlining a theory about what it means to care for
something, but it has an example quite early on which set me off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obligations that derive from devotion are a constituent element in
caring, and I do not experience them as forced on me or as necessary
evils; there is a convergence between what I feel I am supposed to do
and what I want to do. The father who goes for the doctor in the middle
of the night for his sick child does not experience this as a burden; he
is simply caring for the child.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that this example is obviously made up, and I think that you
can partly tell that because of the straightforward lack of detail, but
I just think it’s also not true.</p>
<p>If your child is currently in desperate need and on the way to ER
then sure, obviously, you’re not going to experience this as burdensome,
because your mind is focused on the immediate emergency, but that’s not
even particularly because it’s your child. In the middle of an emergency
I mostly find that I’m too focused on the actual crisis at hand to think
about how burdened I am by it, although I might have a moment of
thinking “Oh, what a pain” right at the beginning.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And, in real emergencies, have.</span></p>
<p>In contrast if your child is up with, say, a stomach bug, and has
been vomiting, and you’ve just got off a long shift and you’re exhausted
and want nothing more than to go to sleep, then <em>obviously</em>
you’re going to experienced this as burdensome. You’re exhausted, the
whole thing is a pain, and you want to go to bed. You (hopefully) do it
anyway, because its your child and you love them and you <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html">do
things because you gotta</a>. But that doesn’t mean you will never
experience it as burdensome, only that you bear that burden mostly
willingly, albeit sometimes begrudgingly.</p>
<p>And I think that the idea that this devotion and caring in the
context of a child means that you don’t experience any burdens just
completely fails to capture the very normal experience of parenting. And
I think that if you were to look at many actual concrete examples of day
to day parenting you would find that parents experience those children
as burdens fairly often. And typically they will regard those burdens as
worth it, because they want what’s best for their child, but that
doesn’t mean that they never experienced these “oh gosh, my life would
be so much easier if I didn’t have to deal with this shit.” Most
importantly, having these sorts of thoughts <em>doesn’t mean they don’t
care about their child</em>.</p>
<p>And this is a big part of why I care quite a lot about this example
and its basic failure to capture the essential humanity of real
situations. If you’re in a parenting situation like this, where you’re
exhausted and have to deal with a minor medical crisis or other such
problem with your child, there is definitely going to be some part of
you that goes like “oh god. Yet another fucking thing.” And, when it
does, another part of you, which looks at that part and goes, “Gosh. You
must be a bad parent for feeling that way.”</p>
<p>And this seems to me to be what happens when you start with these
tidy narratives, theories of how things should be rather than looking at
specific concrete examples of things as they actually are. You try to
understand your experiences through that lens, and you fall short
because you fail to be the perfectly spherical human in a vacuum that
the theory predicts.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you talk to other parents about their
experiences, pretty inevitably what will happen is they’ll tell you that
yeah of course they feel like that sometimes too.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I can’t find a single biographical detail about
Mayeroff, so I don’t know if he had kids. If he did, maybe he had an
unusually saintly degree of equanimity. But I doubt it. I think he just
had a theory and made up an example to fit it without thinking about
whether it was true.</span></p>
<p>If you instead listen to things as they actually are, as told by
people who actually been through the experiences, what you’ll find is
that there is a richness and a messiness to them that doesn’t conform to
sort of very tidy theories that say how things should work. And I think
this is key to personal growth, to self forgiveness, to navigating the
world in a humane manner, and being kind to both yourself and others.
You have to encounter humanity in all its messy complexity, rather than
humanity as you would like to idealise it.</p>
<p>In a smaller context, I’ve been sort of developing this theme
recently because I’ve been writing a bunch of really mundane blog posts.
These are things like <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-23-21:48.html">here’s
how I clean my kitchen</a>, or <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-13-14:46.html">I had
to cook something on short notice in 45 minutes</a>, or even just <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-14-21:32.html">here’s
some stuff I learned playing Slay the Spire</a>.</p>
<p>Each of these starts from a very concrete experience, talking about
how I navigated it and what I’ve learned in doing so. It’s not purely a
narrative about a specific thing - it sort of tries to point out where
I’ve used some idea that I think generalizes or some oddly useful
principle, but it is still fundamentally the story of that particular
event.</p>
<p>I think these pieces are in many ways much more useful because they
are forced to grapple with the concrete reality of the task at hand. So
they contain a lot of details and how those details were dealt with that
would not have been present if I had started from some much more general
theory. I do then tend to write a little bit about generalisable lessons
from them of course, but I think starting from a real and detail-rich
experience and trying to figure out how to transfer it to other similar
situations gets you a lot further than trying to start from a tidy
theory and forcing your life into its procrustean view of the world.</p>
