<h1 id="masculinity-as-a-source-of-sexual-hang-ups">Masculinity as a
source of sexual hang ups</h1>
<p>I’ve decided I might start writing a second post on days where I feel
like it and have otherwise managed to be productive, and had a
relatively good day doing actual PhD writing today so here we are.</p>
<p>Card Draw: <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/wqn.htm">Queen of
Wands</a>.</p>
<p>Of the actions, this prompted me to think about “Attractive” and
“Self-Assured”, which lead me to think of Mark Manson’s book “<a href="https://amzn.to/2xhqh7O">Models</a>”, which is about how to use
self-confidence (the good kind) to become more attractive and successful
in dating (It’s a much better book than it might sound, but importantly
this is the <em>revised</em> edition. The original edition is apparently
a much worse and more overtly pick up artist book).</p>
<p>From page 225:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The larger problem is not being completely comfortable with your
sexuality and having sex. It’s once again a vulnerability issue. This
problem reaches much deeper and lurks within our subconscious. The most
obvious solution is to simply have as much sex as possible. Getting a
steady girlfriend is the best way to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First thought: Oh god why are so many of the randomisations forcing
me to write incredibly uncomfortable and vulnerable pieces?</p>
<p>He’s talking about sexual dysfunction (“not being able to get it
up”), but I think the idea of “not being completely comfortable with
your sexuality and having sex” is actually a very normal experience for
men. Frankly I think the least plausible part of this entire paragraph
is the idea that there’s a statistically relevant audience of men who
<em>are</em> comfortable with their sexuality.</p>
<p>We have this idea of male sexuality as being something that is fairly
straightforward, but I don’t think that’s true. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-19-10:52.html">Masculininity
training fucks you up</a> and gives you a whole pile of hangups. Given
how heavily our scripts for masculinity center on sex, a lot of those
hangups are going to be about sex.</p>
<p>On the theme of attractiveness, I think this ties into a problem that
I have previously written about, which is that it is often very hard for
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">men
to conceive of themself as physically attractive</a>. Sex is an
opportunity to feel, temporarily, like you are an actual object of
desire, in a way that we do not, generally, allow men an opportunity to
experience.</p>
<p>However, I think by far the more common reason men have such
emotional difficulties around sex is not around desire, but around
shame, which is heavily tied into the masculine experience of sex.</p>
<p>Men are supposed to be hypersexual, ready for sex at the drop of a
hat, always up for it, and any deviation from that is a failure at being
a man. Sex is that which validates your masculinity, so a failure to
live up to this ideal of hypersexuality is a failure to be a man,
failure to be a man is punished aggressively, and it’s hard not to <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">internalise
those punishments</a> as shame.</p>
<p>In Brene Brown’s “<a href="https://amzn.to/2zsY3aG">Daring
Greatly</a>” (p. 102) she talks about male experiences of self-worth and
sex. Quoting a young man from one of her group interviews:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we’re really thinking is “Do you love me? Do you care about me?
Do you want me? Am I important to you? Am I good enough?” That’s what
we’re thinking. When it comes to sex, it feels like our life is on the
line.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From another man in the group:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s true. When you want to be with us… in that way… it makes us
feel more worthy. We standa a little taller. Believe in ourselves more.
I don’t know why, but it’s true. And I’ve been married since I was
eighteen. It still feels that way with my wife.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A therapist who had spent more than twenty-five years working with
men] explained that from the time boys are eight to ten years old, they
learn that initiate sex is their responsibility and that sexual
rejection soon becomes the hallmark of masculine shame. He explained,
“Even in my own life, when my wife isn’t interested, I still have to
battle feelings of shame. It doesn’t matter if I intellectually
understand why she’s not in the mood. I’m vulnerable and it’s very
difficult.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of how this plays out in practice results in bad behaviour from
men - if you feel shame when sexually rejected, it’s easy to react in
entitled ways (or, frankly, ways that are actually fine but read as
entitled when taken against that broader backdrop) - so I don’t
necessarily expect a great deal of sympathy for men here, but if you can
I’d like you to suspend that for now.</p>
<p>One important thing to distinguish here is that men can experience
this negative emotional response even without believing they are
entitled to sex. This is very much a case where aliefs matter more than
beliefs, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">aliefs
are hard to change</a>. If you’ve had it drummed into you that sexual
rejection is a cause for shame, you will feel that shame no matter how
much you have internalised healthy norms around consent. Being rejected
can be a completely valid thing to do that you will respect to the hilt
and still be a source of shame.</p>
<p>A result of this is that there is a lot of identity and emotion bound
up in sex for men - in having it, and also being good at it. Failure at
this is a trigger for shame, and so there is a significant internal
pressure to “succeed” at sex. And pressure is a great way to engage the
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html">brakes</a>,
so it’s no wonder that a lot of men have performance anxiety, and that
this leads to a failure to perform.</p>
<p>(I feel the urge to comment on whether this applies to me personally
and I’m going to resist that urge. Assume whatever you like.)</p>
<p>One of the reasons that it’s important to talk about all of this is
that failure to live up to the stereotypes of masculine sexuality is
actually very common, so when we fail to conform to them through
perfectly normal individual variation we feel shame over that. This is
then compounded when sexual partners, who have heard those same scripts,
react badly to our failure to follow them - e.g. because they perceive
it as a failure of desire on our part.</p>
<p>This is a key feature in which Mark Manson’s advice is
<em>really</em> bad. Just getting yourself a girlfriend (or other sexual
partner) is not a sufficient solution to the problem of working on your
sexual hangups. Getting a steady partner <em>is</em> very helpful for
getting more comfortable with your sexuality, but it’s not sufficient
and may cause major problems if your partner has bought too much into
the standard male sexual scripts.</p>
<p>It is <em>very</em> important, for people of any gender, that if you
want to become comfortable with your sexuality you do so with a partner
who is supportive of you, and with whom <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html">your
relationship is a growth one</a>. Trying to get over your discomfort
with sex with a partner who is going to be pushy and judgmental in their
reactions to your sexuality (especially to any failure to perform it
“properly”) will almost inevitably make things much worse.</p>
