<p>I’ve been trying to learn to win streak in Slay the Spire recently.
That is, get several wins back to back. I’m only playing on Ascension 1
for this, although I am trying to kill the heart (if you don’t know what
this means: Challenging but not the hardest mode).</p>
<p>I’m pretty good at Slay the Spire. I’m not the best, not even close,
but I can semi-regularly beat it on the hardest mode, which is a
reasonably difficult achievement.</p>
<p>But I think one of the things this experiment is very much
demosntrating to me is that I’m playing it wrong. I’m very much engaged
in what you might call “vibe play”<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Get your mind out of the gutter.</span>, where I’ve got a pretty
well honed intuition as to how to play it, and mostly follow that with a
little bit of tactical reasoning layered on top.</p>
<p>This doesn’t produce many win streaks. I think on good days I win
maybe… 5-10% of my ascension 20 games, and probably somewhere in 40%
region for ascension 1. This is good for generating lots of wins, but
very bad for win streaking. At 40%, you’ll get some two-streaks,
occasionally three-streaks, and very rarely four-streaks.</p>
<p>This is, I think, an intrinsic limitation on vibe play, and if I want
to actually win streak I need to start doing some sort of deliberate
play. The problem in slay the spire is that it’s very easy to learn ways
of playing that work very well if the game hands you gimmes. e.g. I
think everyone can beat the heart on A20 most of the time when they get
dead branch/corruption, but you don’t get that very often. If that
happens in, say, 1% of games, you can pretty easily vibe-play your way
to an appreciable win rate.</p>
<p>A more general example, one that I think I’m prone to, is that it’s
very easy to take too many risks in Act 1, which will let you either get
very strong early on or die early on. This pretty rapidly gets you up to
a decent win rate where you win a substantial fraction of the time that
you don’t die in Act 1.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is definitely a little bit my problem, although I’m
more likely to die in Act 2 than Act 1 because Act 2 is the hard act.</span>, but you have a high loss rate in
Act 1, and trying to fix that ends up actually lowering your win rate
because you’re not strong.</p>
<p>One of the things I’m trying to point to in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html">Necessity
Creates Possibility</a> is that it’s very easy to end up in this
situation in real life too. It’s very easy to write when you’re in the
mood to write. That gets your win % on writing up to an appreciable
amount above zero. But if you don’t learn to write when you don’t feel
like writing, you end up very limited in how far you can improve.</p>
<p>The problem with moving off vibe play is that part of how you learn
vibe play is that it’s fun.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Stop snickering.</span> Learning to step outside
that requires taking a more deliberate perspective on the game. I’ve
talked before about <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/record-yourself">recording
yourself playing</a> to do this, but at this point I’m probably better
off actually breaking out pencil and paper and sketching out things
like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What’s my goal?</li>
<li>What do I need to have achieved by floor X?</li>
<li>What probability do I assign to clearing this act?</li>
</ol>
<p>And having a very slow methodical approach to the problem, where I
actually think about what I’m doing.</p>
<p>Sounds boring TBH.</p>
<p>I think this is often a problem you get: You can succeed on pure
talent and enjoyment as long as things are going your way, but in order
to get really good you have to become reliable, and in order to do that
you have to figure out how to succeed even when the world isn’t
cooperating with you.</p>
