<p>There’s a general phenomenon that I think of as “capacities” - your
ability to do things.</p>
<p>A capacity can be anything. It can be a broad skill, it can be a
narrow trick that you know how to solve some particular problem with. It
can be a physical item. It can be someone you know who you can do the
thing for you. It can be some complex emergent combination of all of
these thigns.</p>
<p>A capacity is not just that you can or can’t do the thing. It’s
<em>how</em> you do the thing, and a crucial part is how easy it is for
you to do the thing.</p>
<p>A good illustration of this for me is cars. I’ve owned a car, for the
first time in my life, for a bit over a year. Previously, whenever I
needed a car I rented one.</p>
<p>From a financial perspective, I’d probably still have spent less
money on my car if every time I used it over the last year I rented a
car instead. We’re getting to a point where it might be close, but I
think I’d still have spent about 50% less money.</p>
<p>In actual fact I’d have spent a lot less than that of course, because
most of the times I’ve used the car over that year I just wouldn’t have
bothered. It’s not just about the financial cost, it’s about the fact
that my car is literally right there and I can just get in and drive.
Renting a car adds a significant effort overhead that makes small
transactions not worth it.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Yes, I’m aware of Zipcar and the like. In my experience
they’re exactly optimised for use cases I don’t have, and end up
strictly worse for almost anything I care about.</span> In theory, owning the
car doesn’t make me able to do anything that renting a car wouldn’t, but
in practice the different effort levels involved make it a very
qualitatively different capacity.</p>
<p>Also, as well as the cost and convenience, having the ability to
casually drive means I get better at driving because I do it more
regularly. This makes driving less stressful, so I’m more willing to do
it. Having the capacity teaches you to use the capacity, and thereby
enlarges it.</p>
<p>I did know this prior to owning a car, but I probably still
undervalued it. The main thing I bought a car for was to be able to
drive to and from my parents’ house - it’s about an hour’s drive from me
by car, and essentially has no public transport options to get there in
under three hours.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">In actual fact, I would probably still just about be
ahead on cost if I’d taken a taxi to and from my parents’ every time
I’ve visited them since buying this car. It would come to maybe £200 for
the round trip, and I’ve probably visited them maybe 20 times since
then, which is only £4,000. But also many of the trips would not have
happened at this price tag - it’s easy to pop around for dinner on a
whim with a car, but that wouldn’t happen with a £200 price tag and the
need for advance planning that comes with a taxi.</span> It was very much a response to a
particular problem I had.</p>
<p>But once you have a car, you can just use it for easy things. I use
it for shopping from time to time, I use it for moving big things. I can
bring a giant stack of firewood back from my parents’ place if I want,
which a taxi would side eye me on. I can pop over to the next town
easily.</p>
<p>I probably still underutilise the car to be honest. Part of this is
that I feel at some level I shouldn’t be driving too much (I think this
is true but that I’m probably overstating it). Part of this is just that
I’m still used to a mindset that I’ve had for most of my life, where I
don’t own a car and can’t do car things as a result.</p>
<p>This seems like something I should fix. The car is useful, and
expensive to maintain, so I might as well figure out how to make use of
it.</p>
<p>This is a much more <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/why-is-it-hard-to-choose-what-to">proactive
mode</a> than I often remember to deploy. I’m all about “That does seem
like a problem. Have you tried solving it?” but this is much more “That
does seem like a solution. Have you tried finding problems to solve with
it?”. It’s worth doing, I just don’t habitually do that.</p>
<p>Importantly: I don’t know that I could have done it nearly so well
without owning a car and starting to recontextualise how useful they
are. Once you have the capacity and you figure out how to use it well,
you unlock a lot of hidden value that just thinking in terms of what
problems you already have that could be solved with it, because it
doesn’t just solve existing problems for you, it opens up things that
you don’t even think of as problems because it doesn’t occur to you that
you can do them.</p>
<p>Part of why I’ve been thinking about this recently is that my income
has gone up a lot over the last year, and money is very much a capacity,
and I’ve been trying to figure out ways to deploy that capacity for life
improvement recently. It’s going pretty well. There are fairly modest
low hanging fruits available that you just don’t think about when money
is tight, and aren’t even that expensive once it’s loosened up a bit.
For example I paid for an ironing service recently, because I like
wearing collared shirts<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Although I haven’t actually started wearing them again
yet. Lost the habit and I’ve been busy.</span> but hate ironing. It cost about £20
to get literally every shirt I own ironed. Not free by any means, but
very affordable.</p>
<p>Another capacity I’ve been working on that flows out of this recently
is that I realised that my household would very much benefit from some
additional help with admin, so we’ve hired a part-time PA<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">How did I find a PA? I posted on the local Facebook
group asking if anyone was available for such work. Another thing I
recently discovered existed, and thereby developed a capacity I
previously lacked.</span> on
an experimental basis. We’ll basically give her odd jobs and pay her
weekly at a rate of £15/hour for however much work she’s done during
that week. This is an <em>extremely</em> early days experiment, so there
are loads of things that may or may not work about it, but I’m very
happy to have done it nevertheless.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about this decision is that I don’t
really know what sort of tasks we’ll give her. The specific prompt was I
wanted someone to offload a search for a good cleaner to, but that’s
totally something I could do myself<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">And has been totally something I could do myself for
months…</span>. We’ve got a bunch of
other small tasks like that, but there’s a very real possibility that
we’ll just work through a TODO list and then by done.</p>
<p>But I don’t think so. I think having someone like this to offload
tasks to is going to be a really good capacity to have, and I’m looking
forward to finding out ways to use it.</p>
