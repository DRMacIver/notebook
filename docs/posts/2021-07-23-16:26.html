<p>One of my common pieces of advice is that when doing something or
making something, you should separate your planning into two distinct
goals:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How good do you need the thing to be?</li>
<li>How good would you like the thing to be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Your first priority is to come up with a plan that all but guarantees
that the thing you make will be as good as you need it to be. For
example, when giving a talk, you don’t <em>need</em> a lot. If your talk
is coherent, vaguely interesting, and doesn’t run over time, you’ve
succeeded. You’ve given a talk that is good enough, well done.</p>
<p>Once you’ve ensured that, you can stop feeling anxious about it,
because you’ve removed any uncertainty about whether you will succeed.
You will succeed, it’s just up for you to tinker with the details. You
can make it better for as long as it’s worth making it better, and when
it’s not worth it any more you can just stop there and declare your
planning done.</p>
<p>Generally I find you actually produce better results by doing it this
way, because removing the anxiety reliably improves performance.</p>
<p>You don’t have to though. One nice thing about this approach is that
you get very good at making sure something is good enough without having
to put much effort on it. Then, when you have times where you really
don’t feel like putting in a lot of effort, you can massively phone it
in, and that’s fine too.</p>
