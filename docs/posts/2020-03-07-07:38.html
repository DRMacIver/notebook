<p>Definitions are gauche, but I’m going to attempt a definition of
“nerd”.</p>
<p>Prompts:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1234959895486660609">Me
getting mad on the internet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am utterly baffled by the question “What are some things you love
that aren’t nerd-related?”</p>
<p>What do you mean things that are not nerd related? Everything is nerd
related. Nerd is a way to relate to a subject, not a property of the
subject.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another prompt is the recent run of <a href="https://www.egscomics.com/comic/party-126">El Goonish Shive</a>
where this is a topic of conversation (yes I read EGS, no I’m not
embarrassed about this. It’s fun. Shush).</p>
<p>Anyway, the definition I would like to propose is this: Nerding is
being interested in a subject for intrinsic reasons, rather than for
anything that that subject can bring you. It’s a way of engaging with
the subject where if someone asks you why you’re spending so much time
on it, any answer you give other than “Because it’s
<em>interesting</em>” would be a rationalisation.</p>
<p>I’m going to use <em>grounding</em> as the antonym for nerding - that
is, engaging with a subject as interesting for <em>extrinsic</em>
reasons. Grounding is what you do when you want to get shit done with
the subject. The strategy I outlined in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/08/how-did-you-get-started-so-quickly/">how
to quickly become effective</a> is a grounding strategy - you don’t
avoid learning about the subject, but your learning is very much
directed towards a specific goal, and the subject is secondary.</p>
<p>(I’m not at all happy with “grounding” as a term and reserve the
right to replace it with something better later)</p>
<p>My interest in cooking is grounding, because it’s primarily driven by
a need to eat and a desire to eat tasty things. My interest in voting
systems is about 90% nerding, because although I occasionally use it in
practical ways it’s primarily driven by the fact that voting systems are
intrinsically interesting to me.</p>
<p>As a result, the distinguishing feature of nerding about a subject is
that you know far more about it than is reasonable for what you
need.</p>
<p>Virtually everyone nerds at least a bit. Unless you are fundamentally
incurious about the world, you’re going to find out stuff just because
you find it interesting. In the same way that you can write without
being a writer, you can nerd without being a nerd. Nerds are just those
of us with a strong tendency to nerd, and for whom that is an important
part of our identity.</p>
<p>People think of some subjects as nerdier than others, and it’s
probably true that some subjects are intrinsically more suitable for
nerding about, but people nerd about all sorts of things. I’m nerding
about communication and emotional processing skills at the moment. I
have a friend who is a dedicated sex nerd. Sports nerds are everywhere.
The best bartenders I know are drinks nerds. Chefs are
<em>certainly</em> food nerds. It’s <em>really</em> hard to find
subjects that nobody nerds about.</p>
<p>Nerding often arises after grounding. You pick up a subject because
you need it for stuff, and then you find some aspect of it
<em>fascinating</em> and you’re just kinda hooked. Again, voting theory
was this for me - I got interested because of the UK referendum on
electoral reform. Test-case reduction is another one. Actually
<em>most</em> of my nerding arises this way.</p>
<p>The thing about being a nerd about a subject is that it often unlocks
levels of practical functional capability that are useful to everyone,
even when they’re grounding. Because you spend so much time thinking
about it, your personal (or social) ecosystem of thoughts and ideas
around the material is so much richer than that of someone who is just
functionally interested in it. It means that when you have a concrete
problem to deal with, you have a whole set of tools that are ready to
hand that you can apply to it that nobody who wasn’t intrinsically
interested in the subject would have bothered to acquire. This means
that nerding is often a necessary step to making real, practical,
progress.</p>
<p>(Of course, someone whose interest in a subject is 100% nerding will
often go off in a weird useless direction that has no practical
applications. That’s fine too, but progress requires a certain mix of
grounding and nerding).</p>
<p>Because of this I often do what I call <em>nerd raiding</em> - when I
have a subject where my interest in it is mostly grounding, I still go
seek out the subject nerds so that I can steal their good ideas, because
often there’s enough material in there that they arrived at the hard way
that I can just package up and use without doing the same level of
work.</p>
