<p>This was a good book, and is going on my rereadings shelf. I've already recommended it to several people before I finished it. I have maybe a few more caveats after having finished it, but I still think it was a helpful read.</p>
<p>The book is what happens when a professional philosopher discovers that she is terminally ill and decides to do philosophy to it.
What results is an exploration of the <em>phenomenology</em> of being ill - the subjective and social experience of it.
She does not deny that there is an objective physical component to illness of course,
but explores how understanding illness on a purely objective, physical, level in many ways misses the point and that the subjective experience of the patient should be be considered.</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what to do with the information from this book yet.
I tried to summarise it in this review, and my summaries kept coming out as quite uncharitable,
so I'm going to leave it at this: I liked the book and found it a useful perspective, but I'm not sure it's a perspective I'm able to or want to adopt.
I disagree significantly with several of the arguments presented, but think they are probably still quite useful mental frameworks to adopt in some circumstances.</p>
