<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CartesianDaemon">Jack</a> posted a link
to <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2018/09/21/dungeons-and-dragons-one-three-britons-are-neutral/">this
YouGov poll</a> in which people were asked their D&amp;D alignment and
somehow almost nobody thought they were evil. I’m as surprised as you
are given the last two years of British politics.</p>
<p>The particular thing that <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1043075395237625858">was
surprising to him</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What the everloving fuck? I love the idea of mapping political
positions this way, but you reckon “everyone is a bit racist” and “i
like theresa may” are… lawful good? How about lawful evil? I think
well-meaning fussy philosophical types vote libdem, not ukip.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paladins are literally cops, Jack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, uh, yeah. ALGCAP (All Lawful Good Characters Are Bastards).</p>
<p>I have technically played a lawful good paladin. My interpretation of
him probably veered more chaotic good than was strictly accurate.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1007533080750551040">an
earlier discussion</a> with some other people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I <em>have</em> played a paladin and it worked pretty well. He was
very good at smiting people with sarcasm (and then a sword). I think I
just decided that traditional interpretations of lawful good as being
humourless were too narrow and decided to have fun with the concept
After all, nothing incompatible about a deep burning righteous anger at
the injustice of the world and a profound desire to fuck with
people.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Shit, maybe I <em>am</em> the lawful good character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(For the record, I am not the lawful good character. I’m very clearly
Chaotic Good. Maybe Neutral Good on days when I’m too lazy to be
properly chaotic).</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1046703352522985472">Jack and
I later discussed</a> another aspect of the villain versus hero
dynamic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Every time I find myself going “hmm the villain actually has a
pretty good point it’s a shame they’re evil” I start to head canon that
I’m consuming media from the “plucky ragtag heroes’” well funded
propaganda arm.</p>
<p>Jack: What I eventually realised was that villains’ motivations
ranged from “bizarre” to “excellent” but if what made them villains was
doing unjustifiably bad things in the pursuit of that.</p>
<p>Me: I think that is broadly true, but that it is remarkably
convenient how the people with excellent motivations for changing the
system always do unjustifiably bad things in the pursuit of that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Avatar: The Legend of Korra” is possibly the worst example of this I
have ever seen: I broadly enjoyed the show, but <em>every single
villain</em> was raising legitimate objections to the system, but
fortunately they were evil so you could just punch them and move on
without addressing the fundamental systemic inequalities that they were
objecting to.</p>
<p>As I put it elsewhere in that thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gotta love them underdogs and their defence of the status quo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recommended reading/viewing on this subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spiderlight by Adrain Tchaikovsky is an excellent deconstruction of
D&amp;D alignment systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA">Twisted: The
Untold Story of a Royal Vizier</a> is <em>so</em> good. I keep wanting
to write a new version of Rules of Wishing based on a Twisted set of
characters rather than the original movie’s.</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, that’s why <del>I am</del> SOMEBODY ELSE WHO IS NOT ME IS
raising an army of crows.</p>
