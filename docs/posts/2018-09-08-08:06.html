<p>I’ve been trying to come up with a definition of mathematics that I
like and think would be useful in the course of teaching people
mathematics.</p>
<p>This is of course a big ask, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_mathematics">according
to Wikipedia there is a great deal of spirited philosophical debate on
the subject</a>, but on the other hand I think most of those definitions
are <em>terrible</em>, so I don’t feel too bad about trying myself.</p>
<p>The one I dislike the least from that list is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mathematics.html">Eric
Weisstein’s</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is a broad-ranging field of study in which the properties
and interactions of idealized objects are examined.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a bit long-winded but mostly captures the sense I want. The
phrasing I’ve been thinking of in preference is something more like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is the rigorous study of hypothetical objects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that in mathematics we’re not really concerned with real
life physical objects, we can just say “Suppose there were objects
satisfying the following properties, what can we reliably say about
them?”</p>
<p>Sometimes those objects are ones that can easily be realised as real
physical objects. For example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_chess_problem">Mathematics
of Chess</a> studies hypothetical chess boards, but those hypothetical
chess boards can easily be realised by going out and buying an actual
physical chessboard. However, many of them can not be. There is no way
to construct a real physical set of natural numbers, but from a
mathematical point of view that’s OK - we can reason about the
properties of the hypothetical one perfectly well.</p>
<p>There are a couple axes of variation on which people differ about the
nature of mathematics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is informal mathematics legitimate, or should all mathematics be
considered a (possibly bad) approximation to an entirely formal set of
reasoning rules?</li>
<li>Are some hypothetical objects privileged as the true platonic
mathematical objects in a way that others are not?</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this definition is more or less compatible with any
combination of answers to these questions: Formalism is a question of
what we count as “rigorous”, and even if there <em>are</em> platonic
mathematical objects, we still must study them <em>as if</em> they were
hypothetical because by its very nature we cannot have access to the
platonic realm.</p>
<p>Traditionally the answers to these questions have been correlated
more than I think is logically required: The formalist position is that
mathematics doesn’t real and that everything is formal manipulation of
symbols, while the platonist position is that we are seeking to discover
truths about the ideal platonic realm and the truths are what matter
regardless of how we reason about them.</p>
<p>I think there’s room for a third position though, which is that
formalism is interesting but not strictly required, but the objects we
describe have no inherent reality and really are allowed to be purely
hypothetical. I’ve historically self-described as a formalist, but I
think this third position is closer to my true beliefs: I don’t think
Platonism is philosophically defensible, but I do think there is a lot
of interesting mathematical content and activity that cannot be
adequately captured by the formalist position.</p>
<p>In many ways this third position is that of Lakatos in his “Proofs
and Refutations”. Most of the interesting mathematics happens in a fuzzy
middle-ground where you are making your definitions precise enough to be
defensible. This could go all the way to formalism, but it doesn’t have
to.</p>
<p>The mathematics of chess is again an interesting test case here:
Chess is a purely arbitrary set of rules. I think it would be hard to
argue that there is a platonic game of chess that is in some essential
way different than it would have been if, say, kings moved like knights
or you could win by killing the queen <em>or</em> the king. These are
both perfectly valid games that someone could play, and there is a
perfectly valid mathematics in studying them, but we study the
mathematics of chess in preference to them because that is the actual
game people play.</p>
<p>Conversely, there really is a set of true statements about the game
of chess (in an informal sense of chess), and while mechanising and
formalising the study of them might be <em>useful</em> for determining
what they are, I think it’s fair to say that what actually matters is
whether the statement is true of real games of chess, and the
formalisation only matters to the degree that it helps us discover those
truths.</p>
<p>I don’t think the above definition is enough to fully reconstruct an
idea of what mathematics is like, because it leaves open two big
questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>How do we select which hypothetical objects to study?</li>
<li>How do we study them?</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer to the first is comparatively easy, which is that it’s
based on what I think of as “The Three Good Reasons To Do Things”:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s useful.</li>
<li>It’s interesting.</li>
<li>Some asshole is forcing you to do something useless and boring.</li>
</ol>
<p>(Most people’s encounters with mathematics is of type 3, sadly, which
is why I always hear “Oh I <em>hated</em> mathematics at school” when I
tell people I did mathematics at university)</p>
<p>Of course, point 2 is slightly subtle, because doing mathematics is
much easier if other people have done similar mathematics, so you’re
constrained not just by what <em>you</em> think is interesting, but by
what you can convince other people is interesting.</p>
<p>The second question is the hard part, and I think we currently do a
very poor job of explaining it to people. I need to think further about
it.</p>
