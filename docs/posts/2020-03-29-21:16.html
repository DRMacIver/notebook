<p>Previously I have written blog posts about:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/thinking-through-the-implications/">A cat who can open doors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-26-09:48.html">Fixing a shower</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/08/how-did-you-get-started-so-quickly/">How to get started in a new code base</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Except that's not what any of these are about.</p>
<p>They're actually about:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Toolkitized thinking</em> - how to apply things that you've learned in other contexts</li>
<li><em>Pragmatic problem solving</em> - how to let go of the desire to solve the problem properly and just solve the problem</li>
<li><em>Efficient learning</em> - how not to get distracted by <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-22-18:01.html">the impossibly large number of things to learn</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of them are of course about both these things: Something happened, and by looking at what happened you can learn something generalisable about it.</p>
<p>Typically of course, you don't actually see a single thing and get the general insight, you acquire the general insight after seeing many different things, but often a specific example is exactly what you need to <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/">explain the point</a>, possibly to someone else, possibly to yourself.</p>
<p>One way of looking at mathematics is that it's about taking a look at an argument and paring it down to its bare essentials and generalising it. Trying to take something hyper specific and turn it into a simple reusable principle that canbe applied, by asking what about the problem actually matters.</p>
<p>Our interactions with the world are like this too. Everything is a teachable moment, all you have to do is look at it through the right lens and use it to teach something.</p>
