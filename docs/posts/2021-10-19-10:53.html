<h1 id="a-simple-model-of-depression-and-depressive-realism">A simple
model of depression and “depressive realism”</h1>
<p>I was talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/fvathynevgl/">Vathy</a>
about depressive realism, and when I expressed skepticism about its
existence they asked me to say more. I did, and it seemed an unusual
enough perspective that I thought I’d quickly write it up in a blog
post.</p>
<p>So here’s what I think, roughly. This is a simplified version of what
I actually think (because what I actually think is a giant tangle of
stuff I haven’t fully figured out), and what I actually think is
probably no more than roughly right, but I still think this is a good
model that is helpful to bear in mind.</p>
<p>Basically it’s this: Humans have all sorts of biases in their
thinking. No matter what anyone tells you, this isn’t bad. Biases are
good, as long as you’re expecting to make mistakes (and, I hate to break
it to you, humans make a lot of mistakes and are going to keep doing
that), because <em>not all mistakes are created equal</em>. If you’re
going to make mistakes, you want to bias in the direction of mistakes
that are safe to make.</p>
<p>(See e.g. <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/02/theres-no-single-error-rate/">There’s
no single error rate</a>).</p>
<p>One of the ways that depression differs from healthy cognition is
that it has a much stronger bias in the direction of inaction than
healthy cognition does. If you see a problem, you can decide to do
something about it or not. A depressed person is much more likely than a
non-depressed person to choose inaction, and as a result is more likely
to believe things that justify that inaction (this latter feature isn’t
specific to depression - a non-depressed person who chooses action is
more likely to believe things that justify that action. Motivated
reasoning is a whole big thing).</p>
<p>As a result, a depressed person is more likely to get the right
answer in situations where the right answer is inaction, and less likely
to get the right answer in situations where the right answer is
action.</p>
<p>In situations where the right answer is typically inaction (which can
happen if you’re in a dangerous environment which you have little
control over, certainly, and as a matter of numbers this is probably
more likely for depressed people) this will tend to mean that depressed
people are more likely to be right than people who are neutral or biased
towards action, but it’s not that the depressed person is more realistic
than the non-depressed person, it’s that their biases are currently well
adapted to their situation, and if the situation changes they would
retain those biases and be less well adapted. I’m no more inclined to
call this realism than I am to call a stopped clock accurate because it
happens to be stopped at the current time.</p>
