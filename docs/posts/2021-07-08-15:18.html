<p>Here’s an interesting therapeutic technique that I’ve synthesized out
of various practices. It’s not exactly a <em>safe</em> practice, but I
do think it’s a useful one. I deployed a bit of it earlier in a coaching
session (after extensive checking in with the client that this was
really what they wanted me to do, including asking “This is going to
require me to be an asshole to you. Are you sure you want me to do
that?”), but I haven’t quite got a handle on how to facilitate it for
someone else yet because I don’t generally do it for other people.</p>
<p>The technique is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Say something that you don’t want to say (or possibly think it
clearly. Saying it out loud is supposed to work better, but I sometimes
find the opposite).</li>
<li>Does it hurt? Good. Identify why it hurts.</li>
<li>Take the part that hurts and say something new based on it. If that
hurts more, switch to that as your new starting point. If not, stick
with the current one.</li>
<li>Keep doing this until you run out of “improvements” or it gets too
much and you need to stop.</li>
<li>Use wherever you’ve ended up as a prompt for introspection. Explain
why it feels so bad, in depth, what you’re worried about, evaluate
whether the statement is actually true, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, such a sequence for me might look like:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I should get a real job.</li>
<li>I’m just kidding myself about being able to make writing work as a
career.</li>
<li>I’m not going to see it through anyway.</li>
<li>I’ll just quit as soon as it gets too difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p>I don’t think this is necessarily true (I sure hope it’s not!), but
there’s definitely some part of me that believes that, and I can notice
a real physical discomfort increasing as I move down the list. I really
don’t like the last entry at all.</p>
<p>This is roughly a shadow work / Focusing hybrid. It’s designed to
help you uncover emotionally painful beliefs that you’re trying to
ignore. Generally these sorts of statements don’t hurt unless some part
of you believes on some level that they are true, and this process gets
you to a point where you have identified a specific acutely painful
belief to interrogate (and ideally do something like coherence therapy
to to defuse it, if indeed that belief is false. See e.g. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">Emotional
reactions as legacy code</a>).</p>
<p>It’s also, I think, probably quite a good tool for learning Focusing
because of how unsubtle it is. This is not staying with a fuzzy unclear
feeling until it makes sense, this is confronting you with exactly what
a felt sense dialled up to 11 is like. It’s oddly similar to the
strategy I outlined in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-06-13:53.html">Start
from amazing</a>, in that it dials up the feelings until they can be
clearly identified so you know what to look for, rather than leaving you
in a fuzzy in between space where you’re not sure if anything is going
on there or not.</p>
