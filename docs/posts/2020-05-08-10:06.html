<p>Here's a trick I figured out yesterday. It solves quite a specific problem that I have, but you might have similar problems, and even if not I think it demonstrates some useful general principles that could be applied in other circumstances.</p>
<p>The problem is this: I buy too many books.</p>
<p>It's not a <em>disaster</em> because I also read a lot of books, but I buy books at a higher rate than I read them, and I often buy books that I later decide that actually I'm not realistically going to read.</p>
<p>The problem is basically that when I encounter an interesting book whose ideas I would like inside my brain, I often impulsively buy it.</p>
<p>Some of this is a problem of impulse control, for sure, and I could definitely fix it by being better at impulse control, but currently I'm trying to be <em>less</em> good at impulse control, so that seems counterproductive.</p>
<p>An additional complication is that the correct amount of books for me to be buying is not zero. I <em>could</em> just blanket ban myself from buying books. I would experience it as unpleasant, but it's manageable, but that would not result in my buying the right number of books.
I <em>do</em> read a lot of books (typically between one and three a week, not counting fiction which are a separate category because I read them as ebooks), and I like having new books around, and I can definitely afford to spend a certain amount of money on books.</p>
<p>The additional complicating factor is that my bookshelves serve as a kind of... thoughts I want to have later? They're a TODO list for reading, and my experience is that I will lose track of digital TODO lists for reading - they will get too large, and I will forget about them and leave them to rot (I am even worse at digital <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html">care work</a> than physical).</p>
<p>So, I:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a constant impulse to buy books, and suppressing it will be unpleasant.</li>
<li>Do actually want to buy a non-zero amount of books.</li>
<li>Need a way to keep track of the books I may want to buy later.</li>
</ol>
<p>Anyway, there's an easy solution, and it's <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html">kinda stupid</a> that it's taken me this long to realise it.</p>
<p>The solution that satisfies all of these is to have:</p>
<ol>
<li>a default Amazon list of books I wanted to buy.</li>
<li>a scheduled task every Sunday to buy a book.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now when I want to impulse buy a book I instead just click the add to list button instead of the buy now button. Then, every Sunday, I go through the list and decide which of these books is the one I want to buy the most right now. In the course of doing so, I remove any books from the list that I'm definitely sure I won't want to buy later.</p>
<p>This solution is actually very good, because it:</p>
<ul>
<li>puts the rate at which I buy things under my conscious control independently of the impulse to buy things (a thing I learned the value of from years with <a href="http://beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a>).</li>
<li>gives a direct and (almost) equally satisfying replacement for the impulse activity by pressing a different and equally accessible button.</li>
<li>fights the digital rot that lists normally have for me by coupling it to a regularly scheduled activity that I <em>want</em> to do because I get rewarded with a book.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition I think it will significantly increase the quality of the books I do buy, because each book I buy will be a measured choice between alternatives where invest some effort in ensuring that my book this week will be a good one. I don't intend to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">avoid all error</a> and I of course <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html">can't ensure I always pick the <em>best</em> one</a>, but I'm pretty sure that investing about twenty minutes of thought into the question will result in me improving on impulse decisions.</p>
