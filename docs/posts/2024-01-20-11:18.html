<p>I am, it will shock you to know, annoyingly finickity about things
being done correctly. It hurts me somewhere deep in my soul when people
do things in obviously suboptimal ways.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Importantly I’m fine with people doing things less well
because it’s easier. What annoys me is when people are obviously failing
<em>by their own standards</em>, getting worse outcomes for a worse
experience of doing the thing.</span></p>
<p>I try to reign this in. I don’t actually like telling people off, so
I’ll often be silently frustrated rather than telling someone about
it.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is a bad idea for anything recurring, because as a
result I sound super annoyed by minor things when I finally break and do
say something about it. I’m not saying I don’t do that, I’m just saying
I do that and I know it’s a bad idea. If you will, an obviously
suboptimal approach that is failing even by my own standards…</span></p>
<p>Let me tell you two instances of this recently and something
interesting I learned from them.</p>
<p>The first is this: We have an instant pot. Its pressure cooking mode
gets used for roughly two categoires of things: Making stock (usually
beef, sometimes chicken), and what you might think of as “normal
cooking” - stews, etc.</p>
<p>Crucially, these take very different times. Stock takes about four
hours, normal cooking takes somewhere between 20 and 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Adjusting the time on an instant pot is very slow. This makes
switching between these two times irritating. Fortunately, the instant
pot has a feature for this: The pressure cooker remembers two previous
times, and you can press the pressure cook button to switch between
them. So you can have it remember a four hour time and a half hour time,
and everything is fine.</p>
<p>At least, everything is fine if people use this feature and don’t set
both timers to four hours, forcing me to do the slow adjustment process
every time I used the normal cooking mode. Very annoying.</p>
<p>I did eventually explain this feature to the others in my house, and
of course neither of them knew about this feature - it’s not like they
would have been maliciously setting the timer wrong, and it’s a pretty
non obvious feature until you know about it, and I only found out about
it relatively recently. Problem solved. But I’d been vaguely annoyed
every time I used the instant pot for the entire several month period
between discovering this feature and telling people about it.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">To be clear I don’t use the instant pot <em>that</em>
often, so we’re talking about maybe 3 or 4 times at most.</span></p>
<p>More on this in a moment, but now let me tell you about another
kitchen irritation: Someone has been stacking the pots wrong. This means
that the cupboard doesn’t close properly because the pot stack is too
tall.</p>
<p>There’s a specific stacking order to the pots. If you get it right,
the pot stack is short enough for everything to work fine. If you get it
wrong, they don’t nest and it’s too tall. Someone had been placing pots
in a non-nesting order, and this was causing problems.</p>
<p>Eventually we were in the kitchen together at the time when the pots
needed stacking, and I showed them how to do it. “Oh, that’s how you
stack them! I had no idea those nested, they look exactly the same size.
That’s been so annoying.”</p>
<p>There are two interesting things about this response:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They were in fact correct, it was slightly non-obvious. The pots are
<em>not</em> exactly the same size, but they do look pretty similar from
the outside, it’s just that one has much thinner metal than the other so
although they look similar in size the slightly smaller one nests easily
in the slightly larger one, because the interior of the slightly larger
one is much larger relative to the slightly smaller one than their
exterior would suggest.</li>
<li>They’d been annoyed by this too, and I hadn’t shown them how to
solve their annoying problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>This recontextualised some things for me.</p>
<p>That instant pot thing? Adjusting the timer to four hours from half
an hour is just as annoying as adjusting the timer from four hours to
half an hour. I shared it as a “this is a thing you do that is annoying
to me and here is how to not do it” but in actual fact it was probably a
thing we <em>both</em> were finding frustrating, and that I could easily
have shared as “Hey you know that annoying thing? I’ve figured out the
solution!”.</p>
<p>The thing about being annoyingly finickity is that because I care
about doing things right, and because I <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-18-10:00.html">debug
everything so reflexively</a> is that “obviously suboptimal ways” is not
actually obvious to others. It’s obvious to me because I’ve <em>figured
it out</em>. Sometimes through careful problem solving and sometimes
because I accidentally pressed the button twice and noticed what
happened when I did.</p>
<p>When I’ve done that, I can share this knowledge.</p>
<p>The silly thing is that I’m actually very good at sharing knowledge a
lot of the time. I have a sort of habitual attitude of teaching when
people ask me for help. e.g. a great habit of mine that you should
definitely steal is that when people can’t find a link and I find it
using search, I give them both the link and also tell them how I found
it. This is a great way of helping people be better at search, which is
a surprisingly deep and hard to learn skill.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">The downside of this habit is that it sounds a bit too
“let me google that for you” if you’re not careful. I usually <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/telegraph-your-moves">telegraph</a>
why I’m doing this quite carefully, and am very explicit that it’s not a
problem if they apologise for not googling for it themselves.</span></p>
<p>Similarly, I’m good at sharing information spontaneously - you’re
reading this on one of my outlets for doing so.</p>
<p>But volunteering information to someone specific, in response to
something that they’re doing wrong, feels different. Like I said, it
feels like telling them off, and I don’t like doing that. It feels bad
for me to do it, and I’m worried about people reacting badly to it. Most
people don’t like unsolicited advice. Not that I expect anything to go
terribly wrong from telling partners about minor things, but it might
hurt their feelings and I don’t actually like doing that.</p>
<p>I do think this fear is somewhat real - a lot of the time people
don’t like being told they’re doing it wrong, and often wrong is
subjective. Sometimes <em>I’m</em> wrong because the suboptimal way is
in fact optimising for some preference I don’t know about. I suspect
it’s exaggerated in my head, but it is a real possibility.</p>
<p>But I think a lot of the time, the fear is largely the result of a
skill issue on my part, and I need to stop thinking in terms of “argh
you’re doing it wrong” and more “boy it looks annoying to do it that
way. Can I show you a thing?” and see how people respond.</p>
