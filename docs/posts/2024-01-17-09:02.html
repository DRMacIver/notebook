<p>Another draft-amnesty post extracting a usable excerpt from an
attempted book length project, though lightly edited from the version in
draft. Originally based on <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1557717189159010304">a
Twitter thread of mine</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>An important tool of ethical reasoning I use is the <em>cheeseburger
threshold</em>: Asking whether an act is ethically better or worse than
eating a cheeseburger.</p>
<p>This is useful because some bad things we do are bad like murder, and
some are bad like eating cheeseburgers, and the standards we hold those
different types of act to should be very different.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is not unlike the classic distinction between a
venial and a mortal sin, but I like making the distinction this way
better, both for the examples and because I’m not that interested in
whether your action counts as turning away from god.</span></p>
<p>The key distinguish factor is that something is murder-bad if the
ethically correct amount to do of it is zero, while it is
cheeseburger-bad if some amount of it is morally permissible and
incremental reductions are morally virtuous even if they don’t - and
aren’t intended to - get you to zero.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">There are of coure strict vegetarians who would hold
that eating a cheeseburger is as bad as murder, but even most
vegetarians who believe that the correct amount of cheeseburgers to eat
is zero will generally treat it as being in a different reference class
to murder.</span></p>
<p>Why cheeseburger-bad?</p>
<p>There are clearly negative consequences to eating a cheeseburger -
the meat industry has many ethical problems, and even the most ethically
produced cheeseburger in which everyone in the pipeline was well paid,
all the animals were well treated, etc. has significant environmental
costs. Probably even if not vegetarian one should assign some ethical
significance to the life of the cows killed in making the cheeseburger
(both for the meat and for the cheese), and that too should be factored
in.</p>
<p>But also cheeseburgers are convenient and delicious and widely
culturally accepted as permissible to eat and so, despite the harms, we
eat cheeseburgers.</p>
<p>Possibly you’re vegetarian, or vegan, or hindu, or keep kosher. In
which case I encourage you to substitute your own similar badness act
for the cheeseburger. I like the cheeseburger example because the harms
are so clear - as much as we like to ignore them - and eating it is so
clearly culturally permitted. But you could consider, for example,
driving a car as another cheeseburger style act (environmental cost,
noise pollution, risk of injury to others, etc).</p>
<p>Another cheeseburger-bad act might be pirating movies or TV shows.
It’s on its own a “victimless” crime if you wouldn’t otherwise have
bought the thing pirated (of course, it’s easy to convince yourself of
that. Would you really not have?). Certainly the harms of pirating a
digital good are relatively minor. And yet, in aggregate, piracy does
seem to cause a lot of harms, especially to independent authors,
publishers, and developers.</p>
<p>I will continue to be using cheeseburgers as my example.</p>
<p>The point is that cheeseburger-bad acts are things that we
acknowledge have harms, and that a maximally virtuous version of
yourself might choose to avoid cheeseburgers entirely. The current
version of you could, and possibly should, also choose to eat fewer
cheeseburgers, and we would acknowledge this as morally virtuous,
without requiring that you cut out on cheeseburgers entirely for it to
count.</p>
<p>In contrast, the ethically correct amount of murder is zero. You do
not get points for saying “Yeah, I know murder is bad, I’m trying to cut
down”. Murder is bad enough that by the time “I’m trying to cut down” is
a consideration, you are already beyond the ethical pale.</p>
<p>Although I’ve phrased it as a threshold for how bad an act is, using
this tool more a question of how (if at all) you can reform from
performing such an act.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I think this may be a sign that I’m framing this wrong
tbh. “Is it as bad as eating a cheeseburger?” is a useful framing
question, but really what I’m talking about is something more like
categories of ethical acts. Commensurability of acts is part of it but
not all of it.</span> A habitual murderer doesn’t need to
cut down, they need to change their very way of being. A habitual
cheeseburger-eater just needs to cut down.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is again a subject on which many vegetarians would
differ because they would in fact regard cheeseburger-eating as
requiring a fundamental reform of your character. I suggest again
replacing this with another example.</span></p>
<p>I think it’s very hard for sufficiently many cheeseburger-bad acts to
add up to murder-bad. Someone who eats cheeseburgers for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner, is rude to everyone he meets, drives loud gas
guzzling cars everywhere, and generally goes out of his way to do every
pettily immoral and inconsiderate act he can think of is still not doing
something murder-bad. The correct approach here is still to cut down,
and every step along the way to doing so is morally praiseworthy.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Although they may be enough of a jerk that you don’t
want to praise them. You can think of this instead as being
incrementally less morally blameworthy.</span></p>
<p>In contrast, say, running a scam is murder-bad despite not being
nearly as bad as murder - you can’t think of reform from this as trying
to cut down on the scams you run, you need to become a person who does
not run scams.</p>
<p>Why make this distinction?</p>
<p>The main reason is because it’s important to be able to acknowledge
that some things we do are bad without it being a big deal. Having a
class of actions which we acknowledge are bad but don’t consider
ourselves morally obliged to eliminate entirely allows us to make
incremental improvements, which has good effects. If we treated all
cheeseburger-bad things as murder-bad, this creates a very strong
incentive against recognising them as bad at all.</p>
<p>The cheeseburger example works very well here: Even from a strict
vegetarian’s point of view, it should be considered preferable for 100%
of people to cut out 90% of their meat consumption than for 50% of
people to go full vegetarian. Also, most people aren’t and are not going
to become vegetarian, and being able to view their actions as worth
reducing without having to</p>
<p>Being able to acknowledge the harms of our own behaviour without
being overwhelmed with guilt allows us to take a proper reflective look
at our own behaviour and, where we decide it’s worth it, improve it, and
where we decide that’s too much work, helps put it in perspective.</p>
