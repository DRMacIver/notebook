<p>I was in a conversation with two other people, let’s call them Alex
and Pat,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Brought to you as the first two members of my standard
quartet of placeholder names: Alex, Pat, Kim, and Charlie. I wanted a
good set of gender neutral names to use when writing Voting by Example
and standardised on these.</span> the other day where Alex and I had
clearly had rather more mental and physical health problems than Pat.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Or, possibly, had just hit the point of actually having
learn to deal with it when they hadn’t. I could very easily have been
Pat 10 years ago and it wasn’t because I lacked problems, I was just
ignoring them</span></p>
<p>Alex and I were sharing tips about how to recognise different types
of low function days and what to do about them. I think we’d just been
talking about the significance of temperature in extremities - cold feet
in particular for me are a strong sign that my low function day will be
improved by something that raises my heart rate. A hot bath is an
excellent choice, jumping jacks are a solid second place.</p>
<p>Pat said something to the tune of “Huh, I’ve never paid this much
attention to my body for debugging bad days”. Alex and I gently pointed
out that this was because they hadn’t had to, and that people with
sufficient problem in this space tended to learn these skills out of
necessity.</p>
<p>Now, the thing is, these skills are actually useful to everyone, and
they’re not that hard to learn if someone is teaching you. But if you’ve
got relatively common and severe problems you both have a much stronger
signal to work with and many more opportunities to practice, making it
much easier to learn on your own. You’ve also got a much more urgent
need to learn them, so you tend to seek out literature on the subject,
have conversations like Alex and I were having, etc. and so naturally
become something of an expert on them.</p>
<p>If you <em>don’t</em> have that particular class of problem though,
you will still have cases where you urgently need the skills. Everyone
has bad days from time to time, everyone goes through bad experiences,
and knowing how to deal with strong emotions and low function and the
like is very useful for those times.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a way of getting that without having to have to
have recurring mental and physical health problems: You can just talk to
and read people who do and pick up skills from them that they find
useful.</p>
<p>I’ve adopted this strategy in the past by reading up on cPTSD. I’m
pretty confident I don’t have cPTSD, but the cPTSD literature is really
useful for understanding trigger management, and I certainly get
triggered. Knowing how to distinguish a Fawn from a Freeze from a Flight
is really useful,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">It’s also useful but less difficult to distinguish these
from a Fight</span> as is the more basic skill of being
able to notice the bare fact that I’m triggered at all.</p>
<p>Another place where I’ve been actively using this strategy recently
is borrowing tactics from people with ADHD. I don’t have ADHD<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Though I have a significant number of friends and
strangers on the internet who randomly email me to tell me to go get my
ADHD diagnosed ASAP who disagree. I think they’re wrong. I have ADHD
tendencies but fall well short of actual ADHD.</span>, but a lot of ADHD problems are
normal problems dialled up to 11, or experiencing normal things as if
they were the worst and most overwhelming version of them.</p>
<p>But… sometimes you do actually get the worst and most overwhelming
version of them, or sometimes you’re exhausted and anxious and so it
also feels like everything you can normally handle is dialled up to 11,
and it sure is useful to have strategies for this case.</p>
<p>One general category of solution for when things get too overwhelming
is <em>externalisation of state</em>. The easiest version oof this for
me is to just talk out loud about what I’m doing. “What am I doing this
morning? I need to finish writing my notebook post… I need to get
everything packed… I should look through all the drawers to make sure
I’ve not missed anything… I’ll do that now actually because it’s really
important and I mustn’t forget it”.</p>
<p>A more extreme version of this which I’ve been deploying at work
recently is extremely detailed TODO lists in a shared slack channel
called drmaciver-todo.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Slack because I’m already always in Slack, so it stays
relevant, and shared because only shared digital objects have object
permance. I don’t know why this is, but for me and many others digital
objects are only real if they’re shared with other people. If only I
have access to them they fade from memory.</span> This involves writing down
everything I have to do today, adding to it as things come up, modifying
it as I work on things, with big green checkmarks when tasks get
completed.</p>
<p>This level of detailed TODO list is very much an ADHD strategy, or at
least a strategy I’ve learned from people with ADHD, but that’s because
right now I have very ADHD shaped problems: There is too much stuff to
fit in my head and it’s resulting in my being constantly distracted and
lost, and I need to externalise my working state. Essentially I’m
building a functioning <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2023-06-20-17:00.html">extended
brain</a>, because my internal brain can’t cope with its task list right
now, and as a result borrowing strategies from people who regularly
can’t cope with their task list is very useful.</p>
<p>This is another reason I like talking to people about their problems:
When I do, I learn about their solutions, and even if I don’t share
their exact problems there’s a very good chance that at some point in
the future I’ll have something similar enough that those solutions might
apply.</p>
