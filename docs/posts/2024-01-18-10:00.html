<p>Loosely based on a stub chapter from the same work as <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-16-13:11.html">Journaling
as a foundational practice</a>.</p>
<p>The core of my approach to a lot of things is embarrassingly simple:
If you’re getting outcomes you don’t like, that means something about
what you’re doing isn’t working, and you can fix that. A system is
perfectly designed to achieve the outcomes it achieves, so if you don’t
like the outcomes you have to change the system.</p>
<p>This is in direct contrast to <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/dont-just-try-harder">doubling
down on the thing you’re doing</a> because if it isn’t working then
clearly the solution is to try harder, or to get mad about the fact that
it doesn’t work and conclude it must be some failure of yours.</p>
<p>I have a running joke that when I do coaching, a great deal of the
value I add is to listen patiently and then say “Yes, that does sound
like a problem. Have you tried solving it?”</p>
<p>I very rarely literally say this, but I do often say variants of
this. “What have you tried?” is a common one. Often the answer is that
they’ve not tried anything. Sometimes they have tried many things, but
they haven’t worked.</p>
<p>“They” of course also often means “me”. Sometimes I need someone to
say “Have you tried solving the problem?” to me too.</p>
<p>My approach to writing software isn’t that much different. I write
software. It’s software, so it has problems. I fix those problems. <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/03/what-the-fuck-are-we-doing/">Sometimes
I probably shouldn’t</a>, but ultimately this approach has produced very
good results that would otherwise seem impossible, just by fixing the
problem in front of me repeatedly and seeing what happens.</p>
<p>Fixing things that aren’t working consists of trying to understand
them, based on that understanding trying to change something that you
think will help, and learning from what happens then - either its
success or its failure.</p>
<p>Ultimately this is a process of <em>debugging</em>, and it feels very
much like debugging software, where you systematically narrow down what
causes a problem until it’s clear enough to fix.</p>
<p>Software and other <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/two-types-of-work">crunchy
work</a> is very good for teaching this skill, because it provides you
with a very tight feedback loop that rewards systematically going
through everything. It’s a good type of work for learning <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-07-08:50.html">how to
be better at everything</a> because of how much it rewards diligence.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">This is interesting contrast to my advice not to just
try harder, but I think they’re compatible. The unified advice is that
if you’re going to put in more work, don’t put it in by doing more of
the thing you’re currently doing, do it on things that you’re not doing
because they seem like too much work.</span> A lot of these skills then transfer
reasonably well to other environments, as long as you’re prepared to
understand how crunchy work and squishy work differ. Nobody likes a
software developer who treats everything like a software problem, but
part of why that type is so common is that the basic attitude
<em>works</em>. Treat things as understandable, and fixable.</p>
<p>For me in particular I use “debugging” as a concept a lot in
emotional contexts. e.g. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-20-17:58.html">How I
fix anxiety triggers</a> is very much a debugging process.</p>
<p>One of the most important things to debug is when you get <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-give-good-advice">advice</a>
from other people and it doesn’t work for you. It might be that you’re
doing it wrong, but it might also be that the advice is not well suited
for you.</p>
<p>I’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1656631345165000704">said
before</a> that the universal disclaimer of self-help books is “This
advice has a domain of applicability, and the author is not competent to
assess what it is”. i.e. This will help some people, but the author
doesn’t actually know who. This applies to all advice, really.</p>
<p>Some (non-exhaustive) ways advice can fail to apply to you:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There is some ideal middle ground, and this advice is designed for
people on the far side of that from you.</li>
<li>This advice relies on capabilities you lack.</li>
<li>This advice solves something that’s not your bottleneck.</li>
</ol>
<p>But from a debugging point of view, this makes such advice actually
quite useful.</p>
<p>There’s a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/1118539273">How
to measure anything</a> that I am mostly<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I think that there is a target audience for whom it is
very good, and I am not that target audience.</span>
indifferent to, but that had a fundamental premise that has entirely
justified the read for me: A measurement is anything that reduces
uncertainty.</p>
<p>In this sense, everything you try while debugging is a measurement.
Either it solves the problem, in which case you’ve solved the problem
and also learned something, or it doesn’t and you’ve learned something
through how it fails. Use that measurement to find out more about the
problem. Everything you try is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-26-09:43.html">a
forking path</a> that tells you something about the system.</p>
<p>So here is my advice: Try more things, take more advice, but notice
as you do when something isn’t working, and then fix that.</p>
