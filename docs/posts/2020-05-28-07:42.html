<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3deDz4N">Thinking in Bets</a> by Annie
Duke, page 10:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hindsight bias is the tendency, after an outcome is known, to see the
outcome as having been inevitable. When we say “I should have known that
would happen,” or, “I should have seen it coming,” we are succumbing to
hindsight bias.</p>
<p>Those beliefs develop from an overly tight connection between
outcomes and decisions. That is typical of how we evaluate our past
decisions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from a chapter called “Life is poker, not chess.”</p>
<p>Before I start, I’d like to say that I think “Thinking in Bets” is a
very good book and I would recommend that most people read it. It is
probably the most accessible practical manual of rationality that I know
of (there may well be better ones, but I don’t know of them), and most
people’s thinking would be improved by a good primer in that.</p>
<p>Which is why I now want to explain why it’s also wrong about
everything.</p>
<p>In discussions on Twitter about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-27-07:21.html">yesterday’s
diatribe against The Inner Game of Tennis</a>, I made <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265765964915904514">the
following point</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem being that because he got his start in tennis where
verbal intelligence mostly <em>does</em> need to get out of the way, and
because most people don’t have tennis-related trauma, his model works
pretty there but has fatal flaws when you try to generalise it off the
court.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gallwey is making a classic error: He is a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">nerd</a>,
and he thinks his special interest is universally applicable. Most of
the advice in the inner game of tennis is very good <em>if you only ever
apply it on the Tennis court</em>.</p>
<p>It’s absolutely a good thing to take ideas from a specific nerddom
and try to generalise them. I love doing that, and claiming that it was
bad would be the rankest hypocrisy on my part. The problem is not
generalising his Tennis related learning off the tennis court, the
problem is that having learned all these skills in a context where they
are useful close to 100% of the time, you do not learn to understand the
preconditions under which those skills are useful.</p>
<p>Annie Duke has made the same mistake: She has learned a skill set
within the context of a game of poker, and is now viewing the relevant
skill set as applicable to life as a whole. Unfortunately, Poker has
some very distinctive features over life:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It is intrinsically adversarial.</li>
<li>It is highly structured.</li>
<li>The probabilities of different outcomes are well defined and easily
calculable.</li>
<li>It has a single well-defined utility function (money made)
describing success in the game.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you may or may not be aware I love to hate on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_expected_utility">Subjective
Expected Utility Theory</a>, but poker is an example where utility
theory is great because you <em>do</em> have a utility function and you
<em>do</em> have probabilities. Regardless of whether you believe in
SEU, life outside poker simply isn’t like that because the probabilities
and the utility function are at best much more complex and less well
defined.</p>
<p>(Note: Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">The Kelly
Criterion</a> the utility function of poker is <em>not</em> just
straight up money made, but its logarithm, but the point still
stands).</p>
<p>Poker is an <em>excellent</em> game with which to hone your skills
for a particular type of technical rationality, but technical
rationality will only take you so far.</p>
<p>C. Thi Nguyen suggests that games are <a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/NGUGAT-2.pdf">ways of experimenting
with different structures of agency</a>. In playing a game, you are
entering a world in which your choices are constrained to follow the
rules of the game, and so you learn to play <em>as if</em> those were
the only choices possible. As a result you will <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html">learn
skills that you are neglecting in other contexts</a> where those
constraints on your agency do not apply. Learning the inner game of
tennis <em>will</em> teach you about embodied cognition, because you
can’t think your way out of the problem. Learning poker <em>will</em>
teach you about technical rationality, because you can’t sweet talk your
way out of the problem. Both embodied cognition and technical
rationality are very good skills that you can apply in life more
broadly, but because life lacks that restricted structure of agency that
the game had. The reason the game taught you that skill so well was
precisely <em>because</em> the skill is not universally applicable.</p>
<p>David Chapman has recently published an <a href="https://meaningness.com/eggplant/introduction">updated
introduction to his Eggplant Book</a>, which is about what he calls
metarationality, that I rather like. In particular:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[People with metarational skills] produce these insights by
investigating the relationship between a system of technical rationality
and its context. The context includes a specific situation in which
rationality is applied, the purposes for which it is used, the social
dynamics of its use, and other rational systems that might also be
brought to bear. This work operates not within a system of technical
rationality, but around, above, and then on the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This applies more broadly than technical rationality: The
foundational skill of life is figuring out what other skills you need to
bring to bear on the situation. You cannot learn that from a game,
because games work precisely by removing the need for that skill. Games
are an excellent way to hone certain skills, but they intrinsically lack
the ability to teach you the fundamental life skill of <em>knowing which
game you are playing</em>.</p>
<p>All of which is a very long winded way of getting around to a very
basic point prompted by the initial quote: Hindsight bias is good,
actually.</p>
<p>Hindsight bias is generally bad in poker where you can have very well
defined strategies and intrinsic quantifiable uncertainty in the
problem, but in life more broadly hindsight bias serves several fairly
important functions. For example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It forces you to look at problems much more carefully than you
otherwise would have, giving you incentives to improve your skills.</li>
<li>It lets you hold people accountable for actions even when they are
individually harmless.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of the first is that when writing it is generally worth
assuming that any misunderstands are your fault. They may often not be -
many people are very bad readers - but by treating them as your fault
anyway your writing skills will generally improve.</p>
<p>An example of the second is something I often use as a moral test
case and requires a bit more of an extended anecdote.</p>
<p>Near my parents’ place there is a more-or-less blind bend in the main
road with a small road that joins on to the main road right after that
bend. It is very poor design.</p>
<p>Almost nobody comes down that small road. I’ve seen someone joining
on to the main road from there maybe two or three times during many
years of driving that road.</p>
<p>It’s entirely viable to take the bend at 60mph if you ignore the side
road. It’s not <em>that</em> sharp a bend. However, the signage wants
you to take it at 25mph in order to account for that
basically-never-used side road.</p>
<p>Now, my question is this: How fast should you take that bend?</p>
<p>From a subjective expected utility point of view, it’s actually
probably fine to take that bend at 60mph. Slowing down at that point in
the drive is quite annoying, and the chances of causing an accident are
extremely low given the low usage of that side road (and it’s not like
an accident is inevitable at 60mph and more than it’s entirely avoidable
at 25mph, you’re just increasing the likelihood and severity). Yes
you’re trading convenience for an increased probability of your own
and/or someone else’s death but of course you are, you’re
<em>driving</em>.</p>
<p>But, if everyone else makes the same calculation, driving in from
that side road is now basically a death sentence.</p>
<p>Subjective Expected Utility calculations often look <em>very</em>
different if you universalise them by assuming that everyone else will
make similar calculations, but SEU calculations are hard enough as it is
without reasoning this way, and there’s an easy kludge to achieve much
the same effect: Hindsight bias.</p>
<p>If we treat low-probability consequences as if we should have seen
them coming, and punish them accordingly, then we change the incentives
to shape individual behaviour away from creating outcomes that were
inevitable in aggregate even if they were low probability in any given
instance.</p>
<p>Is this unfair on the indidual who happens to trigger the low
probablity consequence? Probably. But so is dying because everyone else
was making individually rational calculations that decided a low
probability of your death was an acceptable consequence.</p>
<p>Is hindsight bias always good? No, of course not. You have to figure
out from context whether it is or not. But that skill of figuring it out
from context is not, I’m afraid, something you can learn from a
game.</p>
