<p>For the last day or two I’ve doing something I haven’t done for
years, and it’s making everything so much clearer.</p>
<p>That is to say, I’ve got my glasses on.</p>
<p>They’re not especially good glasses. Or rather they’re very nice
glasses that have the wrong prescription, because I got them in 2019
when I finally had to acknowledge that my vision was decaying and that
ugh fine I should get some glasses. The prescription was <em>barely</em>
enough to matter - a mild astigmatism in my left eye, a little bit of
short sightedness in my right - but it was enough that I was starting to
notice and it seemed worth getting glasses to correct it.</p>
<p>Then I didn’t wear glasses for the next two and a bit years.</p>
<p>I still in some sense don’t “need” glasses. I can function fine
without them. My eyes are even driving standard still. But there’s been
an increasingly noticable amount of eye strain. It’s not that I can’t
read signs at a distance, or look at fine details across the room, it’s
just increasingly obvious that this is hard work. I’ve had a lot of
tired eyes and headaches recently.</p>
<p>I’ve known for literal months that the lack of glasses was causing me
trouble, so I did the obvious thing: I left them sitting exactly where
they were, untouched. I certainly didn’t put them on my face.</p>
<p>I’ve been wearing them for the last couple of days because I’m going
to be driving a car tomorrow and that “driving standard” claim is, while
technically true, not quite the standard I hold myself to when driving a
car. I also don’t drink when I’m going to be driving, not even an amount
under the legal limit.</p>
<p>I really am safe to drive a car at my current level of vision. But…
honestly compels me to admit that I’d certainly be <em>safer</em> if I
had slightly better vision. It’s probably not enough to matter, but
being at the wheel of a deadly weapon certainly puts you in contact with
the reality of the world in a way that is hard for me to ignore. I can
much more easily pretend my refusal to wear glasses isn’t causing me a
headache than I can pretend that it isn’t increasing my chances of
killing people.</p>
<p>This all makes me sound like a very nervous driver. I’m not. I’m
pretty confident of my driving ability, and being nervous behind the
wheel makes me less rather than more safe. So, I drive confidently, but
when <em>not</em> in the car I acknowledge that for all their upsides, a
car has an unpleasantly high statistical murder-suicide rate, and I make
decisions in advance that reduce that rate.</p>
<p>Further, radically changing your vision for the first time when you
get behind the wheel of the aforementioned statistical murder-suicide
machine is, to borrow a technical term, <em>fucking stupid</em>, so I’ve
been wearing my glasses for the last few days to get used to them.</p>
<p>The prescription isn’t quite right, as I mentioned, and so I have
begrudgingly booked an optician appointment for next week, but it’s
still a lot better than without the glasses. It’s not an “<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-09-10:00.html">oh
that’s what a tree looks like</a>” moment - I can see trees just fine
thank you very much - but it’s a “Oh I’m supposed to be able to read
signs at <em>that</em> distance am I?” moment. No doubt after I’ve had
my eyes checked again and got some new glasses (or possibly just new
lenses for these ones if that’s an option) there will be similar
revelations in my future for me to ignore.</p>
<p>I don’t know how good you are at reading subtext, but chances are
good you might have picked up on the subtle hint here and there that I
<em>really</em> don’t want to wear glasses.</p>
<p>I should, perhaps, give you some context. Up until 2010 if I didn’t
have my glasses on I would have to hold a book several inches in front
of my face to read. I probably wouldn’t literally walk into things,
because large blurry objects are still large objects that I can see
coming, but if you were on the other side of the room from me I would be
recognising you from height and colour palette only. Then in 2010 a nice
man fired laser beams at my eyes and I acquired <sub>superpowers</sub>
the ability to see things near-perfectly without further vision
correction. Wait, no, I was right the first time. Superpowers. Compared
to my previous state this definitely felt like superpowers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a decade passed, and during that time I failed to
figure out a way to transcend the frailties of my mortal form, and as a
result my eyes got older and weaker again, and now here I am with a need
to strap an awkward contraption of glass and metal to my face in order
to bring my basic functional capabilities up to human baseline and have
fewer headaches.</p>
<p>My objection is not aesthetic. I look good in glasses. It’s a very
different look, especially given that the last time I regularly war
glasses I had hair, but in many ways I look more like me in glasses than
I do when not wearing glasses. Although, truthfully, that’s maybe part
of the problem - the me I look like is the me of my 20s. Maybe the me of
my mid to late teens even. The me of my preteens and early teens wore
awkward giant dorky glasses, before I started wearing thin frames and
smaller rims, but I spent a long time with my face looking like this and
a lot of it wasn’t particularly good, and I’m not particularly proud of
the version of me that existed back then. I want to reach back and give
him a hug and tell him everything is going to be OK, but I don’t
particularly want to <em>be</em> him.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this is actually my real objection. It might be just
a clever theory. The actual complaints that are coming up are that
glasses feel weird on my face. I’m not used to the weight and the
feeling of htem, and I feel hyperaware of their presence on my nose, and
of the slight reduction in peripheral vision. It’s likely that I’ll just
get used to it, but I don’t especially want to.</p>
<p>Another resentment is definitely that I don’t like aging. Yeah, me
and everyone else, I know. Glasses feel like a particularly cruel
reminder of it though - you know that problem you thought you’d fixed?
Unfortunately, bodies!</p>
<p>I suspect some of this is also just a sort of… resentment at being
forced to make a choice about a tradeoff? I’ve never really had to
choose whether to wear glasses or not before. As a young child, I didn’t
know that seeing things was an option. As a slightly older child, I
could choose between being able to see things and not being able to see
things, so I went with the one that was obviously better. For most of
the last 12 years, I’ve not needed to choose whether to wear glasses or
not, because why would I I didn’t need them?</p>
<p>Now though, I’m caught like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass">Buridan’s ass</a>
between two very similar options, except instead of choosing between two
delicious bales of hay, I get to choose between two slightly crappy
options.</p>
<p>I’m aware that many people are absolutely fine with glasses, and that
I probably will once again become such a person and if not will
eventually find another nice man (or woman, or other) to fire lasers at
my face, but for now please forgive my petty resentments at the
constraints placed upon me by my biology.</p>
