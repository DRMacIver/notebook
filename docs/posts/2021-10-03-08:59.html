<h1 id="notes-on-moral-disorder">Notes on moral disorder</h1>
<p>There’s a problem I keep trying to write about and failing to write a
coherent longer piece on, so here’s some rough notes on it.</p>
<p>Many people have emotional problems that are centrally concerned with
<em>moral emotions</em>. Guilt, shame, pride (in the good sense of
pride). Emotions that are centrally concerned with the question of
whether you are acting or living morally.</p>
<p>The central example of moral disorder is this: Your life is made
substantially worse, on an ongoing basis, by feelings of guilt and
shame, stemming from a fear that your behaviour is bad or that you are a
bad person.</p>
<p>Something that <em>might</em> count as moral disorder is <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia">Acedia-based
burnout</a>, burnout from living out of line with your values. Not
necessarily guilt and shame over your actions, but a lack of pride in
your actions,</p>
<p>Non-examples of moral disorder include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone who has done a thing they feel guilty about, makes
restitution, and stops feeling guilty about it (this is the emotion of
guilt working as intended).</li>
<li>Someone who is a genuinely bad person but doesn’t feel guilty about
or ashamed of that (this is still a problem, but it’s not what I would
think of as moral disorder)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re experiencing moral disorder people will probably tell you
that genuinely bad people don’t feel this way, your therapist might tell
you that it’s an attachment problem, or help you analyse where these
feelings come from, and doubtless you’ll find that they’re part of some
lesson you learned incorrectly or from the wrong people or etc.</p>
<p>But very few people helping you with this problem will consider what
I think is a crucial question here: What if the reason you feel like a
bad person is that you’re a bad person?</p>
<p>It is important to be able to ask this, even if the answer is no,
because you can’t trust the answer “no” unless the answer “yes” is
allowed. If you are not able to acknowledge moral failings if you have
them, you will keep worrying about the possibility because you can’t
just shove feelings of guilt away like that.</p>
<p>Also the answer is probably actually yes, sorry.</p>
<p>I think the most common reason for moral disorder actually
<em>is</em> something like “being a bad person”. Moral disorder will
often not shift in response to therapeutic means, because your emotional
responses are broadly correct: Your actions are ones you consider
morally bad, and you are experiencing the correct emotional response to
that, so attempting to feel fine by persuading yourself that your
actions are fine won’t work because you’re basically just gaslighting
yourself.</p>
<p>Instead I think moral disorder typically comes from one of the
following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An incorrect moral framework. A moral framework that declares
necessary actions to be bad, or makes no allowance for human
limitations, will leave you always feeling guilty because you cannot act
in a way that you judge to be moral.</li>
<li>An incorrect understanding of the relationship between bad action
and being a bad person - there is no option for doing good in the world
that does not sometimes have you doing harm, and the appropriate
response to a harm is to feel guilty and, if possible, make restitution.
Importantly, the amount of guilt should be proportionate to the amount
of badness. If you step on someone’s toe you should say “oops, sorry”
and then mostly forget about it. You don’t need to go full “Oh no I am
the worst I am a worm can you ever forgive me?”</li>
<li>Unhealthy emotional behaviours where you cannot deal with any amount
of guilt, causing you to push it away, causing the level of guilt to
rise until you can’t ignore it, because that’s how emotions work.</li>
</ol>
<p>(In case you’re wondering which of these is me: Yes, all of them at
one point or another)</p>
<p>There are definitely more problems than this, e.g. I haven’t
currently got a good theory for where moral disorder that is an absence
of positive moral emotions come from, or what to do about it.</p>
<p>The solution, I think, is some combination of therapy and ethical
philosophy (especially virtue ethics, which is the good one for this,
and especially not utilitarianism, which is a central example of (1).
Yes I’ve heard your argument about why if you do utilitarianism hard
enough it’s good actually because it becomes one of the moral systems
that actually work. I’d prefer to <em>start</em> with one that actually
works without having to do five dimensional chess to get to the right
answer though) - working with both right action and the emotions that go
along with it.</p>
<p>The details? Ah, well, I’m still working on that.</p>
