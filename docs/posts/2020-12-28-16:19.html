<p>Hillel recently wrote about <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/fd1f0758-ae31-4e83-9138-33721cbd5ce3">cross-branch
testing</a> - comparing implementations of the same API in two different
branches as a form of differential testing to see whether a change
introduced any functional differences. As part of his example he ended
up with what was functionally the following interestingness test:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> is_interesting(x, y, z):</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a>    out <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">for</span> i <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="bu">range</span>(<span class="dv">10</span>):</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-4" tabindex="-1"></a>        out <span class="op">=</span> out <span class="op">*</span> x <span class="op">+</span> <span class="bu">abs</span>(y <span class="op">*</span> z <span class="op">-</span> i <span class="op">**</span> <span class="dv">2</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-5" tabindex="-1"></a>        x, y, z <span class="op">=</span> y <span class="op">+</span> <span class="dv">1</span>, z, x</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-6" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="bu">abs</span>(out) <span class="op">%</span> <span class="dv">100</span> <span class="op">==</span> <span class="dv">9</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>He mentions in the article that this gives nondeterministic results
for Hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Running this gives us an erroneous input:</p>
<p><code>Falsifying example: test_f(a=5, b=6, c=5,)</code></p>
<p>This is nondeterministic: I’ve also gotten <code>(0, 4, 0)</code> and
<code>(-114, -114, -26354)</code> as error cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>(0, 4, 0)</code> is the (probably globally) correct answer of
all of these according to Hypothesis’s reduction logic, but Hypothesis’s
test-case reduction is unable to reliably transform all of the failing
examples to it.</p>
<p>I reacted to this as I always do to such things: “Oh, I wonder if I
can make the test-case reducer better”. But the answer is no, no I
cannot, and the reason is that this test contains what is basically a
hash function (not a very good hash function, but good enough), and as a
result the test cases are pretty much uniformly distributed throughout
the set of test cases - if you generate test cases where the values are
between <code>-10</code> and <code>10</code>, then of the
<code>9261</code> possible test cases, <code>129</code> are interesting,
i.e. about <code>1.4%</code> which is about what you’d expect if the
computation of <code>abs(out) % 100</code> were roughly randomly
distributed.</p>
<p>For such functions we end up with the slightly awkward situation
where:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s not that hard to find test cases (<code>1%</code> isn’t that
infrequent! We can just exhaustively enumerate to find the globally
minimal test case).</li>
<li>It’s hard enough to find test cases that most test-cases are locally
minimal.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for (2) is that if reductions are not any more likely to
be interesting than any other test case (which seems roughly true for
hillel’s example and is true by construction for truly random examples),
if you try <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> reductions you only
expect <span class="math inline">\(0.01 N\)</span> reductions to work.
Suppose for a typical triple of integers we have, say, <code>10</code>
reductions we can perform, and those reductions are no more likely than
chance to work, then <code>90%</code> of interesting test cases are
locally minimal, which means that we’ll typically end the reduction
process within a few steps.</p>
<p>In order to explore this, lets consider the following toy model: Our
space of interesting test cases are triples of integers between
<code>0</code> and <code>10</code>, and we have a local reducer that
makes the following transformations:</p>

<p>(if this doesn’t make sense to you don’t worry about it too much,
it’s just the first local reducer that came to mind for triples of
integers)</p>
<p>Suppose we’re reducing subject to an interesting test where the
maximal value <code>(10, 10, 10)</code> is always interesting and every
other test case is interesting with probability <code>p</code>. What is
the probability that this local reducer finds the globally optimal test
case?</p>
<p>Based on some fairly crude simulations, the local reducer starts
finding the globally optimal test-case more than half the time around
<code>p = 0.93</code>, which has the amusing property that the local
reducer is reliably worse (in expectation) than the reducer that just
always tries <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> and gives up if that doesn’t work
(which finds the globally minimal test case with probability
<code>p</code>). Some equally crude simulation suggests that an approach
that just enumerates the smallest test cases for a while returns at
least as good a result in the same number of calls to the
interestingness test in at least 80% of cases, regardless of the value
of <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if there’s any sort of general lesson to derive here -
most interestingness tests are not quite this adversarial - but I do
feel like there is often something like this going on, where the
reduction problem isn’t that hard despite being in a local minimum, and
I wonder if something loosely inspired by this that estimates the
density of interesting test cases below the current interesting test
case, but I’m not sure if that’s entirely useful.</p>
<p>If one <em>did</em> have some sort of easy way to sample from test
cases that are strictly smaller than the current interesting test case,
it might be worth running that for longer than it would be intuitively
obviously useful as a sort of crude but perhaps surprisingly effective
reducer? It’s certainly more robust to this sort of problem than any
kind of local transformation based reducer would be.</p>
<p>This also suggests that possibly test-case reducers should try a bit
more bounded exploration of the small test cases than they currently do,
but I think this is probably misleading due to the relatively small
number of test cases in this example - for most formats of interest the
number of test cases of size <code>n</code> is exponential in
<code>n</code>, so any amount of enumeration other than trying the
globally minimal test case (which <em>is</em> usually worth doing) is
probably not worth it.</p>
