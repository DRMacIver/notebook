<p>In the same conversation with Dave that lead to us <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">talking about which way people veer to avoid collisions</a> we ended up playing a sort of game.</p>
<p>For context: Dave works in transport. Transport is something we all encounter on a very regular basis, so we all tend to think about it a lot. However, transport is a complex system, so it's <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html">more broken</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-11:43.html">less comprehensible</a> than you might intuitively expect it to be. As a result, most people's opinions on transport are <em>bad</em>.</p>
<p>So, the game: I had to keep coming up with transport opinions I held, and Dave would judge if they were bad opinions.</p>
<p>Eventually we ran out of time or got distracted or something (I forget) and I made it to that point without having any bad opinions. I was quite pleased by this.</p>
<p>Another place I was pleased with myself recently was my performance on the <a href="https://programs.clearerthinking.org/common_misconceptions.html">common misconceptions</a> test. The number of things I got right was only so so (I forget exactly, but I think about 85% right?), but I was almost perfectly calibrated: The ones where my confidence was high were right, the ones where my confidence was low were right in about the proportion they should be.
This was a bit surprising to me, as in the past I have definitely not been that well calibrated on similar things.</p>
<p>I think these both happened for fairly general reasons: Over the last decade, I've gotten much better at not having opinions on things.</p>
<p>This might be surprising to you, as I have a <em>lot</em> of opinions, but it makes sense: I've not gotten better at having fewer opinions, I've gotten better at not having opinions on any given thing unless it makes sense for me to do so.</p>
<p>There's a lot of social pressure against doing this.
We basically use having opinions at eachother as a social bonding activity to make sure that the person we're talking to has the "right" sort of politics, so there's a lot of social pressure against this, but I think it's worth doing if we want our opinions to be truth tracking.</p>
<p>Two useful prompts for recalibrating opinions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it <em>useful</em> for me to have an opinion on this? If not, why do I have one?</li>
<li>If this opinion were wrong, would I be able to tell?</li>
</ol>
<p>If the answer to either of these is no, why are you having an opinion on it? At the very least, you should be less confident in asserting it.</p>
