<p>I’m continuing to study Julia Annas’s book “Intelligent Virtue”, and
exploring the one hour study format. Today I thought I’d go through
Chapter 8, “Living Happily” in detail. I’ve copied out the whole chapter
into this notebook and will be deleting most of it (I think this still
counts as fair use. I hope!). I’ve done a bit of a skim through it but
mostly am writing as I read it, so often I’ll write comments that I’ll
later take back.</p>
<p>Page 119:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The very idea that virtue might have any role in flourishing or
happiness has seemed, for about two hundred years, deeply unlikely.
Philosophers in that period have been among the most robust in insisting
that the whole idea of thinking that virtue could lead to happiness is
absurd. Bentham says of the idea that virtue is sufficient for
happiness, ‘What benefit, in any shape, could be derived from
impregnating the memory with such nonsense? What instruction from a
self-contradictory proposition?” Nietzsche is even more dismissive.
’Such assertions and promises as those of the antique philosophers
concerning the unity of virtue and happiness or the Christian, “But seek
ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things
shall be added unto you” have never been made with total honesty and yet
always without a bad conscience: one has advanced such propositions,
which one very much desires to be true, boldly as to the truth in the
face of appearance.’ This idea, that there is some kind of naive
wish-fulfilment or over-optimism in the claim that the virtuous are
happy, lingers more effectively than actual arguments. Up to this point
I have used the interim term ‘flourishing’ rather than happiness, but
this has not been intended to avoid the issue stated brutally by Bentham
and Nietzsche, and I shall now talk in terms of happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think a lot of this chapter will be spent defending the idea that
happiness is not just simple pleasure and that it’s plausible that
virtue is a necessary component of it. I’m not sure I need that defence,
as I’m already pretty on board with the idea. In <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia">Burnout as
acedia</a> I talk about how burnout often comes precisely because we are
not living our life ethically in the way that we want, because we are
out of line with our values.</p>
<p>More generally I think happiness comes from doing things we feel are
worthwhile, and “What counts as worthwhile?” is a fundamentally ethical
question.</p>
<p>The next couple of paragraphs are spent on justifying the question
that we don’t seem to really know what happiness is, which then leads
into the discussion of eudaimonia, starting Page 120:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is a eudaimonist account? An account of how to live, one in
which happiness, eudaimonia, is central (…) the entry point for ethical
reflections is thinking about how your life is going, thinking that can
only arise in people who already are, or are becoming, adult, and who
are aware that everything in their life is not satisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, more or less, my above view: You need to not just be happy
but <em>happy with your life</em>. To judge it as satisfactory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you step back from the ongoing happenings of your life, and wonder
about how and in what direction it is going. This at once reveals a
fundamental difference between two ways in which you can regard your
life. One perspective is the everyday one, in which you do one thing
after another, one action following another chronologically. You get up,
go to work and so on, one thing after another until eventually it comes
to an end when your life does. This is the linear way of thinking of
your life, and it is important as you get through the day, and in many
other ways. But reflection reveals another way in which your life enters
your thoughts about it. We can call this the structured way of thinking
of your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Long discussion of how we do things for reasons and have goals we
are trying to achieve elided)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reflection thus both triggers and then furthers thinking about how to
achieve the goals I have in the light of the constraints I have (time,
money, energy) and their mutual achievability. (…) What is activated is
not thinking in the abstract about types of goal and how they could fit
together, but thinking about how I can achieve the goals I have in the
life I have. It is thinking about my life and how it is going. It is
practical thinking, thinking about my life and how I should structure
it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Thinking about my life and how I should structure it” seems like an
important concept here. I think in many ways this is the goal of
coaching - it draws you into that thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus the original everyday thinking about the way one thing I do is
for the sake of another thing I do leads seamlessly into thinking about
my life as a whole in a structured way. This is a global way of thinking
about my life: I come to see that I have various goals that I aim at,
and that in the one life I have, and which I am already living, these
goals need to be structured in a unifying way in order for me to achieve
them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Honestly I don’t believe this account. I don’t think most people have
goals, and I don’t think reflection naturally leads you to them. This
may, partly, be because of my own baggage around goals, but I also think
philosophers are very inclined to think in terms of goals.</p>
<p>This focus on goals also reminds me of yesterday’s discussion of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-08-01:23.html">Scurrying</a>.
Treating the thing you are currently doing as the unimportant thing you
are doing to get to the goal.</p>
<p>But this is, ironically, actively the type of thing that virtue
ethics in general and Annas in particular are arguing against:
Thoughtlessly doing the thing, rather than doing it with the right
emotions in your heart about it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is this - the idea of what my life as a whole is aimed at - which
in ancient ethical theories is called the telos or overall goal of
life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I very much reject the idea that life has an overall goal, and <a href="https://meaningness.com/no-special-meaning">defer you to my friend
David Chapman for the question of whether we should be upset about
that</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of us have nothing like this specific grasp of what our lives
are working towards achieving. We have only the vaguest idea of what we
are aiming for in life as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, good.</p>
<p>. This is exactly what eudaimonism holds: we have at best a vague and
possibly muddled idea of what our ‘final end’ is; it is most likely to
be only the indeterminate and in itself unhelpful idea of ‘a good life’
or ‘a life lived well’. This supports, rather than undermines,
eudaimonism, for few of us have a determinate idea of what we are aiming
at in our life as a whole at the start of ethical reflection.</p>
<p>Hmm. No this seems to still be back at the “but we <em>shuold</em>
have such a goal”.</p>
<p>I don’t deny that at any given point we should have
<em>projects</em>, and those should be meaningful, but I think if you’re
aiming at an overall purpose to your life you’re going to make yourself
miserable and also probably fail to achieve it. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-23-15:52.html">Life
is an anytime algorithm</a> - whether your life was a success or failure
should not be determined by the fact whether you achieve some grand
goal, because you can get hit by a bus at any point along the way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we did, we would have no need of ethical reflection or theory; our
aims would already be clear and the only problems we would have would
lie in actually achieving them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What?</p>
<p>If you’ve got a good way to never make a mistake en route to your
goal that needs clarification, I’d love to hear it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What we find in fact is that nearly everyone (every moderately
thoughtful person, in any case) is already living a life in which he or
she is to some degree actively unifying the aims they have by working
out what exactly those aims are and what form they should take.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, this seems false. Most people are just bumbling along. They
probably have <em>immediate</em> goals, but that’s not the same
thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The final end, then, is the indeterminate notion of what I am aiming
at in my life as a whole. And the role of ethical thinking is to get us
to think more determinately about it, to do a better and more
intelligently ordered job of what we are already doing anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm. I agree that the goal of of ethical thinking is to get us to do
a better and more intelligently ordered job of what we were already
doing anyway. I remain very very skeptical of this life goals thing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can we say anything more specific about it? At this point Aristotle
says that everyone agrees on something more determinate that we can say
about it: it is happiness (eudaimonia); (…) Aristotle is bringing
happiness in here merely as the only answer people can give, at the
common-sense level, to the questions about why you are doing what you
are doing, and how you can have all the goals that you have. That is, at
the common-sense level, what is being appealed to is the idea that
happiness always puts a stop to these questions. I may want to be
healthy, to have a career, to have a family, as part of being happy, but
I don’t want to be happy as part of or a means to something further.
It’s just what I want; a terminus to my other goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m pretty suspect of arguments like this. I think they’re wrong in a
slippery way, because anything else you claim as a terminal goal the
arguer just goes “Ah but you want that because it makes you happy”, and
I don’t think this is true. If I love someone, I want them to be happy,
and I don’t want them to be happy because their happiness makes me happy
(it may or may not do so depending on the context and my current mood. I
might be too depressed to be happy right now!), I want them to be happy
because I <em>want them to be happy for their own sake</em>.</p>
<p>Side note: When thinking about this chapter I had a flashback to the
first time I had this argument, which was standing at a bus stop waiting
to go home from school when I was 17. I have no idea how it started, and
I am surprised to learn that I have been arguing the nature of the good
life for 21 years now. I thought this was a more recent phenomenon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This role for happiness is extremely useful in ethical theory. At the
common-sense level people disagree about what is worth aiming for in
life, but all agree that, whether they are going for money-making, fame
and fortune, or serving others, they are all aiming for happiness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No we don’t, I literally just disagreed with you, please don’t assume
consensus you don’t have.</p>
<p>I do think most people are aiming at happiness among other things,
but people seem weirdly reluctant to do things that increase their
happiness (citation: Various conversations on Twitter I can’t be
bothered to dig up right now).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness thus forms the point at which common sense agrees on a
notion which forms the starting-point for ethical theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gosh I hope not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting to do ethical theory does not require throwing out all or
most of everyday thinking about ethics (even though the theories
themselves may produce results which are very counter-intuitive).
Ethical theory helps us to improve what we are already about how are
lives are going and how we can do better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the hope anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Happiness has the role of being, for each person, your happiness, the
way you achieve living your life well. It is not some plan imposed on
you from outside, or a demand made by some theory which has not arisen
from your own thoughts about your life. At the same time it is not just
anything you want it to be. There are better and worse ways of seeking
happiness, for there are clearly better and worse ways of organizing
your goals and aims in life, and of seeking to live a life that achieves
them overall.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems solidly true and important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is happiness in this role in eudaimonist thinking happiness as we
understand it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a good question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is one influential criticism of any account of happiness in
eudaimonist thinking. Answering it helps to indicate an important
feature of happiness. Grant that we all aim for something in our lives
overall, vaguely and without being able to specify it beforehand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not grant this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grant also that this is happiness, understood as a very general aim
which we can achieve in a number of ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still, happiness is the point where ordinary thought meets theory: to
achieve happiness we have to reflect about what we are doing to achieve
it, and how this could be improved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing maybe worth mentioning here is that this is a very Greek
attitude, and if you look at a Buddhist attitude they would argue that
almost exactly the opposite is true. Happiness comes from letting go of
attachment and being present in the moment.</p>
<p>(This is very oversimplified, IANABuddhist)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet surely it is both intuitively repugnant, and at the level of
theory objectionably paternalist, for some people to be in a position to
tell others how to be happy. Some philosophers recoil at this point,
seeing a spectre emerging from eudaimonism: some people imposing their
own vision of the good life on others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t know, a lot of people seem like they could use some advice
here. I think the problem is maybe <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-give-good-advice">that
those philosophers are bad at giving advice</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I start to reflect ethically there is much about my life which I
have to recognize as the material I have to work on. The first ethical
move is not to abstract from my individual context, still less to
discount it, but rather to understand what it consists in, to achieve
self-knowledge as far as I can, and then to think about how best to live
my life in these circumstances. Only then will I be in a good position
to consider the various options offered to me by different ethical
theories.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think this is a very important point.</p>
<p>From here I’m going to start skimming a bit more aggressively because
a lot of the next bits are philosophy-is-arguing-with-other-philosophers
and I’m running a bit low on time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saying anything negative about pleasure is often wrongly thought to
indicate puritanism. It is worth meeting this point by reflecting on the
role of pleasure in the kind of life we want our children to lead.
Suppose I am, ex hypothesi, not a puritan, and want my child to lead a
happy life. I will want my child to enjoy her activities and have
feelings of pleasure. But could this be what makes her life a happy one?
This strikes two wrong notes. I will scarcely think that my wish has
been granted if my child lives a life enjoying activities which are
degraded or addictive.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems right, although I will note that I rarely trust parents to
make a good judgement about “degraded” life choices.</p>
<p>That being said, I don’t know that whether I would say that this sort
of judgement is about the child’s <em>happiness</em>. I would tend to
assume that someone leading a hedonistic life, or a drug addict, isn’t
“really” happy but this feels like an empirical claim rather than a
self-evidently true one.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And even if an activity is a serious one, something has gone wrong if
the person’s life is made a happy one not by the activity but by the
feelings of enjoyment she gets from it. Any parent would be disconcerted
to find that their child had grown up to regard her life as happy
because of the enjoyment she got from, say, helping others, but would
unhesitatingly drop helping others the minute she ceased to enjoy it.
This is, once again, not an adult attitude. And this seems right even
before we are in a position to explain why something has gone wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same objection. This seems like a valid judgement, but not obviously
one that is about their happiness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One factor helping to explain why it goes wrong is the point that
pleasure lacks the right kind of relation to the rest of our moral
psychology. This has been called lack of ‘causal depth’.” If we think of
happiness as just feeling good, we cannot, for example, distinguish
between the different kinds of impact on a person of unwelcome
events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t want to comment on what your life is like, but I feel like if
you don’t realise that there are different levels of intensity of
feeling good you maybe need to get out more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a revealing example from Daniel Haybron, take two scenarios, in
one of which I have pleasant feelings and am feeling good, and then get
a flat tyre, while in the other I am feeling good, but then my child
dies. If happiness is just having pleasant feelings, the impact of these
two events would appear to be the same: first I have pleasant feelings,
then I don’t, having painful ones instead. Since it is absurd for a
theory not to be able to distinguish between these two ways of no longer
feeling good, a supporter of pleasure has to say that my loss of
pleasant feelings will be much more intense in the second case than in
the first. But this plainly fails to give us the right distinction.” The
real difference lies in the wider impacts and ramifications of the
second event; what is bad about it for me is not the intensity of loss
of good feeling and occurrence of painful feelings, but the wide and
connected effects in all areas of my life of this loss. Nothing like
this happens with the flat tyre, which puts a stop to pleasant feeling
but without wide or deep impact on my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems like a disingenuous argument. I don’t think it’s at all
hard to fit these examples into a pleasure view of happiness, because
they are things that affect your ability to feel pleasure - both in the
short and the long run.</p>
<p>Additionally, it seems like a “pure pleasure” view of happiness is an
obvious strawman of a view that is actually “presence of pleasure and
absence of pain”, which trivially incorporates these examples.</p>
<p>Now, as it happens, I don’t think pleasure provides a good account of
happiness, but I think these arguments against it are pretty weak.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea that happiness might just consist in feelings of pleasure or
the enjoyment of activities is not very plausible, once we bear in mind
the role of happiness as our final end, something in the achieving of
which we shape our lives. Pleasure is just not the right kind of item to
play this role. It becomes clear that if happiness is construed as
feelings of pleasure we have produced a conception of happiness which is
not only radically different from the eudaimonist one, but strikingly
trivialized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that it is striking how much you have trivialized it,
yes.</p>
<h3 id="in-conclusion">In Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’ve not reached the end of the chapter, but this is a good place to
stop given how much time is left on the timer. I’ll return to the
chapter later, probably tomorrow.</p>
<p>So far though I’ve been left pretty unhappy with the eudaimonist
account of happiness. Both because of the quality of the arguments I’ve
been savaging a bit up there, but more importantly the judgements seem
entirely wrong to me.</p>
<p>In particular I’m <em>really</em> unhappy with the goal orientation
here. I guess I should have expected no less from an ethical theory that
is oriented around the striving for excellence, but the more I stare at
those bits the more I feel like this part of virtue ethics is not only
wrong but actively misguided.</p>
<p>An argument I’ve been having on discord over the last few days is
whether virtue ethics is consequentialist. I think my current position
is that regardless of whether it <em>is</em> consequentialist,
discussions of it seem intimately bound up in ends, and that still seems
to be the case.</p>
<p>The thing I <em>didn’t</em> necessarily expect would be that that
this is the bit of the theory I <em>dislike</em>.</p>
