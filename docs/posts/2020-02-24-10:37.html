<h1 id="all-knowledge-is-connected">All knowledge is connected</h1>
<p>I read a lot. You might have noticed.</p>
<p>Additionally, I read a lot about a really broad range of
subjects.</p>
<p>It gives me a lot of really weird spikes in my skill set, and one of
my favourite things is getting about half an hour into a conversation
with some specialist and having them suddenly go “wait, hang on, aren’t
you a computer science? I forgot you weren’t actually in my field” when
I ask some really dumb question despite having been able to talk about
the subject at expert level up until then.</p>
<p>One of the things that you notice when you read this widely is that
(extremely Dirk Gently voice) everything is connected.</p>
<p>You may not think that understanding nuclear war has much to do with
understanding gender (ICBM dick jokes and recent controversial stories
about the militarization of gender technology aside), but Thomas
Schelling’s “The Strategy of Conflict” was one of the most informative
things I’ve read about gender until I read “The Origins of Unfairness”
which is more directly about the game theory of gender. These both tie
in well to “Conflict is not Abuse” (a book about speech norms in LGBT
and social justice communities), and to “Queer Phenomenology”, about how
we use gender to orient our way through society, or to “Models: Attract
Women through Honesty” (a surprisingly good book of dating advice for
men), or to Raewyn Connol’s “Masculinities”, or to…</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p>
<p>When I say “All knowledge is connected” I don’t mean that “Every
piece of knowledge is directly connected to every other piece of
knowledge”. The link between “The Strategy of Conflict” and “Models”
would not have been at all obvious without some of those other books as
intermediaries. I call such books <em>bridging books</em> - ones which
unify two previously unconnected things in a way that enriches your
understanding of all of them - but increasingly I think that limiting it
to books is too confining and I should just call them bridges.</p>
<p>One prompt for this was the paper I read recently on <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-16-14:22.html">ghost
knowledge</a>. This ruined the idea of bridging as a book specific thing
both by pointing out how much of the world’s knowledge isn’t written
down <em>anywhere</em>, let alone in books, and also by itself being a
bridge between <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-18-12:24.html">How to
talk about books you haven’t read</a>’s ideas about communal libraries
and the notions of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-06-04-09:58.html">hermeneutic
and contributory injustice</a> from the epistemic justice school of
thought.</p>
<p>A useful metaphor for understanding how this works is Susan Haack’s
<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02683186">Puzzling
out science</a>, and obscure-ish piece of philosophy of science. In it,
she argues that a great metaphor for the process of science and
reasoning about the world is the crossword puzzle. In a crossword puzzle
you have both the clues, and the grid. The clues are things you observe
about the world, and the grid is the thing that forces them to be
consistent with each other. You might fill in parts of the puzzle
independently of each other, and then try to join them up and discover
to your annoyance that this square that you thought was a “c” cannot
possibly be one and still fit with this other clue. The process of
solving a crossword puzzle is thus a constant tension between solving it
locally based on evidence and using the constraints to force updates to
other part of the puzzle when you discover inconsistencies.</p>
<p>This propagation is why the connectedness of knowledge matters:
Although there’s no real direct connection between nuclear war and
gender, there’s this long chain of connections, and updates in one place
might inform updates in others by propagating through that chain.</p>
