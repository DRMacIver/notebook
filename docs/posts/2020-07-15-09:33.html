<p>I’ve been thinking about “nice problems to have” as a phenomenon
recently. I have a feeling they’re widely misunderstood.</p>
<p>My standard response to the concept has often been “Yes but nice
problems to have are still problems”, but actually I think it goes
deeper than that: Nice problems to have are also rarely actually nice to
have. The phrase is misleading.</p>
<p>What we generally mean when we say “nice problem to have” is that the
<em>preconditions</em> for having this problem are nice to have.
i.e. you cannot have this problem unless some other nice thing happens
first. This is not at all a reliable predictor of the amount of
suffering involved.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, having all your friends and family constantly
making demands on you, far beyond your capacity to satisfy, to the point
where it would be emotionally exhausting even if you could say yes to
everyone but also you have to say no to most of them and they will
resent you for it. This is obviously an intensely painful problem,
right?</p>
<p>Now suppose it’s because you come from poverty and have landed a well
paid job. Suddenly it’s a “nice problem to have” (you have it because
you’re being well paid! Being well paid is good!), but that doesn’t
change how miserable it is.</p>
<p>The thing is, by definition, “nice problems to have” are ones that
are not going to be shared by a lot of people (otherwise the
preconditions would just be normal behaviour and it wouldn’t be a nice
problem to have). As a result:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Most people probably won’t be able to relate to it, because their
lived experiences will be so different.</li>
<li>People will be envious of you for the nice thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus the defining characteristic about nice problems to have is not
that they are nice, but that you will be afforded no sympathy for having
them. Nice problems to have are the opposite of nice: They isolate you
from the ability to <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-should-complain-about-it">complain
about them</a>, which removes a major bonding activity with people who
have not been successful in the same way as you, and also causes you to
feel worse about the problems with those who do not share your
burden.</p>
<p>There is a phenomenon of people succeeding and leaving their former
friends behind, and there are many very bad reasons why people do this,
but I suspect the nice problems to have issue is one of them: None of
their former friends are able to be remotely sympathetic to things that
are very real sources of their suffering (and indeed that unrelatability
of it is probably <em>part</em> of their suffering).</p>
<p>This is in many ways a variant of the <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/being-deep-in-an-abstraction-stack">abstraction
stack</a> problem - you need people around you who just <em>get</em> the
things you want to talk about - and the solution is probably the same:
Regardless of who else you hang out with (and you should hang out with a
variety of people) you do need <em>some</em> people you can talk to who
understand your problems, even if they’re supposedly nice problems to
have.</p>
