<p>There’s a thing that I do in the design of my discord server that to
me seems just absolutely blindingly obviously the correct way to do it,
and is also directly the opposite of how everyone else does it, in a way
that very obviously causes problems.</p>
<p>It’s this: A channel is an <em>invitation to start a conversation
about a subject</em>, not a place where <em>only that subject is
appropriate</em>.</p>
<p>For example, we’ve got the #games channel. This is a place where you
are invited to talk about games. Sometimes it’s also a place where we
talk about philosophy, or programming, or parenting… but it’s mostly
about games. Looking at the #games channel I don’t really see much that
isn’t about games recently, and that’s fine too.</p>
<p>There is one very big consequence of this approach: We almost never
have to have talk about something being off-topic and request moving it
to a different channel.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">There are a few cases where we do that, but it’s always
because of more specific rules than a general “stay on topic” category.
During the height of the pandemic, we tried to uh quarantine pandemic
chat to #pandemic, and the owner of a <a href="https://tasshin.com/blog/feeds-an-anthropological-report-on-a-powerful-online-social-technology/">feed</a>
can always ask for conversations to be moved elsewhere.</span> This removes a constant source of
background anxiety about staying on topic, and also it allows for many
conversations to occur that otherwise would be stifled.</p>
<p>The reason #games is a place to talk about anything isn’t because
people come to #games to talk about anything. It would be weird to just
randomly post a picture of your lunch in #games, because that’s not how
you start a conversation about #games. We don’t police that, it’s just
not a thing that people do because why would they? But if, for example,
you were talking about games you play with your kid, and it branched
into a more general conversation about parenting, that would be
absolutely fine, and the conversation could continue to be about
parenting for as long as you wanted it to, without any sense that you
were doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Another consequence of this approach is it changes when channels are
created. In the traditional approach, you create channels when volume on
a particular topic gets too high, and you want a place for it to go,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">We do occasionally do this of course. We created
#dubious-ontologies when sandwich discourse took over #chatter for the
third day running, and we branched off #slay-the-spire from #games
because Slay the Spire conversation was dominating too much and people
wanted a space where they could talk about games despite not being
interested in Slay the Spire.</span> while on my discord I create
channels when there’s a particular topic I want to encourage more
conversation about (or when someone else suggests similar) and creating
a channel for it invites that conversation.</p>
<p>On top of that… This system obviously works better on a bunch of
specific practical factors, but to me the most important part of it is
that it removes a general background level of… cop behaviour from the
discord. In places where there’s a big focus on staying on topic, it
feels like everyone is constantly policing other people using a channel
wrong, and everyone is constantly worried that they might be using a
channel wrong, and this creates a pervasive background of low-grade
suspicion and anxiety that I don’t think is good for anyone, and in
general I really recommend designing systems that don’t make everyone
lightly miserable.</p>
