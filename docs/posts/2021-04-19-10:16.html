<p>I play a lot of Slay the Spire.</p>
<p>Slay the Spire is a game where you build up a deck of cards, which
you use to fight a series of battles of varying difficulty.</p>
<p>You ascend through the levels of the spire, until at the end of the
game you attempt to defeat its heart.</p>
<p>The game is divided into four acts, at the end of each of which you
fight a boss.</p>
<p>The heart is the boss of the fourth act.</p>
<p>To get to Act 4, you must collect three keys before the end of Act
3.</p>
<p>If you do not, the game ends early, with “Victory?” instead of
“Victory”</p>
<p>Slay the Spire has four characters, Ironclad, Silent, Defect, and
Watcher.</p>
<p>My preference goes Defect, Ironclad, Silent, Watcher, from favourite
to least favourite.</p>
<p>Slay the Spire has a series of difficulties called “Ascension
levels”.</p>
<p>Ascension levels go from 0 to 20.</p>
<p>You start at Ascension 0, and every time you complete Act 3 on an
ascension level, you unlock the next one for that character.</p>
<p>I would like to be able to defeat the heart on Ascension 20 with each
character.</p>
<p>So far I have managed this only with Defect.</p>
<p>I am currently working on defeating the heart on Ascension 20 with
Ironclad.</p>
<p>My current, more modest, goal is to defeat Act 3, but so far I have
not even been able to manage that.</p>
<p>This is somewhat frustrating.</p>
<p>I’ve tried quite a few times at this point.</p>
<p>Probably not more than 10, but still.</p>
<p>The problem is that I am no longer getting better at it, at least not
very quickly.</p>
<p>I have identified a strategy that would likely allow me to beat the
heart, but I am very bad at it.</p>
<p>To tell you about this strategy, I must first tell you about
relics.</p>
<p>Relics are items you acquire as you ascend the spire, which modify
your abilities.</p>
<p>Each character has a starter relic, unique to them.</p>
<p>The Ironclad’s starter relic is called “burning blood”, and it heals
you slightly at the end of each fight.</p>
<p>One way to think about this is that it makes the game slightly
easier, without making your character more powerful.</p>
<p>This is not entirely right, but it’s pretty close.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, you encounter Neow, who offers you a
blessing.</p>
<p>One of the blessings you can get is to swap your starter relic for a
random boss relic.</p>
<p>Boss relics are very different from the Ironclad starter relic, in
that most of them make the game harder while also making your character
more powerful.</p>
<p>Anyway, I noticed that I was never taking boss relic swap, because I
liked the Ironclad starter relic too much.</p>
<p>This suggested that my way through Ascension 20 might be to learn to
boss relic swap on Ironclad.</p>
<p>I tried this, and I died badly every time, because Ascension 20 is
too hard for me to experiment on.</p>
<p>So I went back down to Ascension 0.</p>
<p>But even with the boss relic swap, Ascension 0 is very easy for me
now.</p>
<p>Slay the Spire is not an easy game, so a year or two ago this would
have been inconceivable, but I’ve played more than 600 hours of it since
then.</p>
<p>I’m not <em>amazing</em> at the game, but I’m quite good at it and,
as a result, I can all but sleepwalk my way through Ascension 0, even
with the harder tactics.</p>
<p>So I decided that it wasn’t enough for me to just beat act 3, I had
to beat the heart to advance.</p>
<p>The idea being that I have to learn to overshoot my goal.</p>
<p>This starts to be at least a little difficult, even at the lower
ascension levels.</p>
<p>Enough that I have to pay attention, certainly.</p>
<p>This approach lets me take advantage of the tighter feedback loops at
lower ascension levels to focus on the parts of the game that I am still
bad at.</p>
<p>It removes slack.</p>
<p>As a result I must be consistently good to progress, instead of just
lucky.</p>
<p>I will still progress by luck to some degree, because the game is
hard enough that if you get unlucky you can die, even at lower ascension
levels.</p>
<p>But luck can only get you so far, and the changes I have made force
me to develop more consistent skill.</p>
<p>This is a bit like an idea called Mastery Training.</p>
<p>Mastery Training is an approach where in order to learn something,
you must master what comes before it.</p>
<p>For example, requiring an A in all the prerequisite courses before
you’re allowed to take a course.</p>
<p>This isn’t always a good idea.</p>
<p>I suspect it’s often a bad idea.</p>
<p>But what I’m doing here is an interesting variant of it.</p>
<p>It is not mastery, but remastery.</p>
<p>I have “completed the course” that is Ascensions 0 through 19.</p>
<p>And now I’m retaking them, but with additional constraints, and
trying to retake them at a higher level.</p>
<p>I am relearning “familiar subjects” with the goal of getting an A in
them this time.</p>
<p>The theory being that what is holding me back from progressing past
my current level might be a lack of consistency at the foundations.</p>
<p>This seems like a good general lesson to apply.</p>
<p>When we are stuck, start again from the beginning, but this time you
have to do it <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>You have a clear path you walked before.</p>
<p>You know the way.</p>
<p>But now you must walk it again.</p>
<p>This time carrying weights.</p>
<p>Or paying careful attention to how you place your feet.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should do this more generally?</p>
<p>When we have something that is too hard, we replace it with something
that is too easy, but done differently.</p>
<p>For example, when we have reached a point where we feel our writing
has plateaued, we start again with simpler writing, but done
differently.</p>
<p>Perhaps with a writing exercise where we change the cadence of our
writing.</p>
<p>And talk about mundane subjects.</p>
<p>And use this to practice our voice, or our editing.</p>
<p>You know, hypothetically.</p>
