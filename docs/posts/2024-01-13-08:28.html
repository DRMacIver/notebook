<p>I was talking to <a href="https://nelhage.com/">Nelson</a> about
programming abstractions the other day, and how you identify a good
abstraction, and I hit on a heuristic that once I suggested it seemed
obviously correct to me but that is very at odds with how I think people
normally think about introducing abstractions in their codebase.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I don’t mean anything fancy by abstraction. Implementing
a new class or a new function for example.</span></p>
<p>It’s this: When you introduce an abstraction, it has to be an
improvement at each call site. That is, even if you never reuse it, it
should be make your code better.</p>
<p>Another way of thinking about this: If you implemented this, and then
you deleted all but one of the call sites, would you be tempted to
inline the abstraction? If yes, you shouldn’t do it. If you were in a
fresh codebase and wanted to do something similar to your previous uses
of the abstraction, would you inclined to copy the previous abstraction
into your codebase in order to make use of it? That’s a sign that it’s
probably a pretty good abstraction.</p>
<p>In contrast, I think most people’s intuitions about abstraction are
around reducing code duplication. You introduce a function when you see
duplicate code, because duplicate code is bad and you want to reduce it.
I think this intuition is almost entirely wrong. It leads you to create
bad abstractions, sometimes where you didn’t even need one at all, and
it also means you miss important abstractions that you could have
introduced even without any duplication.</p>
<p>Now, it’s not that duplication can’t be the <em>prompt</em> for
abstraction. In the conversation Nelson and I were having, I’d
introduced a class that managed a bunch of state for gathering
statistics about some work in progress and doing cleanup when particular
conditions were met. Originally I wrote that logic and state inline in
the class managing those tasks. Then I needed it again, in a slightly
different way with slightly different constraints, so I extracted a
class for the common state and logic. This is a perfectly reasonable
example of abstraction in the classic sense of reducing duplication.</p>
<p>But also, even before I’d written the second call site, the code got
much cleaner, because doing this made me think about the actual
interface I wanted, and I replaced a bunch of raw calls to heapq and set
management with a nice API that declared what I was actually doing. This
was a big improvement.</p>
<p>The repetition served the following purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>It was a <em>prompt</em> to think “Can I abstract this?”</li>
<li>By the fact that I had needed it twice, I had a better idea of how
to abstract it.</li>
<li>It <em>justified the work of making the abstraction</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The third is an important clarification of the heuristic: It’s not
that the abstraction has to be justifiable without the duplication.
There are two things to consider when making a change: How much of an
improvement it is, and how much effort it is to implement. An
abstraction that is a lot of work for only a mild improvement might not
be worth it for one call site but clearly worth it if you’re going to
use it in multiple places.</p>
<p>I think the best way to think about abstraction is that its purpose
is to <em>make programming less annoying</em>. Writing the same code
over and over again is annoying, and abstraction can reduce that
annoyance, but it only reduces the annoyance if the abstracted code is
actually less annoying than repeating yourself.</p>
<p>This judgement of annoyance does of course require developing a
degree of taste, which makes it somewhat uninformative if you’re just
starting out. Here are some ways code can be annoying that’s worth
factoring out:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’ve got multiple pieces of state that are always used
together, it can be worth putting them together into an object if you
can figure out a clean API for that object.</li>
<li>Similarly, if there are a lot of intermediate variables that aren’t
used outside of calculation, it might be worth extracting a function to
reduce their visibility - it means you don’t have to keep track of where
they’re used, and it’s harder to make stupid typos where you
accidentally refer to a different variable where you mean.</li>
<li>If a function is really hard to follow, it can be worth extracting
parts of it into smaller functions. e.g. recently I refactored a
function to just extract the bodies of various branches of an if
statement into functions. Those functions will never be called from
anywhere else, but the control flow of the code was impossible to follow
in a way that had previously masked a bug.</li>
<li>If code is irritating to get right, it can be worth thinking about
whether there is an abstraction that makes it easier to get right. For
example, it can be useful to factor out error handling into context
managers in Python.</li>
<li>Sometimes there is a sort of logical “abstract algorithm” to code
that is worth factoring out into a higher order function. e.g. I’ve
talked about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-04-30-13:03.html"><code>find_integer</code></a>
before, which I end up reusing all over the place.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the other direction, it’s probably better not to introduce an
abstraction if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires introducing a function with a lot of arguments.</li>
<li>It significantly increases the number of lines of code when you
first introduce it at one call site.</li>
<li>The abstraction is significantly complicated by different needs from
different call sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, I think it’s worth erring on the side of not abstracting.
If you’re not feeling the pain of not abstracting, it’s probably
fine.</p>
<p>For example, here’s some code I often write variations of<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">I work on test-case reduction, so this sort of thing
comes up a lot. I’m aware that almost nobody else regularly needs to
write code that looks like this. Also yes I’m aware of the quadratic
nature of this code. It’s fine, I promise. It’s not <a href="https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/">accidentally
quadratic</a>, it’s intrinsically quadratic because the
<code>can_delete</code> checks are already O(n) and have much higher
constant factors.</span>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-1" tabindex="-1"></a>i <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">while</span> i <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="bu">len</span>(ls):</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-3" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> can_delete(ls, i):</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-4" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="kw">del</span> ls[i]</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-5" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb1-6" tabindex="-1"></a>        i <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="dv">1</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<p>And this code is a bit fiddly and I could definitely do something
along the lines of:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-1" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">class</span> DeletableListIterator:</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-2" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="fu">__init__</span>(<span class="va">self</span>, ls):</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-3" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="va">self</span>.ls <span class="op">=</span> ls</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-4" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="va">self</span>.i <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-5" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-6" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">def</span> <span class="fu">__iter__</span>(<span class="va">self</span>):</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-7" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="cf">while</span> <span class="va">self</span>.i <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="bu">len</span>(<span class="va">self</span>.ls):</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-8" tabindex="-1"></a>            <span class="cf">yield</span> <span class="va">self</span>.i</span>
<span id="cb2-9"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-9" tabindex="-1"></a>            i <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="dv">1</span></span>
<span id="cb2-10"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-10" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb2-11"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-11" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="kw">def</span> delete(<span class="va">self</span>):</span>
<span id="cb2-12"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-12" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="kw">del</span> <span class="va">self</span>.ls[<span class="va">self</span>.i]</span>
<span id="cb2-13"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb2-13" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="va">self</span>.i <span class="op">-=</span> <span class="dv">1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then I could use this as:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb3-1" tabindex="-1"></a>list_iterator <span class="op">=</span> DeletableListIterator(ls)</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb3-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">for</span> i <span class="kw">in</span> list_iterator:</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb3-3" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> can_delete(ls, i):</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb3-4" tabindex="-1"></a>        list_iterator.delete()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And it’s not really an improvement. I find this if anything slightly
harder to follow than the original, though there’s not much in it. But
more importantly, sometimes I want to write code like the following:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a>i <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-2" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">while</span> i <span class="op">&lt;</span> <span class="bu">len</span>(ls):</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-3" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">if</span> can_delete(ls, i, i <span class="op">+</span> k):</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-4" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="kw">del</span> ls[i:i<span class="op">+</span>k]</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-5" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span class="cf">else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#cb4-6" tabindex="-1"></a>        i <span class="op">+=</span> <span class="dv">1</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<p>And now I need to fiddle with the implementation to support this
too.</p>
<p>There is almost certainly an abstraction that would make support this
well - e.g. from what I know of C++’s iterator protocol it seems
probably actually quite good for this.</p>
<p>But also… this code is fine without it? It’s a bit weird, and
slightly ugly, but it’s not actually hard to get right, it’s not a lot
longer than it needs to be, and once you’re familiar with the pattern
it’s pretty straightforward to work with.</p>
<p>None of this is to discourage you from creating abstractions in
general. I’m a big fan of well factored code. But it’s easy to abstract
too much, or abstract the wrong things, and I think paying attention to
what’s irritating about working on your codebase and fixing that is a
good way to prioritise.</p>
