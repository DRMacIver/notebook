<p>One of my most read posts is <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/people-dont-work-as-much-as-you-think">People
don’t work as much as you think</a>. In it, I report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is my estimate of how much work I can get done in a day:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Most days I can do somewhere between one and two hours of hard
thinky work. Writing, programming, etc. Good days or easy tasks it might
be three. It’s rarely four, and over a week almost never averages more
than two.</li>
<li>I can probably do some low effort reading, not very high quality
code review (more at the level of “scan for obvious flaws” than “do an
in depth study of the design”) on top of that without it massively
eating into my energy levels.</li>
<li>Four hours of coaching in a day, i.e. face to face time in which I
have to be on and intelligently responding, is pretty close to my
absolute limit - I can do five in a push but I will not be very
competent for the fifth - and I cannot do this two days running. I have
estimated 20 hours to be my absolute upper bound for coaching I could do
in a week, and I’ve set my comfortable limit as 10 hours if I want to be
able to maintain little things like getting any writing done or having
remotely functional mental health1.</li>
<li>I can probably do 4-6 hours of very routine stuff (e.g. mostly
mechanical refactoring of code).</li>
<li>I can sometimes do 4-6 hours of flow-state work (e.g. debugging a
hard problem). This requires a problem with tight feedback loops, no
interruptions, and a good physical and mental health day. I almost never
get this combination at the moment, and when I had normal jobs this
happened maybe a couple of times per year for a few days running at most
each time.</li>
<li>Idlework, where I think about a problem in the background while
going for a walk or having a shower or the like, is mostly free.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve got longstanding problems with <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1711673235891257441">stamina</a>
and energy levels that I want to improve. My health isn’t great, and I
suffer from something that isn’t really chronic fatigue but is certainly
chronic and certainly fatigue. It’s what the doctors dismissively call
“tired all the time”.</p>
<p>A lot of these things feel like very intrinsic hard limits where it’s
not that I don’t want to do more, it’s that I hit some sort of block
where my brain stops working and I couldn’t do more if I wanted.</p>
<p>Anyway, recently (last few weeks, plus a good chunk of December) I’ve
been working pretty solid six to eight hour days. I’ve also been ending
these days… mostly fine? I’m noticeably a bit tired, but it’s not like I
get to the end of the day and I’m dead. I’ve felt much worse on days
I’ve done much less.</p>
<p>I don’t know if this will continue to be the case. I doubt it’s fully
long-term sustainable,<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">and even if it is, it’s come with some fairly
significant downsides in terms of available capacity for non-work things
which is a problem.</span> but it also doesn’t feel like I’ve
been pushing myself <em>especially</em> hard to achieve it.</p>
<p>As the rationalists say, I notice that I am confused.</p>
<p>Part of this is definitely a mix of my schedule and the project I’m
on. Here’s roughly how that goes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>I wake up whenever I like<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Or at least whenever my body likes, which is not always
the same thing.</span>. Sometimes to an alarm,
often not. This might be any time between 7AM (if I’ve slept well and
got to bed on time) or 10AM (if I haven’t or didn’t).</li>
<li>The morning is mostly not spent working. I check project Slack, I
check on any jobs that have run overnight, anything I want to be ready
for the afternoon I start running and write whatever I need to do to
enable that. On a busy morning or one that starts early this might add
up to two hours work. Most mornings it’s probably somewhere in the half
hour to hour region. Mostly though I potter around, do home things,
write, etc, and do whatever is needed to gradually become human.
Sometimes I eat breakfast, sometimes I don’t.</li>
<li>At around noon through one I have lunch. This is usually a full
meal.</li>
<li>At 1PM I switch into full on work mode. I work pretty solidly on
code for the next four hours until people in US time zones start waking
up.</li>
<li>From about 5PM to 7PM I may still be working solo but I’m probably
in calls or meetings for at least half of it.</li>
<li>As close to 7PM sharp as I can, I close my work computer and stop
working.</li>
<li>Sometimes I’ll do about another half an hour of work over the course
of the rest of the evening as I check on running jobs, etc. I try not
to.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of these details feel essential to how much I’ve been getting
done - the flexible mornings, the large chunk of flow state work, the
transition out of flow state work to work with other people, and the
hard cut off.</p>
<p>I don’t <em>think</em> these are sufficient though. Certainly I’ve
had, you know, jobs before, and I wasn’t this reliably productive in
them. What I’m describing would be possible on a good day, but good days
were in short supply.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of everything that might be being helpful about the
work itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>It might be the nature of the work. It’s at a very good level for me
where it’s at the cutting edge of my skill but not beyond it. There’s
always something I can obviously do, but it’s never obvious that it’s
going to work and I’m constantly having to learn new things in order to
do it (while generally being able to learn them as I go rather than
having a huge amount of moving parts all of which I have to stand)</li>
<li>This is the most consistently my primary focus has been on writing
code in a while and I’ve definitely spent the last few years starved for
<a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/two-types-of-work">crunchy
work</a>.</li>
<li>There’s very little uncertainty in what I do next. The incoming task
queue is very well saturated.</li>
<li>The fact that I do not usually have meetings until the end of the
day helps a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>And some tmore general things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I quit caffeine for a while and resumed in mid December, and my
caffeine intake has been gradually ramping up in line with this, so it’s
very plausible that I am currently in a period where caffeine actually
works for the first time in a while and that’s helping.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">My relationship with caffeine is so annoyingly
problematic. It’s both great for me and terrible for me.</span></li>
<li>I am working in a room with a very bright corn bulb, which I started
doing to combat seasonal depression. I started this year <em>very</em>
depressed before I got back into the swing of things, so clearly
something is working for that.</li>
<li>Relatedly, I started daily writing again a little bit before my
productivity took off at the beginning of this year, and that too has
been very helpful for depression.</li>
<li>My diet is OK at the moment (not great) and I’m taking a probiotic
pretty reliably.</li>
<li>I’m doing regular pilates and jumping on a trampoline a lot<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">We made it for the child, but I’m the second biggest
user. Well, I’m the biggest user, but I’m the second most frequent
user.</span></li>
<li>The pilates has significantly reduced my chronic joint pain
issues.</li>
<li>Things are going pretty well in my personal life. Not perfectly,
everything is more than a bit stressful right now, but on balance
everything is trending in a good direction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s are some things that it probably isn’t:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2023-02-14-23:37.html">Inositol</a>.
I’ve been forgetting to take it reliably recently. I should fix that but
it hasn’t felt necessary.</li>
<li>Other supplements. I was trying a whole bunch of things before and I
mostly lost the habit and haven’t resumed. I’m drinking <a href="https://drinkag1.com/en-uk">Athletic Greens</a> a couple times a
week when it feels like I’m lacking in something, but I don’t know if
that’s really doing anything.</li>
<li>Non-caffeine stimulants. “Take amphetamines” is the most common
advice I’ve seen for this level of hyper productivity. I haven’t needed
to take amphetamines to achieve this. I experimented a bit with nicotine
lozenges in December but it mostly made me nauseous (I’ve had some luck
with it before and may try again).<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">That being said, my state of mind does feel a bit like
it used to when I took modafinil, a thing I definitely did legally and
with a prescription don’t do drugs kids. There’s a similar level of
singlemindedness of focus and slight irritability at things that intrude
on that focus. I’m even ending the day with my appetite feeling somewhat
suppressed. But this is genuinely without taking any stimulant stronger
than caffeine so no idea why.</span></li>
<li>Some fundamental shift in the nature of my being. It doesn’t feel
unprecedented to have days like this, only to have them this reliably.
All of the sensations are familiar, it’s just unfamiliar that it keeps
happening.</li>
<li>I don’t think I’ve actually fixed my health problems. They’re all
still there, they just feel less like bottlenecks right now.</li>
<li>My chronic headaches are still there and in fact I have a mild
headache most of the time right now.<label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"></label><input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/><span class="sidenote">Another thing that feels similar to taking modafinil.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing maybe worth noting is that there was a significantly
dip in this around the end of the holiday season. As mentioned, I
started the year massively depressed, and it took a little bit to get
back into the flow of it, and I had to gradually ramp up into this state
over a period of a few days.</p>
<p>My best guess is that the core of it is that spending energy is
actually energising rather than debilitating, as long as you can
experience the demands on you as eustress rather than destress. I’m not
sure I’ll be able to continue that, and it’s very very likely that
there’s some sort of hidden precondition that I’ve not identified, but
fingers crossed that it stays this way.</p>
