<p>I had some half-formed thoughts about test-case reduction that I
wanted to work through, and this notebook is a place for working through
half-formed thoughts, so here we go…</p>
<p>The thing I’ve been working on on and off for about a month now is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-05-11:29.html">using
language inference to figure out new reduction passes</a>.</p>
<p>It can be thought of as a way of taking an idea that doesn’t work
(using L* for test case reduction) and combining it with an idea that
works but doesn’t generalise well (learning a table of small string
substitutions to make), and getting an idea that does work and does
generalise.</p>
<p>This has me thinking: What, exactly, does it mean for an approach to
test-case reduction to generalise?</p>
<p>Also <em>does</em> this approach generalise well? The big question
with it is basically whether it works well when you change the
interestingness test. I think it will, but it probably depends a lot on
the choice of interestingness test and how close your reducer is to
normalising it already.</p>
<p>In the approach to test-case reduction I favour, test-case reduction
starts from set of test cases <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and
a total order <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> called the <em>reduction order</em>,
and a test-case reducer is a function <span class="math inline">\(r(U,
x)\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(x \in U \subseteq
X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r(U, x) \in U\)</span>, and
<span class="math inline">\(r(U, x) \preceq x\)</span>. For me usually
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a set of strings and <span class="math inline">\(\preceq\)</span> is the shortlex order where <span class="math inline">\(x \preceq y\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(|x| &lt; |y|\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(|x| = |y|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \leq y\)</span> lexicographically.</p>
<p>Your prototypical test-case reducer starts from a bunch of small-step
reductions, which gives you a function <span class="math inline">\(t: X
\to X^{&lt;\omega}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(t(x)_i
\prec x\)</span>, and the reducer greedily tries each of <span class="math inline">\(t(x)_i\)</span> in order. If none of them are in
<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> it returns <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, otherwise it it recurses and returns
<span class="math inline">\(r(U, t(x)_i)\)</span> for the first <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(t(x)_i
\in U\)</span>.</p>
<p>More generally given such a function we might say that a reducer is
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-local if it satisfies the
following conditions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(t(U, x) = x\)</span> if and only if
<span class="math inline">\(t(x)_i \not\in U\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</li>
<li>For all <span class="math inline">\(U, x\)</span> is some sequence
<span class="math inline">\(x = x_0, \ldots, x_n = r(U, x)\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(x_{i + 1} \in t(x)_i\)</span> (note that we
don’t necessarily require that <span class="math inline">\(x_i \in
U\)</span>).</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, basically a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-local
reducer is one that looks like the prototypical reducer but may have
some optimisations and fiddly bits. e.g. delta debugging is a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> local reducer where <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is maps <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to all test cases that can be formed by
deleting a single element of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.
Delta debugging starts by trying large bulk combinations of these
deletions and gradually narrows it down until it’s only trying the small
ones. Another approach which uses the same <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> but a different algorithm is what I’ve
called <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/06/adaptive-delta-debugging/">adaptive
delta debugging</a>.</p>
<p>Most reducers implemented in practice are roughly <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-local for some <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> (often they fail to be <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-local in some cases because they hit
some internal limit and stop when they could be making more progress,
and rerunning the reducer may produce further redctions) and I think
this is good because it allows you to reason in terms of what
transformations they are capable of performing.</p>
<p>So lets assume we have a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-local
reducer. What makes it good?</p>
<p>Basically the tradeoff is this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The larger <span class="math inline">\(|t(x)|\)</span> tends to be
the better you will reduce <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</li>
<li>The smaller <span class="math inline">\(|t(x)|\)</span> is the
better your reducer tends to perform.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ideal seems to be that you want <span class="math inline">\(|t(x)| = O(|x|)\)</span>, as per delta debugging,
and the trick is to tweak the set within that constraints to try to get
good results.</p>
<p>(Note that having <span class="math inline">\(|t(x)| =
O(|x|)\)</span> doesn’t mean that the overall reducer runs in <span class="math inline">\(O(|x|)\)</span> - even if you reduce the size at
every step you can easily be made to make <span class="math inline">\(O(|x|^2)\)</span> membership checks, and if you
just make lexicographic transformations it’s easy for performance to get
exponentially bad)</p>
<p>The problem that you run into is that basically what you really want
is not just for <span class="math inline">\(|t(x)|\)</span> to be large,
but for it to contain values that are in some sense “likely to be in
<span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>”. One way this can fail to happen
is when there is some sort of precondition on the range of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> we are interested in. The biggest
example of this is when interesting test cases have to be syntactically
valid according to some grammar. When this happens, effectively you are
censoring <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> by replacing it with
its syntactically valid subset. Often when something like delta
debugging gets stuck it’s not because it’s not because of any intrinsic
limitation related to the interestingness test, it’s just ended up at a
point where <span class="math inline">\(t(x)\)</span> contains no
syntactically valid test-cases.</p>
<p>So, essentially what we want in order to get a good reducer for a
format is to try to ensure that <span class="math inline">\(t(x)\)</span> is always well populated with
<em>syntactically valid</em> reductions of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>One way to do this might be to artificially construct interestingness
tests that are basically designed to expose small reductions. I’m not
quite sure what those would be. One thing I was thinking of is having
interestingness tests of where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is
interesting if <span class="math inline">\(y \preceq x\)</span> for some
fixed <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, then once those are
normalised gradually “censor” the tests by removing all intermediate
parts, stopping when you can’t learn anything other than the direct jump
to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>This can be thought of as ensuring that whenever the final reduced
result is <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> you have as rich a set
of paths leading to it as the learning process is possibly able to
find.</p>
<p>I don’t yet know how likely this is to work. I’m planning to do more
experiments soon on getting this running on hypothesis-csmith and we’ll
see how well it can learn that, but I think there’s some interesting
stuff to investigate here.</p>
