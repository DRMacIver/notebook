<p>When I mentioned to a friend that I was reading this she said "Oh is that actually good? I assumed it was pop science trash". It is actually good and it's not pop science trash.</p>
<p>There are roughly two interesting bits to this book:</p>
<ol>
<li>Advocating for a particular attitude to life.</li>
<li>A lot of anecdotes about space and what the life of an astronaut is like.</li>
</ol>
<p>I found both sides of the book interesting, although I think the life advice would have fallen very flat without the space component,
while the space component might have stood just fine on its own.</p>
<p>Some of the attitude stuff that is advocated for:</p>
<ul>
<li>work hard</li>
<li>over plan for everything</li>
<li>be a team player</li>
<li>don't be afraid to shoot for your ultimate goal but arrange your life so that if you don't achieve it that's OK</li>
<li>have an awful lot of under-acknowledged privilege (Helene Hadfield is in many ways the true hero of the story)</li>
</ul>
<p>I've been thinking about trying to get better at strategic planning, and this book was a useful nudge in that direction.
In particular there's a bunch of advice in there for <em>constructively</em> over-thinking things which might be useful.
The main gist is that rather than worrying about everything that might go wrong and stressing about it as a result,
worry about everything that that might go wrong and <em>plan what you will do when it does</em>.</p>
