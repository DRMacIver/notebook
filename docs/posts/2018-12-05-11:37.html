<p>I really like this book. It has a few flaws that annoy me slightly
and are worth commenting on, but it’s basically a very good book. I
can’t personally say if it <em>works</em>, as my foreign language skills
are extremely poor and I’m not actively working on that (I have at
various points spoken French and German badly, and I can mostly still
puzzle them out in written form, but it would be a lie to say I really
speak them), but even without that context I think it’s a good book.</p>
<p>Fundamentally this is a book about how to have a conversation, and
how to develop sets of concrete communication skills that allow that to
work for you. This is particularly valuable when speaking in a language
that you don’t know very well, but I think the lessons are important for
native speakers as well - in particular the advice on how to deal with
stalled conversations is something that I think most people should
learn.</p>
<p>The book is very short, so I won’t try to summarise its lessons here,
and I’d just recommend reading it instead, but I would add two
caveats:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Some of the specifics of his advice will come across as
<em>extremely</em> rude. In particular he recommends changing the
subject by saying “I’m not really interested in this subject”. Don’t do
that. Say “I don’t know very much about this subject” or similar. The
former comes across as saying “Your interests are boring”.</li>
<li>The strategy of inserting colloquialisms into your speech in order
to sound more natural is high variance. It is very obvious when a
foreign speaker is doing this badly, and it starts to grate. As a native
speaker it is my responsibility to have patience with foreign speakers
(and when the roles are reversed I hope they would grant me the same),
so by all means go for it, just be aware of this dynamic.</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect if you were to use this book as it is intended then it
would be very helpful to practice all of these techniques with a trusted
friend who is fluent (ideally native speaking) in the target
language.</p>
<p>This book is staying on my shelves for circulation to friends who are
interested in it and maybe the occasional reread (this was already my
second reading of it).</p>
