&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Journaling as a foundational practice&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-16&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is another draft bankruptcy, excerpted from another abandoned
book project. Most of the rest of the project is very sketchy but this
is one of the more fleshed out chapters.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Journaling is writing about your life, ideally every day, in a way
that helps you observe key things about it, understand them, and start
to improve them. It returns you to the question of what’s going on in
your life and how you can understand it and improve it over and over
again. It helps you figure out what matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that I wish I had kept up as a practice
throughout the last five years, it’s daily journaling. Every time I’ve
done it it’s been important and transformative and then for one reason
or another I’ve just… stopped.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Editor’s note: Don’t ask how well I’m doing on this
right now please…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Continuity of journaling practice is hard, and the design of the
practice matters both for feeling like you’re getting something out of
it and for making it robust against failure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is what I currently consider an ideal journaling practice:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Journaling is done by hand, with a fountain pen, in an A5 notebook.
For reference, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B8M88JW9"&gt;I use
this one&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it’s reasonably well designed for the purpose,
but it’s nothing special. Write on some flat surface, with your arm well
supported (note: I am still figuring out ideal writing posture, and may
need to update this advice). Pages in the journal should be dated. I
usually only add a date for the first page of every day (dating every
page is also fine, I just rarely bother). I have a dedicated writing
desk from which phones and computers are banned, but this may be hard to
find space for.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You should have a foundational journaling prompt that you use every
day. The idea of the foundational prompt is that it takes you straight
into just writing without having to make decisions about what to write
about, and it creates a diverse range of different starting points to
get you to examine things from many different angles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mine is this: I draw a tarot card from a standard Rider-Waite-Smith
deck, I consult Joan Bunning’s “Big Book of Tarot” entry for that card.
I read the description of the card out loud. I then write two pages
inspired by it. “Inspired” can be anything that feels right. Often I
pick out some characteristic from the list of characteristics that
describes some problem I’m currently having. Sometimes the card lands
with a big “ouch, too accurate” and I know exactly what to write.
Sometimes the card completely fails to land and I instead describe the
&lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of the card’s qualities from my life. If the card is a
court card I often talk about what it would be like to be the person
represented.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are comfortable with Tarot (this does not require attributing
any mystical significance to it. I don’t), I recommend adopting this as
your specific practice. If you want to try it out without committing to
buying a deck and the book, you can use &lt;a href="https://randomtarotcard.com/"&gt;https://randomtarotcard.com/&lt;/a&gt; for
your card draw and look up the card in &lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/cards.htm"&gt;http://www.learntarot.com/cards.htm&lt;/a&gt;
(which is by the same author as the book I use, but the book often has
expanded descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you’re not comfortable with tarot, I’ll list some alternative
prompts further down.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Note: In actual fact I currently do not my foundational journaling
in my journal, I’m doing it on A4 sheets, because I started it as a
project of working through the deck one card at a time without
replacement and introduced the journal midway through and want to
complete the deck before I switch over to the journal. This section may
be updated if I discover that the switchover doesn’t work, but I have
used a tarot deck this way in the past and expect it to work fine)&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Editor’s note: This project has now been completed. See
&lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/completing-completable-projects"&gt;Completing
completable projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The goal is that the foundational journaling should be done by noon.
If you notice that it is after noon, you should treat it as a matter of
some urgency to go complete it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Immediately after you have done your foundational journaling, you
will ideally write another page of journaling about anything you feel
like writing about. If literally nothing comes to mind, don’t worry
about it. This page is not a requirement of the practice, it’s just a
point at which you are invited to journal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, you should try to journal in whole pages. Keep writing
until the page is full, and then stop. As you notice you’re coming to
the end of a page, try to sum up or fine some appropriate way to drop
the mic at the end.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something else I find useful is to light a candle while journaling.
The way the candle works is that it serves as a sort of anchor: If the
candle is lit, I’m supposed to be journaling. If I notice it is lit, I
should make a decision to go back to journaling or snuff it out. As long
as I’ve completed my foundational journaling, it’s fine to choose to
stop journaling, the candle just serves as a reminder to make the
decision.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day if at any point you feel like you need to think
something through or want to express something, go write a page in your
journal about it. The ideal is to cultivate the journal as something you
&lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to use and keep going back to. There is no such thing as
too much journaling as long as most pages you write in your journal feel
productive to have written.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id="debugging-notes"&gt;Debugging Notes&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a good opportunity to practise debugging.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Editor’s note: This is partly a reference to a previous
chapter on debugging in this book attempt, but I never actually wrote
that chapter. I may attempt to turn its stub into a notebook post at
some point soon.&lt;/span&gt;
Chances are, if you try to copy the above verbatim, you’ll run into some
problems. I don’t know what they are (if you do run into some problems,
please tell me! I’d like to debug them with you)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I promise that the daily journaling habit is going to be worth it, so
it’s worth spending some time figuring out why it isn’t working for you
and changing that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here are some variants you can try for the physical form:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can, if you must, journal on the computer. I think it’s a bad
idea, but the best system is the one you can actually follow, so if you
hate handwriting and can’t bring yourself to do it, don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can reduce the volume of journaling, either by writing fewer
pages, switching to a smaller journal, allowing yourself to stop at the
half page mark, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could journal on disposable paper - write it on an A4 sheet and
then shred it if you don’t want to keep it around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment with different pens and journals. Do you hate fountain
pens? Do you prefer squared over lined? etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For the content you could try different foundational practices.
e.g.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick some book of special significance to you (a bible for example,
but it could also be a favourite novel) and use that as a source of
prompts. Turn to a random page, read the page out loud, and focus in on
some passage that feels salient in some way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than having a special book, you could have a book that you
rotate. Pick some book of your shelves, use that for a while. When you
feel like moving on after journaling, switch it out for something
else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A variation on the above is that rather than random pages you could
work through the book sequentially - read a few pages before journaling
until you find something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core of the foundational practice is that it needs a random
prompt to get you started, and those random prompts have to have a
reasonable amount of range, and a lot of flexibility for interpreting
them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another common way the journaling practice is likely to fail is that
you just stop doing it. Usually you forget to do it one day, and it
makes it easier to forget to do it the next, etc. The practice I
described above has a number of features designed to offset that:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a specific centre that is easy to return to (do your
foundational journaling before noon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes that centre easy to achieve (it uses a random prompt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has the candle as an anchor to help stabilise the practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly it has a physical book for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But these are all predicated on the fact that it’s relatively easy
for me to find time in the morning to do it, and I have a good physical
space for it. Your problems might be different.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core thing to do though is to decide:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When are you going to do your journaling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you going to do when you miss that slot?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are you going to do your journaling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you going to do if you’re not able to do it there? (e.g.
because traveling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For me the answers are:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally while I drink my morning coffee, but any time before noon is
fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as I can after noon I go do my journaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At my writing desk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ll bring my journal with me and try to do some journaling on the
right schedule, but it often won’t be my foundational practice because I
don’t have the tarot deck I’m using with me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h3 id="afterword"&gt;Afterword&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This excerpt was a good reminder that I should try to journal more
reliably again. I haven’t stopped doing it, but I probably average about
once a week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Partly this is because this daily writing project is taking up the
time slot that would otherwise be used for journalling.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cheeseburger Ethics</title>
    <updated>2024-01-17T10:50:05+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Cheeseburger Ethics&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-17&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another draft-amnesty post extracting a usable excerpt from an
attempted book length project, though lightly edited from the version in
draft. Originally based on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1557717189159010304"&gt;a
Twitter thread of mine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An important tool of ethical reasoning I use is the &lt;em&gt;cheeseburger
threshold&lt;/em&gt;: Asking whether an act is ethically better or worse than
eating a cheeseburger.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is useful because some bad things we do are bad like murder, and
some are bad like eating cheeseburgers, and the standards we hold those
different types of act to should be very different.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is not unlike the classic distinction between a
venial and a mortal sin, but I like making the distinction this way
better, both for the examples and because I’m not that interested in
whether your action counts as turning away from god.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The key distinguish factor is that something is murder-bad if the
ethically correct amount to do of it is zero, while it is
cheeseburger-bad if some amount of it is morally permissible and
incremental reductions are morally virtuous even if they don’t - and
aren’t intended to - get you to zero.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;There are of coure strict vegetarians who would hold
that eating a cheeseburger is as bad as murder, but even most
vegetarians who believe that the correct amount of cheeseburgers to eat
is zero will generally treat it as being in a different reference class
to murder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why cheeseburger-bad?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are clearly negative consequences to eating a cheeseburger -
the meat industry has many ethical problems, and even the most ethically
produced cheeseburger in which everyone in the pipeline was well paid,
all the animals were well treated, etc. has significant environmental
costs. Probably even if not vegetarian one should assign some ethical
significance to the life of the cows killed in making the cheeseburger
(both for the meat and for the cheese), and that too should be factored
in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But also cheeseburgers are convenient and delicious and widely
culturally accepted as permissible to eat and so, despite the harms, we
eat cheeseburgers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Possibly you’re vegetarian, or vegan, or hindu, or keep kosher. In
which case I encourage you to substitute your own similar badness act
for the cheeseburger. I like the cheeseburger example because the harms
are so clear - as much as we like to ignore them - and eating it is so
clearly culturally permitted. But you could consider, for example,
driving a car as another cheeseburger style act (environmental cost,
noise pollution, risk of injury to others, etc).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another cheeseburger-bad act might be pirating movies or TV shows.
It’s on its own a “victimless” crime if you wouldn’t otherwise have
bought the thing pirated (of course, it’s easy to convince yourself of
that. Would you really not have?). Certainly the harms of pirating a
digital good are relatively minor. And yet, in aggregate, piracy does
seem to cause a lot of harms, especially to independent authors,
publishers, and developers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I will continue to be using cheeseburgers as my example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The point is that cheeseburger-bad acts are things that we
acknowledge have harms, and that a maximally virtuous version of
yourself might choose to avoid cheeseburgers entirely. The current
version of you could, and possibly should, also choose to eat fewer
cheeseburgers, and we would acknowledge this as morally virtuous,
without requiring that you cut out on cheeseburgers entirely for it to
count.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the ethically correct amount of murder is zero. You do
not get points for saying “Yeah, I know murder is bad, I’m trying to cut
down”. Murder is bad enough that by the time “I’m trying to cut down” is
a consideration, you are already beyond the ethical pale.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although I’ve phrased it as a threshold for how bad an act is, using
this tool more a question of how (if at all) you can reform from
performing such an act.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think this may be a sign that I’m framing this wrong
tbh. “Is it as bad as eating a cheeseburger?” is a useful framing
question, but really what I’m talking about is something more like
categories of ethical acts. Commensurability of acts is part of it but
not all of it.&lt;/span&gt; A habitual murderer doesn’t need to
cut down, they need to change their very way of being. A habitual
cheeseburger-eater just needs to cut down.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is again a subject on which many vegetarians would
differ because they would in fact regard cheeseburger-eating as
requiring a fundamental reform of your character. I suggest again
replacing this with another example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think it’s very hard for sufficiently many cheeseburger-bad acts to
add up to murder-bad. Someone who eats cheeseburgers for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner, is rude to everyone he meets, drives loud gas
guzzling cars everywhere, and generally goes out of his way to do every
pettily immoral and inconsiderate act he can think of is still not doing
something murder-bad. The correct approach here is still to cut down,
and every step along the way to doing so is morally praiseworthy.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Although they may be enough of a jerk that you don’t
want to praise them. You can think of this instead as being
incrementally less morally blameworthy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, say, running a scam is murder-bad despite not being
nearly as bad as murder - you can’t think of reform from this as trying
to cut down on the scams you run, you need to become a person who does
not run scams.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why make this distinction?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The main reason is because it’s important to be able to acknowledge
that some things we do are bad without it being a big deal. Having a
class of actions which we acknowledge are bad but don’t consider
ourselves morally obliged to eliminate entirely allows us to make
incremental improvements, which has good effects. If we treated all
cheeseburger-bad things as murder-bad, this creates a very strong
incentive against recognising them as bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The cheeseburger example works very well here: Even from a strict
vegetarian’s point of view, it should be considered preferable for 100%
of people to cut out 90% of their meat consumption than for 50% of
people to go full vegetarian. Also, most people aren’t and are not going
to become vegetarian, and being able to view their actions as worth
reducing without having to&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Being able to acknowledge the harms of our own behaviour without
being overwhelmed with guilt allows us to take a proper reflective look
at our own behaviour and, where we decide it’s worth it, improve it, and
where we decide that’s too much work, helps put it in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Something isn’t working</title>
    <updated>2024-01-18T10:24:43+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Something isn’t working&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-18&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Loosely based on a stub chapter from the same work as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-16-13:11.html"&gt;Journaling
as a foundational practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core of my approach to a lot of things is embarrassingly simple:
If you’re getting outcomes you don’t like, that means something about
what you’re doing isn’t working, and you can fix that. A system is
perfectly designed to achieve the outcomes it achieves, so if you don’t
like the outcomes you have to change the system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is in direct contrast to &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/dont-just-try-harder"&gt;doubling
down on the thing you’re doing&lt;/a&gt; because if it isn’t working then
clearly the solution is to try harder, or to get mad about the fact that
it doesn’t work and conclude it must be some failure of yours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a running joke that when I do coaching, a great deal of the
value I add is to listen patiently and then say “Yes, that does sound
like a problem. Have you tried solving it?”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I very rarely literally say this, but I do often say variants of
this. “What have you tried?” is a common one. Often the answer is that
they’ve not tried anything. Sometimes they have tried many things, but
they haven’t worked.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“They” of course also often means “me”. Sometimes I need someone to
say “Have you tried solving the problem?” to me too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My approach to writing software isn’t that much different. I write
software. It’s software, so it has problems. I fix those problems. &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/03/what-the-fuck-are-we-doing/"&gt;Sometimes
I probably shouldn’t&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately this approach has produced very
good results that would otherwise seem impossible, just by fixing the
problem in front of me repeatedly and seeing what happens.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fixing things that aren’t working consists of trying to understand
them, based on that understanding trying to change something that you
think will help, and learning from what happens then - either its
success or its failure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ultimately this is a process of &lt;em&gt;debugging&lt;/em&gt;, and it feels very
much like debugging software, where you systematically narrow down what
causes a problem until it’s clear enough to fix.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Software and other &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/two-types-of-work"&gt;crunchy
work&lt;/a&gt; is very good for teaching this skill, because it provides you
with a very tight feedback loop that rewards systematically going
through everything. It’s a good type of work for learning &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-07-08:50.html"&gt;how to
be better at everything&lt;/a&gt; because of how much it rewards diligence.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is interesting contrast to my advice not to just
try harder, but I think they’re compatible. The unified advice is that
if you’re going to put in more work, don’t put it in by doing more of
the thing you’re currently doing, do it on things that you’re not doing
because they seem like too much work.&lt;/span&gt; A lot of these skills then transfer
reasonably well to other environments, as long as you’re prepared to
understand how crunchy work and squishy work differ. Nobody likes a
software developer who treats everything like a software problem, but
part of why that type is so common is that the basic attitude
&lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. Treat things as understandable, and fixable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For me in particular I use “debugging” as a concept a lot in
emotional contexts. e.g. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-20-17:58.html"&gt;How I
fix anxiety triggers&lt;/a&gt; is very much a debugging process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things to debug is when you get &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-give-good-advice"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt;
from other people and it doesn’t work for you. It might be that you’re
doing it wrong, but it might also be that the advice is not well suited
for you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1656631345165000704"&gt;said
before&lt;/a&gt; that the universal disclaimer of self-help books is “This
advice has a domain of applicability, and the author is not competent to
assess what it is”. i.e. This will help some people, but the author
doesn’t actually know who. This applies to all advice, really.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some (non-exhaustive) ways advice can fail to apply to you:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is some ideal middle ground, and this advice is designed for
people on the far side of that from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This advice relies on capabilities you lack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This advice solves something that’s not your bottleneck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But from a debugging point of view, this makes such advice actually
quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a book called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/1118539273"&gt;How
to measure anything&lt;/a&gt; that I am mostly&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think that there is a target audience for whom it is
very good, and I am not that target audience.&lt;/span&gt;
indifferent to, but that had a fundamental premise that has entirely
justified the read for me: A measurement is anything that reduces
uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this sense, everything you try while debugging is a measurement.
Either it solves the problem, in which case you’ve solved the problem
and also learned something, or it doesn’t and you’ve learned something
through how it fails. Use that measurement to find out more about the
problem. Everything you try is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-26-09:43.html"&gt;a
forking path&lt;/a&gt; that tells you something about the system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So here is my advice: Try more things, take more advice, but notice
as you do when something isn’t working, and then fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shared frustrations</title>
    <updated>2024-01-20T12:00:45+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Shared frustrations&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-20&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am, it will shock you to know, annoyingly finickity about things
being done correctly. It hurts me somewhere deep in my soul when people
do things in obviously suboptimal ways.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Importantly I’m fine with people doing things less well
because it’s easier. What annoys me is when people are obviously failing
&lt;em&gt;by their own standards&lt;/em&gt;, getting worse outcomes for a worse
experience of doing the thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I try to reign this in. I don’t actually like telling people off, so
I’ll often be silently frustrated rather than telling someone about
it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is a bad idea for anything recurring, because as a
result I sound super annoyed by minor things when I finally break and do
say something about it. I’m not saying I don’t do that, I’m just saying
I do that and I know it’s a bad idea. If you will, an obviously
suboptimal approach that is failing even by my own standards…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you two instances of this recently and something
interesting I learned from them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is this: We have an instant pot. Its pressure cooking mode
gets used for roughly two categoires of things: Making stock (usually
beef, sometimes chicken), and what you might think of as “normal
cooking” - stews, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Crucially, these take very different times. Stock takes about four
hours, normal cooking takes somewhere between 20 and 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Adjusting the time on an instant pot is very slow. This makes
switching between these two times irritating. Fortunately, the instant
pot has a feature for this: The pressure cooker remembers two previous
times, and you can press the pressure cook button to switch between
them. So you can have it remember a four hour time and a half hour time,
and everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At least, everything is fine if people use this feature and don’t set
both timers to four hours, forcing me to do the slow adjustment process
every time I used the normal cooking mode. Very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I did eventually explain this feature to the others in my house, and
of course neither of them knew about this feature - it’s not like they
would have been maliciously setting the timer wrong, and it’s a pretty
non obvious feature until you know about it, and I only found out about
it relatively recently. Problem solved. But I’d been vaguely annoyed
every time I used the instant pot for the entire several month period
between discovering this feature and telling people about it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;To be clear I don’t use the instant pot &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;
often, so we’re talking about maybe 3 or 4 times at most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More on this in a moment, but now let me tell you about another
kitchen irritation: Someone has been stacking the pots wrong. This means
that the cupboard doesn’t close properly because the pot stack is too
tall.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a specific stacking order to the pots. If you get it right,
the pot stack is short enough for everything to work fine. If you get it
wrong, they don’t nest and it’s too tall. Someone had been placing pots
in a non-nesting order, and this was causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Eventually we were in the kitchen together at the time when the pots
needed stacking, and I showed them how to do it. “Oh, that’s how you
stack them! I had no idea those nested, they look exactly the same size.
That’s been so annoying.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are two interesting things about this response:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were in fact correct, it was slightly non-obvious. The pots are
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exactly the same size, but they do look pretty similar from
the outside, it’s just that one has much thinner metal than the other so
although they look similar in size the slightly smaller one nests easily
in the slightly larger one, because the interior of the slightly larger
one is much larger relative to the slightly smaller one than their
exterior would suggest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’d been annoyed by this too, and I hadn’t shown them how to
solve their annoying problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This recontextualised some things for me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That instant pot thing? Adjusting the timer to four hours from half
an hour is just as annoying as adjusting the timer from four hours to
half an hour. I shared it as a “this is a thing you do that is annoying
to me and here is how to not do it” but in actual fact it was probably a
thing we &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; were finding frustrating, and that I could easily
have shared as “Hey you know that annoying thing? I’ve figured out the
solution!”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing about being annoyingly finickity is that because I care
about doing things right, and because I &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-18-10:00.html"&gt;debug
everything so reflexively&lt;/a&gt; is that “obviously suboptimal ways” is not
actually obvious to others. It’s obvious to me because I’ve &lt;em&gt;figured
it out&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes through careful problem solving and sometimes
because I accidentally pressed the button twice and noticed what
happened when I did.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I’ve done that, I can share this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The silly thing is that I’m actually very good at sharing knowledge a
lot of the time. I have a sort of habitual attitude of teaching when
people ask me for help. e.g. a great habit of mine that you should
definitely steal is that when people can’t find a link and I find it
using search, I give them both the link and also tell them how I found
it. This is a great way of helping people be better at search, which is
a surprisingly deep and hard to learn skill.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;The downside of this habit is that it sounds a bit too
“let me google that for you” if you’re not careful. I usually &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/telegraph-your-moves"&gt;telegraph&lt;/a&gt;
why I’m doing this quite carefully, and am very explicit that it’s not a
problem if they apologise for not googling for it themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I’m good at sharing information spontaneously - you’re
reading this on one of my outlets for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But volunteering information to someone specific, in response to
something that they’re doing wrong, feels different. Like I said, it
feels like telling them off, and I don’t like doing that. It feels bad
for me to do it, and I’m worried about people reacting badly to it. Most
people don’t like unsolicited advice. Not that I expect anything to go
terribly wrong from telling partners about minor things, but it might
hurt their feelings and I don’t actually like doing that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do think this fear is somewhat real - a lot of the time people
don’t like being told they’re doing it wrong, and often wrong is
subjective. Sometimes &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; wrong because the suboptimal way is
in fact optimising for some preference I don’t know about. I suspect
it’s exaggerated in my head, but it is a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I think a lot of the time, the fear is largely the result of a
skill issue on my part, and I need to stop thinking in terms of “argh
you’re doing it wrong” and more “boy it looks annoying to do it that
way. Can I show you a thing?” and see how people respond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developing new capacities</title>
    <updated>2024-01-20T12:44:36+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Developing new capacities&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-20&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a general phenomenon that I think of as “capacities” - your
ability to do things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A capacity can be anything. It can be a broad skill, it can be a
narrow trick that you know how to solve some particular problem with. It
can be a physical item. It can be someone you know who you can do the
thing for you. It can be some complex emergent combination of all of
these thigns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A capacity is not just that you can or can’t do the thing. It’s
&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you do the thing, and a crucial part is how easy it is for
you to do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A good illustration of this for me is cars. I’ve owned a car, for the
first time in my life, for a bit over a year. Previously, whenever I
needed a car I rented one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From a financial perspective, I’d probably still have spent less
money on my car if every time I used it over the last year I rented a
car instead. We’re getting to a point where it might be close, but I
think I’d still have spent about 50% less money.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In actual fact I’d have spent a lot less than that of course, because
most of the times I’ve used the car over that year I just wouldn’t have
bothered. It’s not just about the financial cost, it’s about the fact
that my car is literally right there and I can just get in and drive.
Renting a car adds a significant effort overhead that makes small
transactions not worth it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Yes, I’m aware of Zipcar and the like. In my experience
they’re exactly optimised for use cases I don’t have, and end up
strictly worse for almost anything I care about.&lt;/span&gt; In theory, owning the
car doesn’t make me able to do anything that renting a car wouldn’t, but
in practice the different effort levels involved make it a very
qualitatively different capacity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, as well as the cost and convenience, having the ability to
casually drive means I get better at driving because I do it more
regularly. This makes driving less stressful, so I’m more willing to do
it. Having the capacity teaches you to use the capacity, and thereby
enlarges it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I did know this prior to owning a car, but I probably still
undervalued it. The main thing I bought a car for was to be able to
drive to and from my parents’ house - it’s about an hour’s drive from me
by car, and essentially has no public transport options to get there in
under three hours.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;In actual fact, I would probably still just about be
ahead on cost if I’d taken a taxi to and from my parents’ every time
I’ve visited them since buying this car. It would come to maybe £200 for
the round trip, and I’ve probably visited them maybe 20 times since
then, which is only £4,000. But also many of the trips would not have
happened at this price tag - it’s easy to pop around for dinner on a
whim with a car, but that wouldn’t happen with a £200 price tag and the
need for advance planning that comes with a taxi.&lt;/span&gt; It was very much a response to a
particular problem I had.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But once you have a car, you can just use it for easy things. I use
it for shopping from time to time, I use it for moving big things. I can
bring a giant stack of firewood back from my parents’ place if I want,
which a taxi would side eye me on. I can pop over to the next town
easily.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I probably still underutilise the car to be honest. Part of this is
that I feel at some level I shouldn’t be driving too much (I think this
is true but that I’m probably overstating it). Part of this is just that
I’m still used to a mindset that I’ve had for most of my life, where I
don’t own a car and can’t do car things as a result.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This seems like something I should fix. The car is useful, and
expensive to maintain, so I might as well figure out how to make use of
it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a much more &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/why-is-it-hard-to-choose-what-to"&gt;proactive
mode&lt;/a&gt; than I often remember to deploy. I’m all about “That does seem
like a problem. Have you tried solving it?” but this is much more “That
does seem like a solution. Have you tried finding problems to solve with
it?”. It’s worth doing, I just don’t habitually do that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Importantly: I don’t know that I could have done it nearly so well
without owning a car and starting to recontextualise how useful they
are. Once you have the capacity and you figure out how to use it well,
you unlock a lot of hidden value that just thinking in terms of what
problems you already have that could be solved with it, because it
doesn’t just solve existing problems for you, it opens up things that
you don’t even think of as problems because it doesn’t occur to you that
you can do them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I’ve been thinking about this recently is that my income
has gone up a lot over the last year, and money is very much a capacity,
and I’ve been trying to figure out ways to deploy that capacity for life
improvement recently. It’s going pretty well. There are fairly modest
low hanging fruits available that you just don’t think about when money
is tight, and aren’t even that expensive once it’s loosened up a bit.
For example I paid for an ironing service recently, because I like
wearing collared shirts&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Although I haven’t actually started wearing them again
yet. Lost the habit and I’ve been busy.&lt;/span&gt; but hate ironing. It cost about £20
to get literally every shirt I own ironed. Not free by any means, but
very affordable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another capacity I’ve been working on that flows out of this recently
is that I realised that my household would very much benefit from some
additional help with admin, so we’ve hired a part-time PA&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;How did I find a PA? I posted on the local Facebook
group asking if anyone was available for such work. Another thing I
recently discovered existed, and thereby developed a capacity I
previously lacked.&lt;/span&gt; on
an experimental basis. We’ll basically give her odd jobs and pay her
weekly at a rate of £15/hour for however much work she’s done during
that week. This is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; early days experiment, so there
are loads of things that may or may not work about it, but I’m very
happy to have done it nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about this decision is that I don’t
really know what sort of tasks we’ll give her. The specific prompt was I
wanted someone to offload a search for a good cleaner to, but that’s
totally something I could do myself&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And has been totally something I could do myself for
months…&lt;/span&gt;. We’ve got a bunch of
other small tasks like that, but there’s a very real possibility that
we’ll just work through a TODO list and then by done.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think so. I think having someone like this to offload
tasks to is going to be a really good capacity to have, and I’m looking
forward to finding out ways to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drawing on resources</title>
    <updated>2024-01-21T10:24:34-08:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Drawing on resources&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-21&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Complementary to the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-20-12:01.html"&gt;capacities&lt;/a&gt;
view of things, another useful broad label is “resources”. Resources are
essentially anything you can draw on to do stuff. Possibly, though not
necessarily, in a consumable way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s some overlap between the two concepts of course, in that
every resource implies a capacity of stuff you can do by drawing on that
resource. e.g. I talked about money as a capacity, and money is
obviously also a resource.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the places I find this view most useful is creativity in
general, and writing in particular. When you are writing, you have
essentially all of your existing pool of experiences and knowledge as a
resource to draw on. All of the e.g. conversations you’ve had, books
you’ve read, idle thoughts you’ve had, things you’ve done, previous
material you’ve written, sit together in your head as a kind of pool of
inadequately articulated material that you can pull on and refine out
into something that you write about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of the view that creativity isn’t really something you
generate, but is instead a (skilled and difficult!) exploration of the
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-things-come-to-be-as-they-are"&gt;adjacent
possible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The resources available to you define your adjacent
possible because you draw on them to elaborate and combine them into new
material.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing that seems to be common with creative resources is that
they become stale. You see this with some authors who, for example, draw
on their professional experience and produce really good work, but the
more they become writers and the further divorced they are from that
professional experience, the more shallow their writing becomes. I liked
Lethain’s &lt;a href="https://lethain.com/writers-who-operate"&gt;writers who
operate&lt;/a&gt; as an expression of this problem. This was definitely part
of my concern with my consulting business too - I was a bit too far
removed from the professional experiences I was drawing on, and as a
result I’m appreciating going back into more senior IC level work. It
definitely feels like I have a much richer set of renewing experiences
to draw on now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You also see this thing in fiction. For example, hypothetically, you
might have a science fiction writer who is clearly drawing on his
experience as a software developer who has dealt with a lot of office
bullshit, but the longer he’s a science fiction writer the less relevant
any of that experience becomes. Hypothetically.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This also came up during the pandemic I think. I don’t know if you
noticed, but it feels like a lot of material that was written in
2020-2021 is a bit… flat. As if the day to day experience people were
drawing on as stimulus for their writing was no longer there. I might be
imagining this - it’s certainly at least partly a reflection of
&lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; mood during those times as anyone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One general strategy that I think is worth doing is to seek out
activities that cause you to generate new resources. For example, it’s
good to have regular conversations with people about the sorts of things
you might like to write about.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;A non-trivial number of my posts in general are sparked
by conversations on discord.&lt;/span&gt; I also use &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-16-13:11.html"&gt;journaling&lt;/a&gt;
as a place to generate half formed thoughts for drawing on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Landmarks</title>
    <updated>2024-01-22T08:10:54-08:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Landmarks&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-22&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of why I like solving problems so much is that they
serve as landmarks in the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a problem you don’t know how to solve, then solving it
necessarily involves learning something new.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That’s not a deep insight. It’s just what “don’t know how to solve”
means.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But the flipside of this is that the fact that you have the problem
means that you know something about that discovery: It has to solve the
problem, and you do understand the problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Discovery is about walking up to the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-26-09:00.html"&gt;edge
of the familiar&lt;/a&gt; and stepping over.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You start from where you are, and then you go to something new.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Normally, this is bewildering. You step out of familiar territory and
are in a bewildering landscape with a million directions you can go in,
and no clear way to choose between them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After all, if you knew where you were going then it wouldn’t be
unfamiliar territory.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But when you have a problem to solve, it gives you a clear sense of
direction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s as if you can see the shape of the solution towering in the
distance, telling you which to go: This way. Towards me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can evaluate your unfamiliar discoveries against your problem -
do they solve it? Do they help understand it? Do they at least do
something interesting with it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem does not, exactly, tell you which way to go. There will
be dead ends, there will be detours. The landscape of the unfamiliar is
mysterious and hard to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But you can tell if you’re getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People aren’t for any one simple thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But one of the things I’ve always known I am for is expanding the
boundaries of human understanding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’d like it to be in large ways. I certainly haven’t managed this
yet, but I have managed many small ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly content with that, but I am pleased that I have.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But one of the difficulties is knowing where to start, what to
do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The unfamiliar is vast, and “expand the boundaries of human
knowledge” isn’t exactly a clear mandate. How can you possibly pick a
direction? I don’t know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I of course know the answer, even if I haven’t always been good at
executing on it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because there’s a little voice in my head that when it hears the
question, answers thus:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes, that does sound like a problem, David. Have you tried solving
it?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I don’t wanna</title>
    <updated>2024-01-23T07:36:45-08:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;I don’t wanna&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-23&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular feeling that I think of as the “I don’t wanna”
feeling. It’s a kind of sluggish resentment, of the sort you get when
someone asks you to do something when you’re tired, or ill, or
hungover.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s the sort of feeling where &lt;a href="https://the-toast.net/2014/02/13/woman-has-to-do-the-same-shit-tomorrow/"&gt;Woman
Amazed And Horrified She Has To Just Keep Getting Up And Doing The Same
Shit Again Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; starts to become extremely relatable:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t an actual problem,” this woman tried to tell herself.
“The fact that I have to…do things to exist, that isn’t an actual
problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Which, oh God,” she realized, “means there’s no actual
solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I definitely find the frequency with which this feeling comes is a
depression sign. Feeling like this regularly and about regular things is
absolutely not a sign that you’re in a healthy emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s interesting to note the places that it comes up even
when I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; especially depressed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, it’s often the specific feeling underlying &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-cant-solve-procrastination"&gt;procrastination&lt;/a&gt;
for me. Especially on certain classes of task. e.g. I hate cleaning my
room. I’m aware this is childish.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And probably if I dig deep there’s some &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/parts-of-you-havent-grown-up-yet-004"&gt;child
part&lt;/a&gt; expressing some specificoutrage there&lt;/span&gt;. That’s often how “I
don’t wanna” feels.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But another more interesting place it comes up is tasks for which it
feels like this way &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;. Writer’s block is a very “I
don’t wanna” feeling for example.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I leave it as an exercise to the interested reader to
infer why I picked this particular topic to write about today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s often possible to work past this particular instance of “I don’t
wanna” with a sort of gentle self-coaxing, but it tends to be a bit like
pulling teeth, with every step along the way requiring a constant level
of coaxing. “You don’t have to do very much, just write a short piece”
or “If you can’t think of anything, why not use this prompt…?”. These
strategies work as long as I &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/believing-that-you-can-stop"&gt;believe
that you can stop&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Of course to a degree that promise is to some degree
fake. e.g. I really am going to write a notebook post every day
regardless of how I feel about it, and I’m not going to abandon a post
literally midway through, though I might cut it short.&lt;/span&gt; sometimes, but there’s a sort of low
bubbling resentment at being made to do the thing throughout the entire
experience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about the feeling of “I don’t wanna” is
that it very much comes with a feeling that the thing being requested is
&lt;em&gt;too hard&lt;/em&gt;, but this is clearly fake. You can tell it’s fake
because the internal response to making the thing easier is a sort of
“Fuck you”, and because a great deal more effort than the thing itself
would take is spent resisting it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Again, leading credence to the idea that it’s some sort
of child part.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think a more accurate reading of this “it’s too hard” feeling is “I
don’t wanna do the thing, so I’m going to &lt;em&gt;make sure&lt;/em&gt; that it’s
too hard to be worth it”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The feeling is also sortof recursively resistant to introspection.
The feeling that comes up when I try to introspect an “I don’t wanna” is
an “I don’t wanna!!”.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I probably don’t need to keep pointing out how extremely
literally this seems like interacting with a child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s interesting is how often the “I don’t wanna”
isn’t exactly wrong and is more of an “I’m not ready”. There have been
enough instances of having this sort of feeling on something - writing a
thing, fixing a bug, etc. where all I needed to do was sleep on it and
the next day was able to easily and fluently work on it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in the other direction waiting for the next day is
often actively unhelpful, because it can let the I don’t wanna feeling
really take hold and a long period of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html"&gt;drifting&lt;/a&gt;
can easily begin. That’s the sort of time when an I don’t wanna feeling
is secretly depression. I don’t think my model of depression as a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-19-10:53.html"&gt;consistent
bias towards inaction&lt;/a&gt; is the whole of the picture&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Especially because depression is multifaceted and this
is only one type of depression I’m talking about.&lt;/span&gt;,
but it does seem to keep rearing its head.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One place this feeling really comes up, no matter how depressed or
not I am at the moment, is anything that feels like it’s trying to
“force” creativity. If I’m in a creative mood, being creative is easy,
but it’s not like I stop being able to be creative when I’m not in the
mood - I understand creativity well enough that I have systems that
would absolutely let me do it if I could bring myself to use them when
blocked, but unfortunately most of the time I very much don’t wanna.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Layers of being bad at things</title>
    <updated>2024-01-25T06:00:45-08:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Layers of being bad at things&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-24&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about a very specific series of realisations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, an observation: I am bad at standing on one leg. Not awful,
just bad. I can do it, but not for long, and I wobble.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For most of my life I just thought of this as an intrinsic fact about
me. Not very good balance, bit uncoordinated, has flat feet, therefore
bad at standing on one leg. It’s only natural.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, it turns out that if I clench my core muscles and the glute
muscle of the leg I’m standing on, I instantly stabilise. I don’t
completely stop wobbling, but I go from very unstable to pretty stable,
with only a minor wobble.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn’t a me thing, that’s normal. Those are just the muscles you
use to stabilise that position, so if you want to stand on one leg you
need to engage them. But, apparently, if I just try to stand on one leg
I don’t engage them enough.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an &lt;a href="https://celandine13.livejournal.com/33599.html"&gt;errors vs bugs&lt;/a&gt;
thing. I’m not “bad at standing on one leg”. There is a specific defect
in how I’m trying to stand on one leg, where I’m not doing one of the
things required.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At some level I find this very counterintuitive. Aren’t muscles just
supposed to… do the thing? Like when I’m walking, I don’t think about
what muscles I’m using. And that’s not just because walking is easy. I
also don’t think about what muscles I’m using when I’m lifting something
heavy.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Though I bet some weight lifter reading this just winced
and went “Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; you’re supposed to pay attention to your
muscles when lifting, you idiot.”&lt;/span&gt; You just do the thing and the
muscles you need to do the thing automatically engage, right?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apparently not, though, at least not for me when it comes to standing
on one leg. Or with many other movements. I’ve been doing pilates
recently, and it’s remarkably easy to do almost the right movement while
using completely the wrong muscles to get the desired effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do expect that people who are good at standing on one leg just do
this automatically. There’s no conscious attention to those muscles,
they just do the thing. This is the unconscious competence stage of the
skill, and I’ve just entered the conscious incompetence stage of the
skill, where I’m still bad at it but I know why I’m bad at it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there’s another interesting layer to this: When I stand on one
leg this way it’s &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. I’m better at it, but I can’t
necessarily do it for much longer. The limitation is no longer my
balance, it’s pure muscle strength. Those muscles don’t like clenching
that way. I’m sure this is just a practice thing and is pointing at some
good exercises for me to be doing, but right now I’m weak in a way that
means that even knowing how to do this I’m not actually that much better
at it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is probably part of why I’m doing it wrong in the first place:
Doing it right feels much worse. Of course, this is a vicious cycle
where in doing it the “easy” way, I never learn to do it right, and as a
result it never becomes easier because I never develop the strength to
do it the right way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The solution to this is to practice &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-07-08:50.html"&gt;doing
things the hard way&lt;/a&gt;, but I think it’s important to notice something:
If I’d just practiced standing on one leg the way I was doing
previously, the results would have been mediocre at best, because the
way I was doing it was not engaging the right muscles and thus was not
something that would have developed strength over time. In order for it
to be useful to practice doing things the hard way, I first had to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-18-10:00.html"&gt;figure
out what it was that wasn’t working&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Noticing things as life happens</title>
    <updated>2024-01-25T19:45:00-08:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Noticing things as life happens&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-25&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was at an event recently where someone tried to kill me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m being a little overdramatic here. It wasn’t &lt;em&gt;personally&lt;/em&gt;
directed at me. Also I wouldn’t have died even if they had succeeded in
their attempt, it would just have ruined my day.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probably very few people indeed would have died from the specific
thing they did. Plenty would be hospitalised, certainly, and even among
those not hospitalised, many would have had a much much worse time than
I did.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But only slight variations on what they did could absolutely have
been fatal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am, of course, talking about the catering.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To be less vague, here’s what happened: I was having the pleasant
experience of looking around a buffet and seeing a lot of things I could
actually eat, all clearly labelled with allergens.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’d actually already eaten, so I didn’t get much, but I did wander
over to the desserts section. There there was a selection of delicious
looking creams. Unfortunately, I cannot eat delicious looking creams, as
they’re made mainly of wheat and dairy, my two big dietary nemeses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But! They had vegan cashew creams which, unlike their non-vegan
neighbours, were not listed as containing gluten. Hurrah, dessert for
me. I piled a small plate with them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I looked at them, and I looked at their gluten-containing
neighbours with a literally identical shell to the allegedly gluten free
ones I was holding, and a little voice in my head said “hmmmm. I have
doubts.”I queried with the staff, and they confirmed that yes in fact
the vegan cashew creams were, while vegan, not gluten free.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Side note: It’s an ongoing bugbear of mine that “vegan”
is often treated as maximally inclusive. Big fan of there being vegan
food for vegans, but it’s actually quite a lot harder to make vegan food
compatible with other dietary requirements and also still be good and
massively limits your options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I put down my plate, sulked away, and kicked up a fuss with
the event organisers. They, thankfully, took it very seriously, and
raised it with the vendor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there are a couple of interesting things about this
story.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is: This error is really really bad. The dish in question
listed allergens, and other dishes listed the allergen I was looking out
for, but this dish did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; list that allergen despite
containing it. This about the most dangerous possible way to be
unreliable with your allergen info, because it’s practically guaranteed
to create a false sense of security. Doing this is much worse than not
including allerrgen info at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As I say, I’m lucky in that my dietary problems just aren’t that bad.
I’d have had a bad day if I’d eaten these. People with celiac disease
would have had a much much worse time. And if someone had a really
severe allergy to an ingredient they’d done this on, they could have
died.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I do expect that anyone with that severe an allergy is
even more cautious than me and would have caught this, but I sure
wouldn’t want to count on that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is: Boy did I not take it seriously enough given that. I
should have stayed with the tray until it had a big sign saying
“contains wheat” on it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that I’d had a day of petty food annoyances at
this point. Nothing serious, just a mix of bad luck, oversights, and
mild inconsideration from various people. This sort of thing makes me
disproportionately annoyed, because an already stressful experience of
trying to navigate food is made more stressful, I’m extremely picky
about meal plans being disrupted, and I have to deal with all of this
while hangry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What this meant is that when this happened to me I went “Oh, another
bloody petty food annoyance. Fuck sake”. It was only when thinking about
it some more and reporting it to the event staff that it dawned on me
quite what a big deal this actually was.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing about this was that apparently it was
relatively common knowledge among the attendees that this vendor was not
trustworthy in this way. I was just left ignorant of that as a relative
newcomer. I don’t quite know what could have been done to communicate
that to me (especially as I hadn’t made a big deal of my dietary
requirements, which I usually don’t), so I don’t really blame anyone for
that, but it’s interesting context.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;It probably also means that the event was safer than it
seems due to the relative lack of people who could be affected.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yet another interesting thing is that I noticed this at all.
Visually, the shell of these creams wasn’t &lt;em&gt;blatantly&lt;/em&gt; wheat
based. It’s totally plausible they could have been made out of some sort
of gluten-free flour. Without the reference point of other similar
things that were clearly made of wheat, I could easily have fallen for
it. But there was that moment of looking from one to the other and
paying attention to a dawning suspicion that made it worth checking. I
think this would have been easy for me to overlook, but I didn’t.
Possibly this is because my bad food day had primed me for suspicion,
possibly this is just because this is the kind of discrepancy I look for
in the world.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But the final interesting thing is just how many interesting things
there are about this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something I’ve been thinking about recently is storytelling. My
ability to write fiction is often a really good barometer of my mental
health.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Pay no attention to how long it’s been since I’ve
written any fiction. I’m fine! Fine, I tell you!&lt;/span&gt; I think it’s partly because in order
to write fiction I have to be able to tackle questions like… what sort
of life is worth paying attention to? Like sure I could write some sort
of &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/psychology-of-litrpg"&gt;trash
litrpg&lt;/a&gt; but I probably couldn’t because the whole point of litrpg for
me is disengagement, and story telling requires you to engage with the
lives of the characters.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which uh, requires engaging with life at all, and as you may be
picking up a certain vibe from recent&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And not so recent. I keep looking at random notebook
posts and finding posts from years ago about depression that are
annoyingly relatable.&lt;/span&gt; I’m a bit depressed at
the moment, which makes that difficult. Mostly what I want is stuff to
hyperfocus on so I can ignore all… this (gestures broadly).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was rereading this old post of mine about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-03-14:16.html"&gt;relearning
curiosity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;On the subject of old posts about depression…&lt;/span&gt; and it strikes me that the precursor
to curiosity is &lt;em&gt;finding things interesting&lt;/em&gt;, and cultivating the
skill of doing that and applying it broadly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And, depressed or not, I’m actually quite good at finding interesting
things. It’s the same skill as the one that let me spot the secretly
wheaty cashew creams, or &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-24-22:09.html"&gt;write
a post about standing on one leg and generalisable lessons from
that&lt;/a&gt;. You look at stuff, you notice how it fits in with other
things, and you notice how it doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the foundational realisations that set me on my current path
is this: You’re allowed to find your own problems interesting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this perhaps doesn’t go far enough. You’re allowed to find
&lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your life interesting, whether it has problems in it or
not. Paying attention to what happens and engaging with it is probably
very important, and learning to tell interesting (to you) stories about
what happens in it is probably a really important tool.&lt;/p&gt;
