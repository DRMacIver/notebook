&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Relearning curiosity&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-03&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apparently when I start a daily writing practice in which I am honest about my feelings partly as a way to work myself out of a depressed period,
everything I write is very sad. So, here we are again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A while back I wrote &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-28-15:58.html"&gt;I'm not actually that curious&lt;/a&gt;. I explained that although I am a voracious reader and know a lot of stuff, it wasn't actually generally powered by a learn things for its own sake - I learn in aid of things I want to do, not primarily because I want to learn. Almost everything I learn has a goal in mind. I don't seek out knowledge because I'm curious, I seek it out because knowledge is useful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dear past me: You realise that's bad, right? Well, in case you don't realise that (I'm not sure you did), FYI that's bad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's also not how I used to be. I &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; used to be curious, and just read about things because they were fun and interesting. I had a very nerdy notion of fun and interesting which means that this ended up me taking a book about classical mechanics (I still know a surprising amount about Lagrangian formulations of Newtonian physics, although it's all got a bit rusty) as my summer vacation reading when I was 16, but it was absolutely something I picked because I wanted to learn about it and not because I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My degree was in pure mathematics, which I certainly didn't get into because I had applications in mind for the connection between the axioms of set theory and questions in analysis (this was what my final year essay was on. It wasn't very good).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Apparently as a kid I would fairly regularly give adults mostly-correct lectures on various subjects I'd been learning about. Palm trees and black holes seem to be the topic that people tell stories about me doing this, but I'm sure there are others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At some point this got lost. I don't really know when, or why.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It feels like part of the problem is agency. As a kid it's easy to be curious about things, because nothing you do actually matters, and also you're mostly bored out of your mind. So why not learn new things purely because they're interesting and you want to stuff your brain with knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, you're a child, and thus you're still full of energy. The fatigue of ageing and the burnout of life haven't set in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Not that those are inevitable. My parents seem like they still have way more energy than I do)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now it feels like I've got such limited brain capacity and energy and such a greater degree of agency that &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; I spend it on useful things, because I feel guilty about not doing so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Except I think even as I write it that that's a cope. If that were the case I'd probably be doing far more useful things than I do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Really the core problem is that &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia"&gt;it's hard to care about things&lt;/a&gt;, and usefulness is a crutch.
It's much easier to solve a problem, which is obviously good. It's even better if &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-02-12:34.html"&gt;it's somebody else's problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I keep wanting to frame this in terms of justification, but I don't think that's quite right. The problem isn't that I feel like I have to be able to justify my actions to someone, but that they need to feel somehow purposeful. It's not that someone will attack me for doing it, it's that if I spend energy on something purposeless a huge wave of "What's the point?" rises up and I get distracted and go do something else.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Often it starts before that and I can't even generate the "purposeless" actvitity in the first place. I try to generate a plan for what to do and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-02-08:53.html"&gt;my brain glitches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is depression, of course. It's well-managed reasonably high functioning depression, but it's still depression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think of depression as a constriction of the felt world of possibilities. A narrowing of the actions that you feel able to take. A lot of my incessant "curiousity" in the search of the useful feels like I'm trying to squeeze a vast level of interest in the world through the narrow passages that depression has left me. What comes out is still pretty good, because I'm clever and competent, but it's fairly anemic compared to what I'd be doing if less depressed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of this focus on usefulness feels not so much like I'm motivated to be useful (I am, but it's more of a "make the pain go away" motivation than something I necessarily care deeply about), but that it's something to do while I'm here. I've got all these capabilities, there are things I can do that help make things better, might as well. It's slightly less fundamentally unsatisfying than wasting my day scrolling Twitter and reading YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; fundamentally care about helping people, but it's all swallowed up by the general meh. Certainly I would &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to be positively motivated towards helping people instead of it being something that hurts if I don't do it, but these days I'm struggling to be positively motivated about much of anything very serious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1476967194101698561"&gt;I wrote on Twitter about how incredibly mind-numbingly bored I am of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and that I really need more in person contact with people than I'm getting. That feels like part of this but I don't know how much of it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The absence of curiousity feels in some way like a primary thing in its own right that I should take seriously just as much as the absence of people.
Learning things should be a joyful activity, and the fact that it's not is a huge sign.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of my working theories of how to work with depression is to be constantly exploring the edge of the depression comfort zone - do things that you feel &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; too depressed to do. If depression comes from a restriction of what feels safe, exploring the boundaries of where you feel safe helps you relearn those as safe and then you can expand gradually outwards.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this even works.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, that's too cynical. It often works, it's just a bit of a two steps forward one step back process. The depression comes back, but it's easier to claw your way out of it the next time because you believe you can do that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So the starting point for solving the curiousity problem is something like asking how I would behave if I were as curious as I'd like to be, and walking in that direction until I hit the edge of the comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The obvious thing is that I would learn things just for interest. For some reason the example that comes to mind here is physics youtube. I've been enjoying &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SteveMould"&gt;Steve Mould's YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; recently for example. I really respect the urge to just go "How does that work?" and put in the effort to find the answer. I definitely used to have some of that, and I'd like to have it again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The other thing that comes to mind is that I'd talk to people more about things I find interesting. I really don't do this very much - these days all my writing is about stuff that's useful (in some very generalised sense of the term), which is a shame in and of itself - but really I have in person conversations in mind. Generally I just let other people take the lead, and feel very inhibited in proposing conversation topics and just going on about them, and that feels necessary if rather daunting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Who knows if any of this will actually work, but it feels worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Being a brain at night</title>
    <updated>2022-01-04T16:24:29+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Being a brain at night&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-04&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Look, I think we can just take it as read that the slightly traumatised writing will continue for a while. It's useful for me to write, and it seems to be useful for other people to read, so I'm going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I've been having panic attacks at night recently. Not every night, but maybe about once a week, and the edge is there on other nights.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sounds more dramatic than it is. They're not full blown panic attacks. Not really. It's very easy to stop them, all I have to do is open my eyes and distract myself.
It's not an irrecoverable panic attack, it's just that I close my eyes, try to sleep, and am filled with a formless dread as if I'm drowning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the most likely cause, as well as generally having been in a terrible mood due to general depression and the whole global pandemic thing, is that I'm getting to experience something that I have rarely experienced in my adult life: It's bedtime and I'm not caffeine withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I quit coffee about a month ago. As the joke goes: Quitting is easy, I've done it loads of times. This time I think it might stick. I've had a few coffees since quitting, all rather small, and frankly it's been awful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Among other reasons it's been awful because it seems by far the easiest way to trigger this problem. I don't need coffee to get a panic attack at night, but I get them 100% of the time I've had coffee in the last few weeks. As far as commitment devices go to break a habit it's a bit extreme, but it's hopefully effective.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(If this seems at odds with the claim that the problem is about not being caffeine withdrawn, the reason is that my caffeine tolerance is now mostly reset so although there's still less caffeine in my system by night, there are no withdrawal symptoms because I don't have the dependency, and what caffeine is still there is much more effective)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think when people hear you can't sleep because of anxiety they imagine that it's because of racing thoughts. Lying there awake thinking about all the terrible things that might happen, the things you did wrong, reminders of all your obligations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is not like that. It's almost the opposite. It's an absence of thought, coupled with a feeling that something is terribly wrong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Have you ever read Flowers for Algernon?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm planning to reread it soon, to see if I can exorcise some demons, but every time I remember the book exists I flinch. I don't know if it's meant to be a horror story but, for me, it is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am, like most smart people, probably over identified with my intelligence. I'm sure there are all sorts of reasons why I shouldn't be, and I do try to braoden out, but honestly I have no idea how to be me without my intelligence. It is pretty close to being a core feature of who I am - it's not all I do is think, but my thoughts are so central to what I do that a dramatic loss of intelligence would fundamentally change who I am. Flowers for Algernon's account of intelligence slipping away was extremely hard for me to handle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I am, naturally, similarly viscerally afraid of Alzheimers. Alzheimers is much scarier than dying to me, and I very much understand Terry Pratchett's support for assisted suicide)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What makes this particularly tricky to deal with is how much I experience my brain as a collection of black boxes. I've described the process of writing before as just reaching for the place where words come from and then letting it do its thing. What happens when the place where words come from goes away?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway this is what seems to be happening to me at night right now. I think this is likely to be perfectly normal tiredness and not something to worry about - it's normal to have trouble thinking when tired - but in the moment it sure doesn't &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like nothing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of the context for this is that when trying to fall asleep I often tell myself stories. Not particularly good ones, the goal isn't to craft a masterwork, it's just to construct some narrative to hang my thoughts on - often more worldbuilding than pure story. The current one is about a magical research team working on trying to improve a kingdom's crop yields, if you're curious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On nights when the panic occurs, this very much doesn't work, and is likely to be a trigger. The problem is that I reach for the place where words come from and they're... not quite absent, but sluggish, and blocked.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's like a sudden feeling of claustrophobia, when you're trapped and can't move properly - someone's lying on top of you, you're tangled in the duvet, some situation where you know intellectually that everything is fine and you're safe but oh god you have to move &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and if you can't you very rapidly get frantic. That, but the things I can't move are my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This probably shouldn't be scary. I suspect this is just what sleep is - the gradual disintegration of your mind as it shuts down for the night - and maybe all that's happening is that I'm more acutely aware of it now. But regardless of whether I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be afraid of it, the fear response is fairly primal. I've always considered "Do you die each night and a new person takes your place in the morning?" to be an annoying piece of philosophical pedantry with no real content, but apparently some part of me very much disagrees.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first night this happened I stayed awake until 9AM until some combination of exhaustion and coincidence allowed me to figure out my first workaround, which is to just watch Slay the Spire videos on YouTube as I fall asleep. It gives me something to focus on that isn't the contents of my own mind. It works as a backstop, although it doesn't result in good sleep and it takes a while - last night I had to put on a second one because the first finished and I still wasn't asleep. On the plus side at least that was two hours not spent panicking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some degree of meditation practice works reasonably well for the less bad nights - I've succeeded a few times at falling asleep counting breaths. When it works it works very well, but I think I need to be quite tired for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm also going to be trying some sleeping pills (just drowsy antihistamines to start) to see if I can just clobber the problem by being sleepy enough - this is how my old solution of running out of caffeine at night and thus being super sleepy worked after all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, taken as a practical problem, I'm getting on top of the sleep thing. It's annoying but manageable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But it's also just so &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;. There's clearly something going on here that I don't understand, and that I struggle to understand because in the moment that it's happening, most of the tools I use to understand things are offline.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ready for less than you think</title>
    <updated>2022-01-05T19:33:07+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Ready for less than you think&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-05&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I had to go to the hospital earlier. This wasn't a big deal, I just needed an X-ray on my knee, which has been giving me a hard time for a few months. I set up an appointment with my GP late last month, expecting it to take a while to get the referral sorted (this is incorrect, the NHS is actually very good at prompt X-ray referrals, but I always forget this because I rarely get X-rays and they're rather less prompt at many referrals on other things), so I'd have time for Omicron to settle down and have my knee looked when it was sensible and safe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I got a call this morning at around 8:33. I was not at all awake at 8:33. I'd had another &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html"&gt;night of bad sleep&lt;/a&gt;, and my alarm had gone off at 8:30 and so I was &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; conscious, but it was very confusing when my phone made a noise from the other room as if someone were uncouth enough to actually want to speak to me on it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The person on the other end told me that they'd had an urgent X-ray referral from my GP (I'm not sure it was really urgent if I'm honest) and could I come to Charing Cross Hospital for 10:25?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My response was slightly more articulate than "Huh? What? Zzzz" but not vastly more. Eventually my brain kicked into gear and I said I didn't think I could physically make it in time even if I left right that minute. Fortunately I checked Google Maps and determined that Charing Cross Hospital was not in fact anywhere near Charing Cross, but was in fact near Hammersmith, which is much easier for me to get to, and I determined that it would be tight but doable. So I said yes, I could do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A very rapid shower and a COVID test later, and a hurried message asking my partner to be in my flat to meet the Ocado delivery that was supposed to be arriving at 11, I dashed out the door to the bus stop.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first problem I encountered was that after having promised me a very straightforward route, Google maps was now telling me that it was literally impossible to get there by public transport. It does that. The Google maps app sometimes believes my area (which is very well appointed with bus routes and not too bad to walk to various more civilised forms of public transport) is just utterly inaccessible to public transport, despite generally being OK on desktop web. I opened it on my phone's browser instead and it confirmed that yes the single direct bus to Hammersmith was still a perfectly viable option despite the app's lies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second problem was that I missed my bus. This wasn't a huge deal, as it wasn't &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; tight and there was another one in 7 minutes, but as I was wondering whether it would make sense to get a taxi there I noticed my third problem: My phone was on 13% battery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It shouldn't have been. I'd charged it overnight. When I got home I found out that the charger had partly fallen out of the power socket, so although the cable was connected to the phone this wasn't a problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This also shouldn't have been a problem. I basically &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; travel without an external battery for my phone. But I couldn't find it when I was leaving, I was in a hurry, and figured it was fine - my phone was fully charged (oops) and I was only going to be out for a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I turned my phone off in order to conserve power, got the bus, and happily read Robertson Davies writing about interpersonal drama between Canadian academics for half an hour or so until I got to Hammersmith.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then I got off the bus, turned on my phone, and prepared to walk the last 5-10 minutes from Hammersmith to Charing Cross Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This should be easy, it's just a straight line from Hammersmith, more or less. I mean &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/dir/Hammersmith+Station,+London+W6+7AE/Charing+Cross+Hospital,+Fulham+Palace+Rd,+London+W6+8RF/@51.489909,-0.2257482,16.62z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x48760fb7e0b0070d:0x2398b7d670685535!2m2!1d-0.2248261!2d51.493483!1m5!1m1!1s0x48760fbbc7f7ed75:0x6cd065c43bb8bbf5!2m2!1d-0.2195543!2d51.4868889!3e2"&gt;look at this&lt;/a&gt;, it's not a complicated route.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Just one problem: Figuring out &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; straight line it is is impossibly confusing, because when your phone is in low power mode Google Maps becomes all but useless at telling you where you are, and Google Maps has always been useless at orienting without GPS in the UK because it insists on displaying road numbers instead of names. I don't want to know that this is the fucking A315, Google, I want to know &lt;em&gt;what the name on the road sign is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think I could have figured it out in about five minutes of wandering around the junction and staring (in retrospect, I knew which way North was, and if I'd oriented Google maps right I could have known I needed to head southish, and that would have been enough). Unfortunately I got about three minutes, which was how long my phone took to eat through the remaining 13% of battery. I don't know why it died so fast and should probably look into that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It took me about 25 minutes to find Charing Cross Hospital. I asked five different people for directions in the course of that. They were all very nice about it - I do charming but flustered polite Englishman very well and it tends to work for getting strangers to help you out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They were not, reliably, useful. Some of their directions were straight up wrong, some of them were in retrospect right but I failed to follow them correctly. The result was a lot of doubling back on myself. But I did find it before my appointment, though not as much before my appointment as they want you to be. I was tired, stressed, and had done enough running at that point (mostly to catch the bus, the rest was a brisk walk) that I'd probably aggravated the knee problem I was there to get checked.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway the X-ray all went fine, nothing to report there for now. They did make me do a rather uncomfortable lunge to get the knee right before the X-ray machine, which I'm probably going to pay for given that it's exactly the sort of motion that triggers the knee problem, but so far it's no worse than grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the knee isn't really the point of this story (to the degree that there's a point rather than me just feeling like telling you about how my day went).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of this has me thinking about preparedness, and the way it decays. This whole episode would have gone much better prior to the pandemic, because I would not have made the mistake with my phone - maybe it wouldn't have been charged, but I'd have had the battery. I'd have been less flustered by Google maps's problems because I'd have Citymapper installed (my phone is a bit low on space and I'm not actually travelling far right now so I uninstalled it).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, leaving the house involves a certain amount of skill and preparations. If you're travelling regularly, those are all fresh. If you're not, your skills have got rusty and your habits have been decayed - the battery that you always have access to has gotten tucked somewhere weird because you haven't used it recently for example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Navigation was also like this to a degree - I'd utterly lost the skill. When I mentioned asking for directions, J said "Wow, asking for directions? What is this the 90s??" and it's true - I've had a smart phone on me for 11 years at this point. The idea of being lost is just alien. Asking for directions was fine, but following them from memory sure was hard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It feels ridiculous to be bad at leaving the house in this way (finding it difficult to leave the house is less confusing, but successfully leaving the house and being bad at it is weird), because this is something that seems trivial and I've spent so long being competent at that it's part of my internalised self image that it's just something I can do at a moment's notice without it going wrong (a small achievement, but not an automatic one - I know many people who can't leave the house without forgetting something for example), but it's fairly natural, just not internalised.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking about how long it's going to take for being in a crowd to feel normal again, even once it's safe, but I think maybe one of the interesting things is going to happen before that, as we gradually resume life and find out all the skills and habits we'd taken for granted have to be relearned from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Drifting away the time&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-06&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the ways my &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-03-14:16.html"&gt;current difficulty with motivation&lt;/a&gt; plays out is that I spend a lot of my day drifting.
Left to my own devices my day probably won't be &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; drifting, but I might spend an hour or so on something I'd actually endorse as worthwhile. One of the reasons why daily writing is good for me is that it claws back another hour or so from the drift. This is, presumably, also why I sometimes find it hard to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Drifting is like... evil flow. It absorbs the totality of your being in the same way, but you're left feeling entirely unnourished by it. 
Flow is what happens when you're able to absorb yourself entirely in the achievement of some end. Drifting is what happens when absorbing yourself entirely &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the end, a way to dissociate from the world. Drifting is &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/first-hard-choice"&gt;eating the lotus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For me drifting tends to be spending time on Twitter, or watching youtube, it might be reading truly execrable Royal Road quality fiction, or if there's a new TV series to binge I might lose a day doing that.
It probably &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; playing games. The games I play tend not to be drifting games, because I've learned the hard way just how bad they are for me and in a rare case of being sensible about this I avoid drifting games. This is why I don't play Cookie Clickers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Slay the Spire is interesting in that it can be either drifting or flow - at low ascensions you can absolutely play it as a drifting game, but if you do that at high ascensions you die to Gremlin Nob. All of my Slay the Spire drifting time seems to have been adequately satisfied by watching other people play it on YouTube though)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of my time is spent in this drifting state - not really doing anything useful, but also not following any sort of interesting direction. This is why I don't really feel like it's right to characterise my relationship with curiousity as only being able to do useful things: It doesn't seem to be based in a strong desire to be useful. Idly following my curiosity in whatever direction brings me joy would be significantly more useful than most of how I spend my days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But apparently that's not what I want to do. What I want to do is drift.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Except, that's not quite right. It's not that I want to drift - the idea almost feels contradictory. It's more that drifting is an easy state to fall into. Not drifting requires active effort, and I don't want to spend that effort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;None of these are endorsed preferences of course. I want to want to spend that effort, and ideally I want to want to spend it on fun things as well as useful things. But in the moment what I apparently choose, most of the time, is drifting instead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The aversion to effort does feel like a key part of it. It's not an aversion to things I think I "should" be doing exactly - going for a walk or cooking a nice meal are equally prone to being avoided as reading and writing are. But they seem like too much work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There seem to be two distinct triggers for this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unable to generate the worthwhile activity in the first place. Making it easy to generate good activities seems to help a bit here. For example having habits around good quality reading seem to result in more of that. Having a daily writing habit makes it easier for writing to feel salient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unable to stick to the worthwhile activity - I start writing, or doing something useful, and then I reach a point where it feels unbearable to maintain my focus on this for any longer and I check Twitter or otherwise take a break "briefly" and often it's not so brief. This is particularly prone for things that I very much don't want to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The trigger for this does often seem to be unpleasant feelings come up when trying to focus and falling back to drift. I'd like to think I was good at dealing with unpleasant feelings, but the reality is that I'm probably quite bad at it. I think it's also telling that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html"&gt;the thing I often need to do to get to sleep right now&lt;/a&gt; is to deliberately induce a drifting state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Internally the urge to drift feels like I'm "too tired" to do things, but this seems to be fake, or rather it's not tiredness in that sense. Probably it's a Freeze reaction of some sort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason I don't think it's real tiredness is how much of this goes away as soon as soon as there are other people involved. Often I'll spend an entire morning drifting, and then get on a call with someone and be absolutely fine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This of course tends to result in people thinking I'm in a much better state than I actually am a lot of the time, because I'm fine when interacting with them and stop being fine as soon as I stop interacting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It doesn't even have to really be &lt;em&gt;interacting&lt;/em&gt; with the other person. On Monday a friend and I got on a call together as a way of motivating each other to get things done, turned off our microphones for an hour, and then checked back in at the end of the call. In that call I did all of the accounting and tax admin I'd been putting off for months (and learned I had about £800 of unpaid invoices. Turns out checking whether people have paid you is good). Normally this is maximally aversive task that would &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; have resulted in me losing track of myself about 5 minutes in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something like this also often happens with tweeting. I say Twitter is drifting, but that's not quite right. Writing on Twitter is often flow, or at least interesting and worthwhile. What happens sometimes is that I'm drifting and then suddenly there are Thoughts! which have to be expressed, I coalesce into a person for about 10 minutes and hop on Twitter to express them. But then I'm done, and I dissociate again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What's really drifting is checking Twitter, especially my notifications. People often describe this as waiting for the dopamine hit, but it doesn't really feel like a reward, it's more that I'm waiting for something to happen, and until then my brain is in idle mode. Thinking at the speed of likes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How bad this is comes and goes. December was the worst for this, but probably that's partly because I was ill a lot on December. Right now it's moderately bad, but feels like it's letting up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It never really goes away though unless I have some project I'm able to obsessively work on, which is a state that rarely lasts more than weeks, or I have people to work with (or at least in the company of). Conveniently both of those are 2022 goals, so this problem may be solved as a byproduct of that, but I sure wish I had a clearer idea of why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Writing as yourself</title>
    <updated>2022-01-07T16:49:01+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Writing as yourself&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a simple method to doing anything. Do you know it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be the sort of person who can do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How do you become the sort of person who can do the thing?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, if you're not already, first you need to be the sort of person who can become the sort of person who can do the thing, then you become the sort of person who can do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't an infinite regress. It's just the fully general system for learning to do hard things - eventually you bottom out by finding something that is only just outside your comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You might, of course, find that some of the steps are impossible, or that the chain of dependencies are too long. I'm not going to win an olympic gold medal - some step in that chain of dependencies there is a "become the sort of person who can..." which I won't be able to fulfill. I'm not going to learn to speak fluent Russian - I could, for sure, but it's hard work with many many steps, and I don't want to. I said this method was &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;, I didn't say it was &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Even claiming it's simple is a lie. It may or may not be simple depending on how complex each of those steps is)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this isn't really about skill development.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tautologically, every successful attempt to do the thing works like this: If you do the thing, you're the sort of person who can do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you can't do the thing, you're not the sort of person who can do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Sometimes you "can" do the thing you just don't want to. But if you can't overcome your lack of desire to do the thing enough to do the thing, can you really do it?)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So suppose you want to do something and can't. This gives you two options:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change who you are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do something that you can do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first sounds very dramatic, but it's not. Everything changes who you are. You might be the sort of person who can do the thing on a good night's sleep but not the sort of person who can do the thing when tired. So the way to do the thing is to make sure you've got a good night's sleep. Or have a coffee. Or do it on a call with a friend who can help you. Or... You get the picture. Who you are is as much a function of context as any intrinsic aspect of character.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also change in more fundamental ways. You can learn new skills, introspect on your emotional relationship with the thing, make any number of changes that improve your ability to do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But sometimes changing who you are is the wrong thing to do. Sometimes you're just doing the wrong thing. You've picked something that your soul rebels at the idea of doing, and the reason you can't do it is that you don't want to be the sort of person who can do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How to do murder: First become the sort of person who can do murder. Probably best... not, right?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think many things that we think of as immoral but where it's hard to articulate why they're bad are bad for this reason: Even if the thing itself is harmless, you first have to become the sort of person who can do them. Harmless in the moment, but corrosive to the character (I'm thinking of things like Jonathan Haidt's examples of "objectively harmless" thought experiments which people still think of as immoral - the most memorably graphic example of which involves buying a chicken from the supermarket to have sex with).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this isn't really about that either.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, as the title promises, about writing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people who say they would like to write, but aren't writing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why aren't they writing?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, Ira Glass has this notion of "the gap":&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What you are trying to do is write something that satisfies your taste, but you're not yet or currently the kind of person who can do that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You're also not the kind of person who can write things that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; satisfy your taste, because if you write something bad you feel bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, you don't write.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's more to it than that though. Even experienced writers get writers block.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Know what writer's block is? It's trying to write the wrong thing for you right now. You're not currently someone who can write the thing you're trying to write. You need to change who you are, or you need to write something different.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Often this can be done just by writing - slowly chipping away at the problem, incrementally reshaping yourself and the work to bring the two into alignment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Creative processes are very susceptible to being the wrong person, because often you're trying to express something deeply felt, and it's hard to fake that. It's tough to write sad songs when you're happy, it's hard to write upbeat practical pieces about fixing things when you're incredibly depressed and everything feels unfixable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But often there's something else you could be writing about instead. Whoever you are right now almost certainly has something you want to express, so why not write about it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result will often not be what you expect, it will often not be very good, but it will feel important in ways that much other writing you do will not, and it will often resonate with other people in a way a more polished piece cannot, because it captures something true.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grappling with vastness</title>
    <updated>2022-01-08T10:33:33+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Grappling with vastness&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-08&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It turns out I've written about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html"&gt;drifting&lt;/a&gt; before, albeit obliquely, in &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/why-is-it-hard-to-choose-what-to"&gt;Why is it hard to choose what to do?&lt;/a&gt; where I talked about the difference between proactive and reactive work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason why I’m interested in this split is that I’ve found that how proactive I’m able to be is a pretty reliable predictor of my mental health. On a bad day, the ability to be proactive goes long before the ability to be competently reactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I often find myself having days where if you dropped me in a coaching call I would be perfectly alert and useful and able to do a decent job, and between calls I get nothing done1 - I check Twitter, or I watch YouTube, play a game, or maybe (probably not) I go for a walk or do some cleaning or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way this feels internally is that I’m perfectly able to do things, but what I’m unable to do is generate things to do. This is unfortunate, as in theory I have lots of free time and the ability to do quite interesting things, but often they don’t get done anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That is, on a bad mental health day, faced with the requirement to choose what to do, I drift.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Rereading this piece makes the difference between my newsletter and my current notebook writing fairly clear I think. It's a very intellectual approach to the problem - it's not that I don't talk about the feelings involved, but even there it speculates about them in a very detached way that I'm not sure is entirely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/The_Lagrangian/status/1478122278307041280"&gt;Adam puts it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what if your cognitivist problems like "akrasia" and "low executive function" are actually emotional problems like "this scares me" or "i don't actually care"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I noted that drifting feels a lot like a freeze response ("I'm too tired to do anything" is a common feeling leading to drifting), and, well, maybe it is. Maybe I encounter the vastness of free choice available to me and Freeze in response to it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to see little versions of this sort of response.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I do with my life?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I do today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I write today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I write on my notebook today?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I write on my notebook today about what I've been thinking about recently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you move down the list the possibilities become more constrained, until it becomes narrower and more tractable.
Towards the beginning of the list, you have to confront the vastness, and that's scary.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem isn't just that you have to make a choice from within infinite possibilities. It's that you have to grapple with your agency over those choices, and confront your lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I started writing about how the problem was infinite freedom and some part of me rebelled, because it's not, is it? In fact there is very little freedom right now, and dealing with "What should I do today?" causes me to confront that head on, let alone "What should I do with my life?". Given free choice over what to do today I'd probably try to hang out with a group of friends in person, but even in the before times that's hard to organise on short notice, and right now it's all but impossible (or at least feels like a bad idea).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Choosing smaller problems allows me to grapple with things that are my size, and that I know I can handle, but as I expand the scope, I have to grapple with a world of possibilities that is vastly larger than me, and could easily crush me as and when it fights back, and honestly, yeah, this scares me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Memory and yearning</title>
    <updated>2022-01-09T11:03:17+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Memory and yearning&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-09&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm told normal people remember their childhood. I don't, not really.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At least I say I don't. The memory is clearly there a lot of the time, but it's not always very salient. It takes digging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know how other people experience memory. I often hear things like "Counter to what you might expect, memory is not recalling a snapshot of what happened from an archive, but is instead a story you reconstruct from pieces" and this sentence sounds a bit like "Counter to what you might expect, water is not a burning sea of flames, but is in fact wet".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Does memory really feel like you're recalling what it was like to be there for you? It certainly doesn't for me. It's more like a puzzle hunt.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm good at remembering facts. Very good. I probably have better access to my mathematics degree 15 years later than most people do after 5.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's because facts fit together. If you don't remember the fact you want, you at least remember something like it. Then you can chain it along - following links of associations until you find the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can do the same thing in a conversation - my superpower is that when you ask "Wait why are we here at this point talking about this thing?" I can generally replay exactly the link of topics that got us here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Memory of events sometimes works like that, but particularly with childhood stuff it all feels like a jumble. There's no organising principle I can follow for most of it - I can construct a timeline, more or less, based on where I lived when, major events, that sort of thing, but when I come to fill in the details it's often a blur.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Adulthood isn't &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better, but it's more recent and thus more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even when I try to sort through the fragments it feels more like an experience report. "Yeah, that happened". There's no real feelings attached to it for the most part. Sometimes the me that is remembering has feelings about it, but trying to recreate how I felt at the time is just a guessing game - the information isn't there as far as I can tell. It's just a list of facts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Or at least that's what I tell myself. It doesn't seem likely that it's true though.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things I've been noticing recently is that some things that remind me of childhood make me sad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not the things you'd necessarily expect - a lot of things about my childhood sucked (mostly school), but remembering those there's a certain distance from them and most of what I feel about them is rage. At the time I was probably miserable, but these days thinking about it just makes me want to burn the system down.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's the first time I noticed it recently, and you'll laugh: Watching the premiere of the new Wheel of Time series.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear. There's nothing about the Wheel of Time that should inspire deep emotion, either the books or the TV adaptation. But they were a big part of my childhood - I must have started reading them when I was about eight (this is really too young to have started reading them, but oh well), picking up The Eye of the World in an airport bookstore en route back to Saudi from the UK, and was an avid fan for a while. The books definitely got worse over time, but I kept reading them as long as Robert Jordan kept writing them. Book five in particular (sadly one of the not very good ones) got me through a particularly difficult period where I had nothing else with me to read and needed to hide from an unpleasant situation. I must have read that book at least four times. Unfortunately nothing actually happens in it, so I didn't get much from the experience except a reprieve.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(This is what I mean when I say that my memory is clearly better than I pretend it is. It's not actually hard for me to recall this information, I just treat it as hard).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I found myself on the verge of tears during episode one. No real risk of actual crying, but definitely that feeling around the eyes as if you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; tear up if you just leant into it. I'm not very good at leaning into it, honestly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know how much other people get this, but it's like when the orchestral score for a movie is &lt;em&gt;clearly&lt;/em&gt; trying to manipulate your feelings to make you more moved by a scene than it actually warrants and it works dammit. You know there's nothing there, but the shadow of the emotion falls over you anyway and you can feel the edge of the tears there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I noticed it again recently watching the YouTube channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BREADSWORD/videos"&gt;BREADSWORD&lt;/a&gt;, and their video about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=428ZxrW6jhk"&gt;Disney's Robin Hood&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing terribly sad there, although something about their general presentation often triggers a bit of this for me (I think it's that they always seem at least slightly sad themselves), but that movie was definitely something I watched multiple times as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Neither of these are particularly explicable. I'm not sad &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; something, I'm just sad. There's clearly some emotional association they're triggering that leads to sadness, but the feeling isn't revealing anything about what that assocation is. Maybe it's just latching on to some remembered sense of being a kid, and it seems pretty plausible that as a kid I was sad a lot of the time (although I'm not sure I would have expressed it that way).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It feels like maybe the idea that I don't remember feelings from the past is also a lie I tell myself, and that I'm just dissociating from them, holding them at arm's length because they're too much to deal with, so they have to find other ways to sneak around the censor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Last night talking with L I mentioned that I have a long standing "minor" yearning (pro tip: If a yearning keeps coming back to you over and over again over a period of many years, it's not actually minor even if you're pretending it is) for stars. It feels like I never get to see the stars any more. If you look at the sky in London, you'll see almost nothing. There are too many lights everywhere even if there aren't clouds (and there are often clouds). Even outside of London, light pollution is everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This got me to talking a little bit about when I'd really have properly got to see the stars in the past, and my childhood experience of this is camping in the desert. We did this a lot as a family. I don't, if I'm honest, have very fond memories of it - I was not a particularly active kid that I can remember, and being in the desert involves being hot, sandy, far from any shower, and on the look out for scorpions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But the stars must have been glorious. The desert sky has no clouds to speak of, and you're far from any sources of light.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know I must have looked up at them, but I don't really remember. This is one of the other problems with my memory - I have almost no ability to visualise, and so almost no visual memory.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Honestly I might not have even been able to see the stars. I don't remember when I got glasses, but I spent a lot of my childhood unable to see things properly until someone realised that maybe I needed glasses (I had no idea that the world wasn't supposed to be blurry) but I'm not sure when that was. I know it was in the UK, when a friend of the family noticed that I was squinting and handed me her glasses to try on and I went "oh huh so &lt;em&gt;that's&lt;/em&gt; what a tree looks like?", but it must have been before we'd moved here permanently.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But either way, I think the desert is where my yearning for stars comes from, and I find that thinking about the desert very much taps in to this well of sadness that things like remembering favourite childhood media merely sips from. I don't know what it is, but something about trying to remember the desert properly brought me to tears while writing this. Couldn't tell you a thing about why, but it wasn't a subtle effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of my working with feelings has very much started with thoughts and concrete problems. I've taken the feelings seriously, but always in relation to the thing they were about, and so this sort of feeling without an obvious target isn't something I really know how to work with, and childhood memories seem to be something I actively ignore, so never think to work with. As a result, there's clearly a lot there that I've been pretending isn't, and should probably try to figure out how to connect with.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Being unreliable</title>
    <updated>2022-01-10T15:52:30+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Being unreliable&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-10&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the worst things about me is that I'm fairly unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Much of it is for reasons beyond my control. It always feels like an exaggeration to describe myself as "chronically ill", but I am on a literal reading of the phrase chronically ill. I get ill a lot. I spent all of December ill, more or less, between one virus or another. Started out with what was either a mild flu or a really bad cold, extended it with a fairly strong reaction to my COVID booster, and then kept daisy chaining new viruses on top of that, getting a new one each time I was feeling better from the last one. It sucked.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then there are the days where I just wake up feeling terrible for no obvious reason and it doesn't let up. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1480595949671964674"&gt;Apparently based on polling on Twitter this is not uncommon&lt;/a&gt; which is, I guess... not exactly a relief, but misery loves company. It's certainly concerning that the numbers are that large.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html"&gt;recent major sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; are also adding to this of course - sometimes I wake up and I've not had nearly enough sleep. Even before that my quality of sleep is highly variable. I used to think of this as a "sleep problem" in that I woke up feeling terrible and attributed that to a result of sleep, and it lingered, but I'm no longer totally sure this is the case. It certainly could be (e.g. one candidate cause is mouth breathing at night).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sort of day to day unreliability makes it very visible to me how bad most work arrangements are for people who can't manage to reliably show up every day for a job. I'm not quite that bad in that I can &lt;em&gt;show up&lt;/em&gt;, but my level of function on a given day may not be meaningfully different from if I didn't. Fortunately I'm good enough at my job that most of my employers have never really noticed - I can just about fake function in a meeting, and my work on the good days tends to be more than enough to make up for the rest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is kinda what I mean by it feeling like an exaggeration to say I'm chronically ill. People with more severe chronic illnesses often can't clear that bar, or need more accommodation. Nevertheless, it sucks and I don't like it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this isn't really intended to be complaining about my health, though maybe I should write about that as well some time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of the basis of my unreliability seems more emotional in nature. Maybe some of the emotions are underwritten by the physical unreliability, I don't know.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm also really unreliable for things at longer time scales. It's very hard for me to commit to things over a long period of time, because over time they acquire this massive... ugh isn't quite right. It's not that they're aversive, it's that the very idea of them feels exhausting.
I've had a few things that haven't gone this way - for example I have managed to maintain a writing habit over a period of decades - but writing feels like more of a skill than a project. I have this problem just as badly with writing projects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is also, in large part, while I failed to complete my PhD. It hit the point where I just couldn't bear to work on it, so I didn't.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It also shows up on a day to day basis - I make a vague plan to do things and then never follow through. I set intentions to e.g. have a habit of cleaning regularly, and don't. A lot of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html"&gt;drifting&lt;/a&gt; happens when there are plenty of things that I could be doing that past-me intended to do and I intend future-me to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm aware this is yet another post that will cause people to say "David, you have ADHD" but I really don't think so. I'm certainly somewhat in that direction, but the assessment tests think I don't meet the threshold, and stimulants don't seem to help this problem all that much. Also my internal experience doesn't feel like it's all that much like people with ADHD describe theirs as.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was going to claim that I don't feel wracked with guilt over this, and I guess this is true, but there's definitely a certain undercurrent of shame to this, and especially to talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In particular the way we treat reliability as a moral responsibility really adds to that. I do, largely, endorse that. I would like to be reliable, both for myself and other people, and think I would be a better person if I could be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One way of doing that is not trying and just having better support structures. Being more reliable is definitely one of the things I most &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-02-12:34.html"&gt;want help&lt;/a&gt; on, but I have no idea how other people can help me on this. Working in a company does that to some degree, but going and working for someone else increasingly doesn't feel like the right fit. Definitely one of my fantasies for once my current business takes off in a big way (hopefully a when not an if) is having a PA to help keep me organised, but that only really scratches the surface of the problem - really I need collaborators. I'm not going to stay remotely on task for as long as I'd like to on a big project without some external assistance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is something I feel like there should be pre-existing structures for. Or at least it's something I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; there to be pre-existing structures for me to slot into. Maybe there are, maybe I just slipped through the cracks, but I don't think so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The smart but unreliable person is pretty common, and we're very useful if you can give us the right support, but it increasingly feels taboo to even think about providing that support, let alone asking for it. You're supposed to be reliable on your own, and aren't entitled to anyone else's help in being so. How are you supposed to learn to be reliable if you're not automatically? Well, figuring that out is your responsibility too. Tough luck if you can't manage it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In many ways this would be easier if it were ADHD. As well as being potentially manageable with medication (though truthfully I'm pretty reluctant to consider medication for my problems that feel like they have an emotional underpinning. No judgement to anyone else who does, this just feels like the wrong solution for me), ADHD gives you more of a social license to ask for accommodations - it's not my fault, I have ADHD, so you have to take that into account. Whether people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; take it into account is another story, but in principle the option is there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't really know that I want accommodations anyway. I don't think of the things I want as accommodations - accommodations are things you give people to help them fit into a place in the world that is fundamentally not designed for them. Often this is much better than the alternative, which is that you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; help them fit in and just let them suffer, but it's not ideal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Really what I want is some mix of figuring out the underlying issues, both health and emotions, that allow me to be more reliable, and build a part of the world that fits me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Being fragmented</title>
    <updated>2022-01-11T05:57:21+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Being fragmented&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-11&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Being human is weird and I don't really get it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This may be surprising to you, or it may not, given I've probably spilled most of a million words writing about it, but really that's how that works. People aren't good at explaining things they understand easily.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But a lot of that is about being a human among other humans. This is, admittedly, what being human is, and you can't really separate the human condition from the experience of other humans, but nevertheless there's something about the basic n=1 human experience that I feel like I don't get some times.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A while ago I asked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1085634803381297152"&gt;if people experienced themselves as their body or their body as something they pilot&lt;/a&gt;. I've gotten better at experiencing my body as me since I asked that (though I'm still not perfect at it by any means), but the thing that's increasingly hard is experiencing my brain as me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sounds bad, maybe it is. It's not that I think my brain is anyone else. All of the bits I have ready access to feel like they're doing fine, but it feels like there's so much going on that I don't have access to, and it's very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can't tell how much this is just me and how much is just the human condition. Sometimes when I don't understand something fundamental like this it's because I'm missing something that other people get, but I think a lot of the time other people are also confused about it when it's pointed out them and just ignore it most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But it feels like there's clearly a lot going on under the surface. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-09-10:00.html"&gt;My relationship with memory is very confusing&lt;/a&gt; and there's clearly a lot going on there that I don't have direct access to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not totally clear to me whether I should &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; to be able to directly access these things. All of it feels a bit mysterious. It may well be like feelings, where you have to essentially use something else to "bridge" the parts of your brain that aren't talking to each other directly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing that sometimes works as bridging is some sort of talk aloud protocol. Writing is, in theory, similar but I think doesn't work as well. Hearing yourself speak and noticing what comes out is often a surprisingly good means of finding out things about yourself. If only it didn't feel so weird to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting a little bit, on and off, with &lt;a href="https://photographyinsider.info/image-streaming-for-photographers/"&gt;image streaming&lt;/a&gt; as a way to learn visualisation. I've had precisely zero success with this method, precisely because speaking out loud seems to be hard for me in a way that disrupts the process. I've had a little more progress with doing the things they say don't work, just paying attention to vague visual impressions I have while half asleep in bed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My working theory about visualisation is that it's basically a user interface to some sort of underlying capability, and I'm definitely not completely lacking that underlying capability, but it feels like I'm communicating with it in semaphore. e.g. I've got a pretty good spatial memory, and there's definitely &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; I can do that is like mentally walking around in a place that I have lived for a while. Or even just spent a reasonable amount of time. There's even a bit of a somatic component to it - I have an experience as if walking around in the place. I could no more really tell you what I'm doing than I could tell you how I left my hand up. I just do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I'm obviously not walking around in the space. It's more like the equivalent of an inner monologue - there's no confusing it for sound, and yet it has a sound like quality. This is what I assume (and have somewhat confirmed) visualisation is like for most people too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there's clearly still some of the things that visualisation is supposed to access going on. I can, e.g. describe what someone looks like from memory. It just doesn't go via an imagine appearing in my head. &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt; is providing the information, in whatever form, I just don't have access to it as anything other than a black box feeding me information.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, all the capabilities of my mind feel fragmented. Like there are different pieces talking to each other, but large chunks fail to participate in any sort of unitary whole. This isn't plurality - I don't feel like multiple people occupying the same space - it's more like I'm a person with a computer, and some of the capabilities of the human-person computer reside in the computer which the person has to type commands into.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sounds dramatic, but I'm pretty sure some degree of this is normal. Being human is weird, and the more you look at it the weirder it gets, so most people don't look at it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which is fine. It's mostly unproblematic as long as everything is working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But often not everything is working. When tired, or ill, or half-asleep, capabilities stop working or become slow to respond. It feels like it's unsurprising that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html"&gt;I sometimes panic at night&lt;/a&gt; - the capabilities I rely on to function as me are disrupted, and the fragmented nature of thought starts showing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coffee as a way of life</title>
    <updated>2022-01-12T00:46:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Coffee as a way of life&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-12&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Right now I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want a coffee, and I shouldn't have one, so I'm compromising with a green tea. But this daily writing is about whatever is on my mind, and apparently coffee is what's on my mind today, so let's talk about coffee.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back in early December I got the flu. It wasn't much fun, and I spent a couple of days basically unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, I took the opportunity to break my caffeine addiction. This made it even less fun, but past a certain intensity it doesn't really matter if it gets a bit worse because I'm basically asleep and full of cocodamol either way.
I had a coffee break scheduled for the week after anyway, so it wasn't bad timing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been a coffee addict for about 20 years at this point - started when I went to university, and have continued ever since.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People look at you funny when you describe it that way. For some reason people don't think that the drug they take every day in order to feel normal is a real addiction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Pact coffee, who I use(d) for coffee deliveries sent me this email after I started writing this post, and clearly know exactly what they're doing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You took a break from fresh coffee deliveries a while ago. I just wanted to check whether you're stocked up, or it it's time to unpause your plan? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're ready for your next hit of the good stuff, just hit 'Unpause my Plan' below, or you can log in to your Pact Account Page to unpause your Plan whenever you need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People's responses when you tell them that you're quitting coffee are often absolutely infuriating. "Why would you ever want to quit?" is common - apparently the fact that they literally can't conceive of life without their drug of choice is evidence that it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a big deal...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Most users also skip their daily drug dose so rarely that it doesn't even occur to them that the withdrawal symptoms are related. My dad has a story about how he used to get these really mysterious headaches every weekend and he couldn't figure out what was up with them, until he eventually realised that maybe the large quantities of strong coffee he drunk at the office might have something to do with it...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The best piece of advice I've given to people talking to me about this is to imagine I'm saying "cigarettes" instead of "coffee" as a sanity check for whether what they're saying is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, quitting coffee is hard, because you end up building your whole day around it. The first priority in the morning is dealing with caffeine withdrawal (if you wake up feeling like shit every morning, sorry that's probably caffeine withdrawal), which drags you out of bed to make coffee. You drink your coffee, and now you need to go to the bathroom (coffee keeps you regular, although how pronounced this effect is depends on the type of coffee). Now you've got lots of energy (although not necessarily the good kind) and can get on with your day. This gradually wanes throughout the course of the day until by night time you've run out of caffeine, feel sleepy, and fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Or at least that's how it is for me. Others differ.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Quitting coffee I have... none of that. This causes all sorts of problems. For example, since quitting I've been &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; struggling to get out of bed in the morning because the cue I've been using has been the caffeine withdrawal, and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html"&gt;my current sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; seem to partly stem from not being sleepy enough at night due to the lack of caffeine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general it feels like the loss of caffeine has destabilised my entire way of being in the world. I'm much less agitated and fidgetty, which is one of the key reasons why I wanted to quit it, but it turns out I used a lot of that agitated fidgetiness as the basis of getting things done. One of the benefits of the daily writing this month is that it solidly proves to me that I can write without caffeine which is honestly not something I entirely believe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is all of this worth it? Honestly, I don't know. I like not feeling like shit in the morning, and not spending my day either wired, sleepy, or both, is pretty neat. I can read hard nonfiction in the evenings now because my brain hasn't run out of caffeine to fuel it, which is also neat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I have really bad days and I desperately want a coffee because I think, often correctly, that it will help. And this isn't ideal because when my caffeine tolerance is low, caffeine is a hell of a drug (it's about 4 hours since I started writing this post as I had some calls in the middle, and I'm still buzzing off that green tea and a little worried that I won't be able to sleep tonight). Caffeine really helps me plaster over variance, and is one of the tools I've used to be &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-10-10:41.html"&gt;slightly more reliable&lt;/a&gt; over the years. Also it's very easy for one bad day to lead to another, especially if the caffeine I used to fix the first disrupts my sleep, and before long I've got a caffeine addiction again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More than this though, it just feels like being a bit of a stranger to myself. There's the version of David that I was on caffeine, and there's the version I am now, and they're not miles away from each other but they're different enough that the whole thing feels disorienting. It feels like a healthier place to start from, but it also feels like I'm having to relearn basic things. Nothing about my day or my emotions works quite like I expect, because there are subtle shifts in how everything works - the rhythms of my day are different, and the mood I bring to tasks is different. It feels like I'm having to relearn a lot of things from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a pretty decent chance I fall off the wagon and go back to being caffeine David. It's not like this is the first time I've tried to quit coffee, and they usually fail - in my most successful attempts I get a couple months in and go "Wait am I just going to be this depressed forever? That sucks." and go back to drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I'd like to stick with it this time. I like different things about caffeinated and decaffeinated David, but the latter seems like a better foundation for deciding who I want to be, even if I have to learn a lot of the basics of being him from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
