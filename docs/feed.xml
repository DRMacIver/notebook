&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Learning and teaching&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As far as the fox vs hedgehog split goes, I'm thoroughly on the fox side. Nevertheless, I often find it interesting to think about what my big idea would be if I had a big idea.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The one &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1380094274373611521"&gt;I've suggested before&lt;/a&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a problem, you should look into what people who have had similar problems do, and learn from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is the right idea, but maybe it goes deeper than that. It's something more like... the skilled practice of learning from each other underpins everything.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I think most people are shockingly bad at it. It's mostly not their fault, we don't give people the opportunity to be good at it, and we don't teach them to be good at it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think it starts not with being bad at learning from others, but with being bad at helping others learn. If you're in an environment where there are very few good learning opportunities, such as a school, you've got very few chances to actually learn to learn, because you essentially start on hard mode. Skill development requires you to try to learn things that are &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; outside of your comfort zone, and most of us aren't so much thrown into the deep end as set to paddle with the sharks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One reason why why we're bad at it is that the things that we most need to learn afrom each other are ones that it's very hard to talk about. The piece of mine that is currently going aggressively viral, &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/people-dont-work-as-much-as-you-think"&gt;People don't work as much as you think&lt;/a&gt; is not particularly good - I dashed it out in about an hour while half asleep - but it is &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; valuable to (some) people because I'm telling them things that nobody else has. People tend not to talk about this publicly because they're ashamed, embarrassed, or scared to do so, and so a valuable learning opportunity is lost, and everyone is left needlessly in the dark and stressed out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that most things are just very badly explained. &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/"&gt;I don't think explanation is that hard&lt;/a&gt;, but most people never really learn to do this. They assume concepts the other person doesn't have, they fail to use examples, they forget what they're trying to explain. It's all easy to do if you've not practiced explanation. They're also often wrong - there's the classic problem that if you ask someone who never had to explicitly learn a social norm works (e.g. because they grew up with it and are neurotypical), they'll probably give you a helpful, clear, and utterly wrong explanation because that's not how their knowledge of it works.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The combination results in a fairly hostile environment for learning, and I think most people go around confused about major aspects of their lives. Certainly I'm sure I do (I have in the past, and I have no reason to believe I have recently figured out the final pieces).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What's the solution? Well, sadly there probably isn't a singular and straightforward one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can read more, and I encourage it, both books and people on the internet. You can watch other people on YouTube, TikTok, etc. In general I'd recommend learning from people with more niche followings - the big names are (or can be) worth listening to, but people who have similar experiences to you and have learned a different piece of how to navigate them are where the really useful information is at.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's also worth learning to communicate better, and I think the best possible place to start with that for this problem is to explain your own experiences. Be the person who has similar experiences for others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of people writing more openly and honestly about their lives like I've been doing recently. Maybe under a pseudonym or a Twitter alt, but telling people about the problems you face helps them realise it's not just them, and when they respond or &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-26-19:35.html"&gt;when they pay it forward&lt;/a&gt; and talk about something else, maybe you'll get to realise it's not just you either, and you can compare notes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As well as writing in public, I'm a big fan of private one-on-one communication with trusted friends. Talk about your problems with your friends, learn from them, and generally try to figure out the world together. Maybe eventually we'll start to make sense of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ladders between communities</title>
    <updated>2022-01-30T17:15:21+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Ladders between communities&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today I had to do something that if you had asked me to do it a few years ago, I would probably have faked my death and run away to a foreign country.
Specifically, I had to tell someone that they hadn't broken any rules, but we were collectively finding their presence extremely unpleasant, and they should leave now.
I did chicken out and use the communal we, and I had gathered some basic consensus first, but it was ultimately my decision.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't think the person I asked to leave was a bad person. At worst clumsy and clueless. But I think that letting him stay would have made the community drastically worse, and I'm glad I've become a person who can make this kind of call, especially as I've seen multiple communities fail through not making similar calls. If you've got someone who dominates a community and everyone else finds vaguely unpleasant, the community gradually drifts away unless you can foreground the conflict. Unless a community has some central organising shared purpose and resources, which many modern communities lack, it's very hard to hold it together.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of this is conflict aversion in the community members. I don't think this is a universal at all, it's a function of my particular demographic of weird vaguely traumatised nerds who can't handle social conflict. It's not &lt;em&gt;unique&lt;/em&gt; to us by any stretch, but I think we have this at a lower threshold. The same dynamic that allows people to behave badly without modifying their behaviour also tends to be the community members being conflict averse enough to find their presence too unpleasant to endure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear: I don't think the person I kicked out was a bad person. For my part, they seemed mostly fine. I didn't enjoy their presence either but I'd have been fine to put with it, and I expect on a one-on-one basis I'd have had a perfectly reasonable conversation with them and everything would have been fine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I do think leaving them in would have wrecked our community, which is why I took action. I hope they find a community better suited to them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is, fundamentally, that their presence makes the rest of the community unable to function. It was, for lack of a better term, a failure of culture fit. The gap between how they expected to behave in a community and the way the community needs to function was too large - we didn't think they were able to learn to be one of us, and we didn't think we would be able to be us if they didn't.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Communities are like this. I've got into a big fight in the past because someone was trying to argue that communities should have clear and transparent purposes and anyone aligned with that purpose should be welcome. This is, bluntly, a fucking terrible idea, and can only be held by someone who has never run or experienced a functioning community. Communities have to function first and foremost as communities, and this requires either a certain level of cultural and interpersonal alignment, or they fail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've talked in the past about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-31-09:20.html"&gt;Norms of Excellence&lt;/a&gt;, and I try to run my discord broadly on these principles, but I think this incident demonstrates something missing: One of the most important norms of excellence is being able to say "I'm sorry, this is not the community for you". Excellence is sought among people with enough shared context and similar problems and skills to help each other out, and having to constantly include people who are absolutely not ready for that doesn't help those people while also wrecking your current ability to progress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I still hope those other people find their own communities of excellence, and this makes it even more important to figure out how to build such communities, because a small number of communities can't really support a wide variety of people. At least, not without subdividing those communities and essentially forming a community of communities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a term of art I use, "communities of last resort", which basically means communities that will take anyone as long as they can put up with the community. I have in mind places like 4chan, and some of the other forums of that ilk. They're not good places, but for people who need a community of people who understand them, they're often the only option, and they're often surprisingly valuable. I definitely know people for whom 4chan was a positive and formative experience, and many others even more so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think what we often need is ladders out of these communities, and people who are from communities in "the next level up" to help people out. Less Wrong has served as this for a lot of people - many people find Less Wrong hugely life improving, partly because they come from a 4chan or Something Awful background, and this is the next community up from that for them and is willing to both tolerate their initial undersocialisation and help them improve their life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There isn't really a strict hierarchy of communities like the ladder metaphor imples - often there are multiple communities where membership in either doesn't imply you're ready to be in the other - but I think the most important part of it is that when someone isn't ready to be in a community, there should be other communities to help them be ready.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course there often... aren't. The very idea seems impossibly utopian, with our current paucity of communities and lack of explicit support for this sort of personal development. But I can dream.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Soul death</title>
    <updated>2022-03-29T20:14:03+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Soul death&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-31&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Slight content warning: If internal family systems and other parts work is load bearing for you, and if I am right, there is a small possibility that this post contains information that will make your life actively worse, especially in the short term while you integrate it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's probably fine, and I'm currently hoping that this thought process is helpful (as I certainly can't unthink it), this is just a heads up. Proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/the_wilderless/status/1456619189171638276"&gt;let me show you a hilarious tweet from the_wilderless&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFS people: how do I hunt this part down, slaughter it, and leave its carcass as an example to the others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The tweet itself is funny, but what's really funny about the tweet is the number of people in the replies clearly failing to recognise that it's a joke, and sounding really quite distressed about the very suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Yes I'm laughing at distressed people, several of whom are my friends. I shall nevertheless regard the part of me that is a dick with unconditional love and compassion)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of this reaction is much more funny-interesting than funny-ha-ha. This tweet is &lt;em&gt;obviously&lt;/em&gt; a joke, right? And yet people don't get this. It's not that they're responding to it as if it was a bad joke, they're responding to it as if it was not a joke at all. That's interesting, right?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I like Johnathan Morreall's theories of humour, from his book Comic Relief, in which he describes the characteristic features of humour as:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic pattern [of humour] is that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We experience a cognitive shift – a rapid change in our perceptions or thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are in a play mode rather than a serious mode, disengaged from conceptual and practical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of responding to the cognitive shift with shock, confusion, puzzlement, fear, anger, or other negative emotions, we enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our pleasure at the cognitive shift is expressed in laughter, which signals to others that they can relax and play too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the book he discusses False Alarm laughter:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see what might have been involved in this disengaged mental processing, and how it might have benefited early humans, imagine the following scenario. A band of early humans is walking across the savanna, when they spot a lion in the clearing ahead. They freeze in their tracks for a moment, but then they see that the lion is feasting on a zebra and doesn’t even look up at them. With the sudden realization that the lion is not a threat, they laugh, signaling to each other “We’re safe. We can enjoy this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Humour requires something like this realisation: "We're safe. We can enjoy this."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So perhaps something about the wilderless's joke makes these respondents feel unsafe. That's interesting, right?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Consider another fictitious scenario. Suppose someone who you distrust and know could really genuinely hurt you makes a "joke" about hurting you. Do you think you would be able to interpret it as anything other than a threat?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I propose one possible explanation for why people reacted so badly to this tweet: They contain two parts, one of which would absolutely hunt down the other, slaughter it, and leave its carcass as an example to the others, and the other part very much knows this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A core principle of IFS and other parts work is that you can't actually murder parts. You can treat them badly, you can suppress them, you can ignore them, but you don't actually have the ability to cut off a part of yourself and kill it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is even true, but I can't help but notice that it's a very convenient belief to hold. Without it, doing IFS is like doing group therapy for a bunch of people all of whom are openly carrying firearms, and several of them are looking mighty twitchy. With it, the therapy environment isn't exactly &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt;, but it's boundedly dangerous. You can hurt each other with angry words and feelings, but you're ultimately all in this together and stuck with each other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As soon as the possibility of soul murder, where one part of you kills another, is on the table, it becomes very hard to create an environment in which healing is possible. You have to be able to tell parts that they are safe, and it is much easier to tell a part that it is &lt;em&gt;intrinsically&lt;/em&gt; safe because you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; kill it, than it is to convince it that you could absolutely kill it if you wanted to and also some part of you wants to and also you won't because you love it honest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is particularly true with &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-11-12-10:11.html"&gt;the sort of part I've previously described as a prisoner&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's the problem with this: Not all parts of you that are kept away from the world are exiles, some of them are prisoners, and they hate you, and they have every right to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distinction between an exile and a prisoner is this: An exile keeps apart from the world out of fear, a prisoner is kept apart from the world out of shame. A protector would let the exile out if the exile wanted to come out, a guard knows the prisoner wants to come out, that's the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prisoner corresponds much more closely to the Jungian model of shadows: You have rejected a part of yourself, and locked it in the darkness, where it has become monstrous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But really, it's not a monster at all, you've just done it a great injustice by imprisoning it, and it hates you for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Can you possibly trust someone who is armed, dangerous, and has previously harmed you that they're not going to use their power and murder you?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note that all of this is true &lt;em&gt;even if&lt;/em&gt; soul murder is impossible. What we're seeing here is not necessarily that people have a false belief, but that they have a belief that they are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; motivated to need it to be true. Even asking the question of whether soul murder is possible is very dangerous, because your entire practice rests on the parts you work with believing that it is not in order to feel safe enough to engage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The additional problem is that I don't believe that soul murder is impossible. I think it is likely that it's entirely possible, it's just that people are doing it wrong. You don't murder a part through violence, you murder it by persuading it to kill itself.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the themes I've been trying to work with recently is  that of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-22-17:13.html"&gt;holding myself too tightly&lt;/a&gt;. What is that part of me that does it best to maintain a calm reserve, refusing to let me engage with the world freely and joyously? It seems remarkably unwilling to budge on this. Why?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One key aspect of it is that it feels like budging is irreversible. Like if I release, I won't be able to pull myself back together. If I &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-23-13:27.html"&gt;acknowledge the pain of the world&lt;/a&gt; I will no longer be able to shut it out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But when I try to access what that feels like from the part's point of view, the core feeling is something closer to this: "AAAAAAH I WILL DIE".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To which another part of me has only this to say: "Good".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On more sophisticated reflection, I do not endorse that this would be wholly good. This reserve has served me well in many regards, it has a genuine protective function. It is there to help me, and I appreciate it. I do not want it to go away and die. I wish to ritually sacrifice it, consume its flesh, and take its power for my own.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, this metaphor is not wholly helpful for getting the part on side with this plan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In my prisoners post I said:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I hope I'm right about parts not being fully real, and are more like stable patterns in the self that serve a well defined purpose, waves that exist as part of a greater ocean. If you give a part the room and support it needs to grow, perhaps at some point it decides that its task is done, and it's ready for the wave to become the ocean again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've explained "parts not being fully real" thing in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-11-15-18:31.html"&gt;My conception of parts work&lt;/a&gt;. A part is a stuck mode of being, and the goal of parts work is to be able to get them unstuck, to allow them to stop holding themselves too tightly and fluidly reintegrate into your broader whole. The boundary of the part dissolves, and the wave becomes the ocean again. The part has died.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the part of me responsible for this reserve knows what it needs to do. The "I will die" feeling isn't &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; that of a refusal to die. It's not spitting defiance in the face of death and shouting "Not Today", it's more... it knows that it is time to let go, but it is afraid. I know how it feels, naturally, but I mean that on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Resident Contrarian &lt;a href="https://www.residentcontrarian.com/p/unsolicited-advice-on-the-institute"&gt;has a great piece on marriage&lt;/a&gt; that's mostly unrelated to this post, but in it there is a metaphor that has really stuck with me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man was walking through the woods and in time came upon a ravine. Near the ravine was a man who, after a few moments, ran full-tilt at the ravine and leapt into the void over it as if to clear the entire gulf in one mighty jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the man observed the jumper, he also noticed that he was dragging a parachute; this slowed the jumper’s running as he approached the ravine. As the Jumper leapt, the parachute filled with air, stopping his forward motion completely. He then fell into the ravine; the parachute slowed his fall enough to make sure he wasn’t seriously injured, but he still scraped and banged against the sides on his way down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man watched as the jumper climbed back out and attempted the jump again with the same results. He approached him and asked “Why are you doing that?”. “Because I want to jump the ravine”, the Jumper replied. “No, I mean - why are you using the parachute when it keeps you from being successful?”. The Jumper looked at him like he was insane, and replied “That’s to minimize the damage from the fall.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And, well, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Much of my approach to life, growth, healing, etc. is to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;make things safe&lt;/a&gt; and then act freely within that safety. I work with careful, incremental, steps where I gradually clear out problems, make new things possible, and cautiously explore and enlarge the boundaries of my comfort zone. It's worked very well for me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But with something like this, where I hold tightly to the belief that any change is irreversible, maybe there is no safe way forward? Maybe I have to accept that at a certain point, change becomes unsafe, and that you have to do it anyway, or choose cowardice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe at some point the only way forward is to take off the parachute and jump.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fewer than 100 thoughts on "Jokes"</title>
    <updated>2022-02-14T14:05:11+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Fewer than 100 thoughts on "Jokes"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-02-14&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This month is supposed to be reading month, and I'm not doing a very good job on reading new books, so I've been revisiting some old books instead. Unfortunately in order to get what I want out of this, I find myself in the position of having to do something that is anathema to my very nature: Taking notes on the books I read.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm rubbish at private writing, so I'm going to experiment with formats for doing that on here. How useful they'll be to anyone else, I don't know. Feel free to skip these.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today's format experiment is that I'm going to try to write down 100 thoughts on Ted Cohen's book "Jokes: Philosophical thoughts on joking matters". I'll first do a linear scan through the book jotting down anything that I think of as I write it or exerpting any particularly insightful quotes, then I'll start sampling at random, and once that stops working I'll try to synthesize thoughts from further up the list.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;100 may be ambitious (it's more than one thought per page in the book) but let's see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page x (in the acknowledgements before the formal numbering). "James Lorie reminds us of the ster standard according to which no joke without obscenity is really a joke, and that a really fine joke is fit for any company". What is the actual relationship between obscenity and humour? Very few of the jokes in this book are actually obscene - a few are tasteless, but very few contain actual obscenities (even the jokes about sex are mostly PG!). There is clearly something distinctive about obscene humour, but obscenity seems inessential. It's possible I'm reading this line too literally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also page x. "Nicholas Rudall is [...] one of those rare companions with whom one can work on a joke". This seems like an interesting experience that I mostly lack. I was wondering about the art of joke making, but maybe I should be focusing on the art of collaboration on a joke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 1. "The fact of jokes - the fact that there are such tings - is something of note, something worth thinking about."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 3 "Many jokes are usefully thought of as solutions to problems that have been set" - notably though, they're problems with absurd solutions. A joke that will come up later is "What do Winnie the Pooh and Alexander the Great have in common?". This is a central example of such a problem-based joke, but the reason it is a joke is that it is designed to break you out of the normal logic that you would use to address such a question. A joke that is a problem is a joke that is designed to remind you that your normal tools do not exhaust the set of tools you may need. (They have the same middle name)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Paraphrased from page 4). It is an essential feature of jokes that they rely on your prior knowledge - a joke that has to explain the background knowledge in order to get the joke will fail to land.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the background pieces of knowledge you can assume when telling jokes is that the listener is familiar with jokes. As such, you can tell jokes that are funny partly because of their relationship to the nature of telling jokes. For example "How many surrealists does it take to change a lightbulb? Fish." is not a funny joke unless you are familiar with the category of problem-solving jokes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 10. "there will be no comprehensive theory of jokes or their purpose, not only because I have no such theory but also because I believe there could be no such theory." - this is the core of what makes "Jokes" an interesting but somewhat limited book I think. It's mostly Cohen giving a tour of some things he finds interesting in the space of jokes, but it could use a bit more theory to tie it all together. I often struggle to remember what I get out of this book because of the lack of unification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I also think he's wrong about the impossibility of such a theory. His argument seems to be that joking is too contextual to admit a unifying theory, but I'm not sure this follows - eating is also very contextual, but there are unifying principles underlying our appetites and what makes a dish work. One shouldn't confuse the highly contextual nature of expertise for a lack of unity in the underlying problems being solved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 11. You can tell this is a book about philosoph of humour because it contains the following joke: "According to Freud, what comes between fear and sex? fünf". All books about philosophy of humour have to contain this joke, it's the rules.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cohen claims that this joke doesn't really work written, but I don't have a problem reading it. I wonder if this varies based on how people read and whether they hear the words in their head as they read?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back to page 10. Cohen talks about joking as a two-stage art, consisting of both composition and telling. I have &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-14-12:00.html"&gt;a whole prior post&lt;/a&gt; disagreeing with this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Page 12). There is no such thing as a pure joke. All jokes are conditional on what the audience understands - at the bare minimum you have to share a language (though this is perhaps only true in Cohen's specific conception of "joke" - it seems to me that some physical humour could be universal. Although even there you have to share a body language, which isn't as cross cultural as all that), but really a joke can only land if it fits in with and askew to the audience's understanding of the world. See &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-04-12:52.html"&gt;The humour test for expertise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cohen uses the term "hermetic" for a joke that requires extensive background knowledge or beliefs (e.g. a mathematician joke)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 17. "It is not required that the audience (or the teller) actually &lt;em&gt;believe&lt;/em&gt; that [the stereotype on which a joke was predicated], but he must be acquainted with this idea. When jokes play upon commonplaces - which may or may not be believed - they oten do it by exaggeration."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page 20. "It is difficult to say just when such jokes [about particular regional or ethnic stereotypes] become offensive." - one thing that often comes through in this book is that Cohen seems to have a very high tolerance for jokes that would definitely get you cancelled these days. It seems partly a very 20th century attitude, but also partly particular to Cohen. This isn't just that he's fine with them for other groups either - he talks about antisemitic jokes in the same way that he talks about Polish or black jokes (though, it does seem to me that his examples of antisemitic jokes are milder than his examples of racist jokes against black people. Though also in his defence, he mostly uses the latter as examples of jokes that go too far)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Page 21). "Conditional jokes that depend upon feelings in the audience, likes and dislikes, and preferences, I call affective. Typically, these jokes are understood by many people, but the success of the jokes—their capacity to amuse—depends upon the affective disposition of the audience."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Page 22). Jokes can have many layers of response. A joke can be funny to most people, but also have affective or hermetic conditions which render it funnier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Page 24). An example of this that he mentions and that I hadn't realised before is that when Hamlet says "Get thee to a nunnery", this line lands very differently if you know that "nunnery" is slang for "brothel".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Page 25). Cohen talks about the futility of trying to explain a joke, but I'm not so sure. There's definitely an art to explaining a joke so that it's funny, it's just funny for very different reasons than the joke would otherwise be funny. It's more like a sort of Stewart Lee "domming the audience into laughing". It's also very annoying, but it does work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Page 25). "a deep satisfactionin successful joke transactions is the sense held mutually by teller and hearer that they are joined in feeling". This is a recurring theme in the book - that jokes are a form of shared intimacy, based on the fact that you both find the same things funny. Cohen doesn't explicitly link this to any theory of humour, but I think part of the significance here is that a shared joke indicates that you and I find the same things incongruous, and thus that we must look at the world in a broadly similar way. Sharing a laugh is revelling in some way that we are the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Page 28). Cohen talks about communities of amusement, and I don't think he's right. He's committing a classic mistake that likeness and relationships are enough to constitute a community. People who share an amusement with you are like you, and like each other, but lack a sufficient unity as a group to constitute a community. It's more like a type than a community, and types can serve as the starting poitn for a community but are not one themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Page 31). "Why do we recommend these things to one another, anyway? [...] Because we wish one another well? Well, maybe, but at its core I do not think this is entirely a matter of altruism. [...] I discover something of what it is to be a human being by finding this thing in me, and then having it echoed in you, another human being. [...] I want you to like it beause I like you and I want you to have something you like, and I want you to be grateful to me for supplying it. But I also need you to like it, because in your liking I receive a confirmation of my own liking."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I did not make it to 100. This got me about a third of the way through the book, and took me about an hour, and I think that's enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I didn't find these useless to write, but I also don't think this is the right format. I'll probably try something more essay-like next time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You are not expected to understand this</title>
    <updated>2022-02-17T11:19:27+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;You are not expected to understand this&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-02-17&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People have been reviewing Edward Teach's book "Sadly, Porn" recently, and I love this. The reviews are hilarious. The book is probably hilarious too, but I prefer to enjoy it from afar. There's something beautifully horribly wonderfully awful about the dense rambling misanthropy-laden prose that Teach uses to reach out from the page and shape your brain, bypassing any attempt at understanding and going straight for the feeling. True art, in that it takes the world and makes it strange to you, the truth that bypasses the need for argument. You read it, you do not understand it, and you go away rejecting it and nevertheless changed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I notice that Teach has this and is high status, and therefore in keeping with Teach's teachings, I want it and desire to take it away from him. And so I shall.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an experiment and you are not expected to understand it. I encourage you to roll with that, because I certainly will not be explaining it to you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The difference between me and Teach is that Teach hates you and thinks you are contemptible, while I love you and think that you are hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are, perhaps, the same thing, because everything is the same thing. You cannot understand something well enough to love it without also knowing how to hate it. You cannot give something the attention required to hate it without also giving it the attention required to love it. The line between love and hate is razor thin and comes down solely to a choice. Perhaps the hardest choice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You will, of course, deny this, because you do not want to believe that you could hate that which you love, or love that which you hate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More importantly you want permission to maintain your hate. How could you love that? It must be impossible, and therefore it cannot be a choice, and therefore you are absolved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Don't worry, I absolve you. You are allowed to hate. All that is forbidden you is to deny the choice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is a part of you that craves being understood. There is a part of you that feels burdened by the need to be understood. These are the same part because every part of you is the same. Parts are an illusion created to deal with others. Others are an illusion created to give you parts. Everything is the same, and everyone is the same, and when you choose between love and hate you are also choosing how to love and hate yourself.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Everything is the same as everything else, but also everything is different from everything else. Fortunately, "Everything is the same as everything else" is the same as "Everything is different from everything else".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"But wait", you say. "Surely "Everything is the same as everything else" is obviously different from "Everything is different from everything else"?". Yes exactly, now you're getting it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Like love and hate, same and different are choices you make about the world, not the world itself. Everything is the same, if you choose it to be the same, everything is different, if you choose it to be different.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To your counterexample, I say this: I never said it was an &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; choice. Shush now, listen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The way you look at the world, at the other, and yourself, is the way you have chosen to look at it in order to make it safe to look at. You are bound in by walls of fear, desperately denying your attention to that which you cannot safely look at.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You cannot hate what you fear, not truly, because you cannot look at it at all, so you cannot love it, so you cannot hate it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You choose sameness, and difference, in line with what you can handle. That which you love must be different from that which you hate, because you fear them being the same.
A careful dance of merging and differentiating until the universe achieves a configuration that you believe you can live with.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This works, for a time, but life is a continual confrontation with the universe as it is, and you are forced to face over and over again that that which you chose the same is diferent, and that which you chose diferent is the same.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember: You are hilarious and I love you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You are hilarious because you are an absurd mass of contradictions, maintaining this ridiculous pretense of sameness and differentiation in the face of a universe that cares not at all about your illusions, but also cares deeply about them because it is you and you are it because everything is the same.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Remember though, contradictions do not exist. That which is, is, and everything that is true of it is consistent. You create contradictions because you are small, too small to handle the vastness of everything, so you spread your web of understanding gossamer-thin across a universe that is too large to contain, and then cry at its inevitable breaking, and then to try again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You are small, but you strive to contain the world.
I think this is beautiful and I love you for it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beef and lentil stew "recipe"</title>
    <updated>2022-04-05T21:56:10+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Beef and lentil stew "recipe"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-04-05&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was going through some dead drafts and found the following recipe that I'd forgotten about that I was regularly making in the instant pot during this past winter and had completely forgotten about, so I thought I would save it here before I deleted the draft:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olive oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chopped white onions (I use frozen, which is honestly great), enough to cover the base of the instant pot so I guess a couple cups?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple cloves worth of chopped garlic (frozen again)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pack of bacon (often frozen too, but that’s irrelevant here it’s just where I keep my bacon)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minced beef, about 750g&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A cup and a half of green lentils&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chilli, rosemary, and thyme, to taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt, also to taste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two cans of chopped tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three or four large carrots, sliced into coins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A couple of potatoes, chopped into cubes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two beef stock cubes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About half a bottle of red wine (I used what is probably a perfectly adequate Malbec last time but honestly I know nothing about wine)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To make it, pretty much do the obvious things. Put the instant pot on sauté, fry the onion and garlic with the spices, chop the bacon and add that at some point, then once that’s cooked add in the beef until it’s browned, then add in everything else, stir thoroughly, and add wine until the whole thing is covered in liquid. Put on a low pressure cook for half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve written about this style of recipe before, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-07-10:05.html"&gt;in the context of an apple and cashew dessert dish I like&lt;/a&gt; (which reminds me, I should make it again), and I got the response from someone that it “wasn’t a recipe”. They’re probably just as angry about the above recipe, and in some sense they’re right. Certainly you won’t recreate the dish exactly based on the above explanation, but nor do I recreate the dish exactly each time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But independently of whether or not it’s consistently the same dish each time, the result is delicious, and very satisfying as a winter meal, and I end up eating far too much of it every time I make it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's interesting how easy it is to forget and lose the habit of recipes. I was making this extremely regularly, but utterly forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Notes towards a name</title>
    <updated>2022-04-30T11:56:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Notes towards a name&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-04-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/connerdelights/status/1519705466854539265"&gt;Andrew Conner&lt;/a&gt; asked on Twitter "What would you call this?" where "this" means "the thing that is like philosophy but not", and this lead to a discussion between me, him, and David Chapman in which we all expressed our frustration as to what it is we actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;.  More specifically, what do we call it?
None of us know.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hubristically, I replied, "This seems like a dumb problem for us to have. Maybe I'll fix it". So here I am, trying to fix it. These are some rough notes that I am writing because it is useful to write out my thoughts on the subject, and sharing because they may be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What is it I actually do?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the best way I can explain what I do is this: You know how some days you find yourself thinking "Holy shit why does being human not come with a user manual?". I'm trying to write that user manual.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, a completely impossible task. Such a user manual would be unusably vast, and I am not qualified to write more than a tiny fraction of it. That's OK. I'm not trying to write more than a tiny fraction of it, and most people don't need more than a tiny fraction of it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's perhaps more accurate to say that what I am trying to do is develop the general skill of writing the thing that you would get if you were to look up the section of the humanity user manual that you need right now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My basic question is "What is it like to be human and how can we be better at it?"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;David Chapman has as a tagline "Better ways of thinking, feeling, and acting" and that definitely feels like part of what I do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"How to live" is maybe closer. It's a bit too close to the Aristotelean "How to have a good life" (which is not a frame I like).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps "How to think about living" is closer?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My tagline for my newsletter is "Overthinking everything", which is a bit tongue in cheek, but I do think captures something important.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps "Tools of thought for living"? Or "Tools for living".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"How to think about living in a way that helps you flourish"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have always liked "Human flourishing" as a turn of phrase. It's a little connected up to virtue ethics and the like, and I do tend to reject the eudaimonic frame of "happiness" as the end goal of life, partly because I don't think framing life as having a goal is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is something fundamentally ethical about my project though. "How to live" is very much the classical point of ethics, although not of modern ethics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is in general a theme of what I do. It's &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; a lot of things, but as they were meant to be and good though.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do think that what distinguishes me from philosophy in general is that I'm more interested in the practical side of it. If you consider the think/feel/act split, I'm interested in all three but my goals are in decreasing order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is funny because I'm primarily working on the think layer, but that's because it's a very high leverage layer (especially for me). How you think has a huge amount of impact on what you do and how you feel about it, and I'm trying to use thinking to improve your experience of the world. It is a focus on right action rather than right thought, and in getting these all to line up in a way that you feel good about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is part of why I'm not sure I'm a fan of applying the "philosophy" label to what I do. I don't love wisdom, I just say that to get it into bed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It does tie back into the virtue ethics thing again, but I do like "phronesis" as a word - practical wisdom. And to a large degree this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what I work on. Practical wisdom for living.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What does David Chapman do?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Honestly, beats me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1519788775337074695"&gt;I said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that part of my problem with coming up with a common name is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes I feel like you and I are working on basically the same problem and sometimes I feel like you and I are working on completely unrelated projects, and I'm not sure I could come up with a coherent justification for either feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I like David and I value our conversations, but I really don't know that I know what his project is about, and I suspect he feels the same way about me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So let's start with how David and I differ (aside from in our last names).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think his &lt;a href="https://metarationality.com/"&gt;metarationality&lt;/a&gt; project is probably heavily overlapping with mine, in that we're both concerned with the problem of how people think in practical contexts and how to do that better, but I think of his main work (certainly it's his Twitter handle!) is Meaningness, and this is the one I can't really tell if it's at all similar to what I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you look at &lt;a href="https://meaningness.com/"&gt;meaningness.com&lt;/a&gt; his tagline is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better ways of thinking, feeling, and acting—around problems of meaning and meaninglessness; self and society; ethics, purpose, and value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And we're kinda overlapping on all of this except... I don't feel like I'm particularly invested in the questions of meaning and purpose, which I think is rather his whole thing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is about meaningness. “Meaningness” is a word I invented, referring to the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “meaning” has two quite different meanings in English. It can refer to the meaning of symbols, such as words and road signs. This book is not about that kind of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People also speak of “the meaning of life.” That is the sort of meaningness this book is about. So I apply “meaningness” only to the sorts of things one could describe as “deeply meaningful” or “pretty meaningless.” The book is about matters such as purpose, ethics, and selfhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaningness is a quality, not a thing. I don’t think there is a definite meaning of life. Meaningness is always nebulous: indefinite, uncertain, ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I must admit I don't find this very personally interesting. It's not &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; connected to my project, but I think if someone came to me talking about this as their core issue I would probably start by checking if they were depressed, or if their life sucked in concrete manners.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do basically buy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eggprophet/status/1470425201615773702"&gt;eggprophet's model&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what if ur complicated, high status problems like "meaning crisis" "culture war" "societies fall in epicureanism" are actually simple, low-status problems like "bored" "want community" "need blanket"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Bored" definitely feels closer to any problem I want to address than "lack of meaning" does.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear, I don't mean this as a dismissal of David's project. I love it when other people get deeply invested in things that I don't find very interesting, because then I can come in afterwards and extract the bits that I care about and wouldn't have figured out on my own. But this does suggest that David's meaningness project and my project are not necessarily that closely tied.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to be lucky</title>
    <updated>2022-05-25T10:01:29+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;How to be lucky&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-25&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be doing some draft bankruptcy over the coming week or two,
where I delete things from my newsletter drafts and post salvageable bits
here on the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's some extracts from a piece called "How to be lucky" that I may or may
not eventually write, but certainly will want to start from scratch with 
a little bit of reused material rather than trying to ressurect this draft.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Luck, happenstance, and circumstance&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'd like to distinguish three different things that are often called
luck, and I will only use "luck" to refer to one of them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first thing is what I'd like to call &lt;em&gt;happenstance&lt;/em&gt;. An event that
happens as a result of chance. You might win the lottery, you might be
late for a meeting, you might go a different route than usual and
discover something interesting... These are all chance events, they
might be good they might be bad, they might be neutral.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People will often refer to individual happenstance events as lucky or
unlucky, which is perfectly reasonable in normal usage but not how I
will be using the term. Winning the lottery is not, in the sense I will
be using it, the result of luck, it's just random chance. Could have
happened to anyone who played the lottery. If you exhibited a consistent
tendency to win the lottery I would call &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; luck, but not a single
win no matter how large, it's just a highly positive happenstance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Circumstance on the other hand is the conditions in which you find
yourself. This too is often referred to as luck. e.g. you're lucky to be
born into a rich family, you're lucky to have good friends, you're lucky
to be in a secure job, etc. I again think this is perfectly reasonable
usage, but it's not what I mean when I say "luck" here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I say luck, what I specifically mean is the aggregate effect of
happenstance in your life. Good luck is the tendency of chance events
to, on average, improve your life. Bad luck is the tendency of chance
events to, again on average, make your life worse.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Four types of circumstance&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about circumstances and how they impact luck. Many of these
things will be out of your control (or only weakly under your control),
and I'll talk about things that are more under your control in a bit,
but I think it's important to be up front about the different fortune
landscapes people find themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to be lucky is to have circumstances that enable
it. Here are some such circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first way is that you can be rich, either in money or other
resources. Luck is, ultimately, about being able to benefit from random
chance, and this involves playing a lot of numbers games. By far the
easiest way to be able to play numbers games is to have a lot of buffer
against risk. If a great opportunity comes your way and it costs £1000
but will probably earn you much more than that (in money or other
value), then there are roughly three options: You might not be able to
pay £1000 at all, in which case sucks to be you. £1000 might be
affordable but not an amount you can comfortably risk, in which case you
may or may not take the opportunity but you certainly can't take the
next such opportunity that comes along if this one falls through. Or you
can be well enough off that £1000 isn't a big deal to risk given the
high upside. Rich people are luckier than poor people because they have
the opportunity to take advantage of many sources of happenstances that
improve their life that are too risky if you're poor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second way is that you can be extroverted, sociable, etc. Social
connections are one of the biggest and most accessible source of luck in
day to day life - you meet people who will transform your life, your
social circumstances, give you access to opportunities you'd otherwise
lack, etc. There's &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0190272518812010"&gt;a whole paper about how the best way to be lucky is
to go to more
parties&lt;/a&gt;.
It's much easier to take advantage of this if you naturally want to
spend lots of time socialising, are good at it, and find it emotionally
rewarding rather than a source of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third way is that you can be
pretty (I tend to use "pretty" in a gender neutral sense. There are some very
pretty men out there. That being said, the way this manifests is definitely different with different genders).
This tends to raise the chances of success in a lot of circumstances - people will
seek you out more, give you more opportunities, you'll benefit from halo
effects, etc. Being pretty tends to both increase the number of
opportunities (because they seek you out) and increase the chances of
any of those opportunities that depend on the judgement of others from
working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these are somewhat changeable but are at best hard to change,
and aren't necessarily where your bottleneck &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Luck as a skill&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn't mean you can learn to be supernaturally lucky. There's
no way you can, for example, improve your ability to play the lottery.
You will probably, on average, be luckier if you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; play the
lottery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It also doesn't mean that everyone's luck is purely determined by their
skill. There are roughly three components to luck, in decreasing order
of importance for most people:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privilege&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes, chance is the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; important component of luck, I promise. It's
not that chance doesn't matter, it's that if chance matters too much you
are not actually being lucky.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason, in short, is that luck mostly occurs as the sum of many
chance events, and statistically the chance effects average out over
time. If you toss a coin 100 times, you've no ability to predict which
way any given coin toss will go, but you'll get heads about 50 times,
and you'll with overwhelming likelihood get heads between about 30 and
70 times.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Privilege on the other hand can matter a great deal. For example, people
who are unusually attractive or unusually intelligent will have a much
easier time being lucky (more on why later). It's also &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; easier
to be lucky if you're wealthy or have other resources you can draw on.
If that's you, you can capitalise on it, and it's worth paying attention
to, but ultimately what matters more is how these affect your ability to
develop the skill of luck than the privilege itself.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the most important part: Skill. This is the most
important part both because it's the bit that matters the most, and also
because it's the bit that's most under your control.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;An informal mathematical glossary&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here I've deleted a lot of material that I covered better in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-29-09:43.html"&gt;Probably enough probability for you&lt;/a&gt; so go read that bit instead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Luck 101&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Luck is a numbers game. Luck is the aggregate result of many small
events, each of which is unlikely to have any upside, but which on
average have a much greater upside than their cost. Let's call these
events &lt;em&gt;opportunities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Getting luckier is a process involving two things:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing the number of opportunities you take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the average effectiveness of opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Privilege affects these differently. e.g. Being resource-rich tends to
make the first easy, being attractive tends to maximise the second, but
both are under your control to a large degree.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, note that this is somewhat non-uniform, in that the &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of
opportunities available to you matter a great deal. It's possible to
e.g. be very lucky in business but have no luck in dating (or vice
versa), due to being good at these in one context and bad in another.
This is particularly true for people who have never spent much time
strategizing about luck in general and have just, well, lucked into some
good habits in some specific contexts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Lottery luck&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Imagine a simple lottery, you pay £1, you have a one in 10 million
chance of winning £1 million. You play the lottery, and unsurprisingly
you don't win. Someone else plays the lottery, and they do. Are they
luckier than you?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this specific instance, they have certainly been luckier than you,
but in a generalisable sense they are not. What actually happened is
that millions of people played the lottery, so even though every
individual one was a sucker, one or two people got lucky. Those people
have what you might call lottery luck - it's a one off unrepeatable event,
and any strategy for improving your luck that relies on lottery luck is
a losing game.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can think of the basic practice of luck as being about trying
repeatedly, and seeking lottery luck is &lt;em&gt;actively harmful&lt;/em&gt; for this
because the more times you try the worse off you will be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What would have come next&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the point at which the draft trails off, which is unfortunate as what comes next is all the interesting bits.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What I was planning on covering next ties together:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The work of Richard Wiseman in his book "The Luck Factor" which I think is
  a very good book for getting better at an important but kinda boring type of
  luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Lui's notion of &lt;a href="https://brianlui.dog/2020/10/06/upside-decay/"&gt;Upside decay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lewis Hyde's book "Trickster Makes This World", which is about trickster myths and what they teach us about luck and creativity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core idea being that the most interesting skill of luck is treating your engagement with the world as a creative process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a mild post mortem note, I think one thing this points to is that when writing a newsletter post I should &lt;em&gt;start by writing the interesting bits&lt;/em&gt;. Then I can backfill to give people an onramp to it if I think that's actually necessary. Write the newsletter more like the notebook, so that when I hit the point where I'm done and don't want to write any more I can just click send. Writing as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-23-15:52.html"&gt;an anytime algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Promethean work</title>
    <updated>2022-05-26T07:12:18+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Promethean work&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is another draft bankruptcy post. The following is the only
bit I had written from a post entitled "Stealing lifehacks from the gods":&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do you ever think about how weird it would be to be in the myth of
Prometheus?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prometheus stumbles into camp, looking haggard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prometheus, you have returned from Mount Olympus! What have you
brought back from your time among the gods?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Uh, well, I've brought back the secret of fire. Pretty sure that'll
be helpful. Very useful stuff, fire."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tell us, oh great Prometheus! What powers must we invoke to summon
fire? What rituals must we perform?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Um, yes. Rituals. OK, so, you take some dry grass, and two sticks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Grass... and sticks? Do we fashion these into an offering? Do we
carve runes into them?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, you see, what you do is, you rub the sticks together. After a
while they'll get real hot. Then you put the hot sticks on the grass
and it'll catch fire because dry things catch fire when they get hot."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What the actual fuck, Prometheus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, kicking myself for not thinking of it on my own TBH. Still,
it's a simple enough trick that at least the gods won't be super mad
at me for borrowing it, huh?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Please note that this both entirely misrepresents &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus"&gt;the myth of
Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8C8qPoMZdo"&gt;how to
start a fire with sticks&lt;/a&gt;.
But in my defence it's funnier that way)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This actually &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1521187395319836676"&gt;got turned into a tweet&lt;/a&gt; way earlier,
and was probably more like a tweet worth of idea.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core to this is that a lot of what I do is go into complicated specialised disciplines and try to take their most accessible ideas and make them broadly useful. This is Promethean work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1520007832556474368"&gt;related tweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have seen far, it is because I have repeatedly wandered up to giants and asked "Gosh! How did you get so tall?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Leaving shiny things behind</title>
    <updated>2022-05-27T14:08:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Leaving shiny things behind&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something I've been thinking about recently is how useful it is to have names to describe crucial aspects of your problems.
Not that this is a new thought, but it's been on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result of this thought process, I realised I needed a name for a particular phenomenon: The way it is very hard for me to focus in the presence of my phone, which tends to grab my attention and lead to me checking Twitter without really meaning to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I propose the following name: The phone is a &lt;em&gt;shiny thing&lt;/em&gt;. Shiny things catch your eye with their glint, in a way that makes it hard to avoid looking at them. As long as they are in your field of awareness somehow, you have to put in active effort to not pay attention to them, because they have a natural gravity to them that distracts and captures your attention.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shiny things aren't necessarily interesting or desirable.
Another example of a shiny thing is when the TV is on in a room, even with the sound off - even if you literally couldn't care less about what's on the TV, the fact that it is there with its attractive moving pictures tends to naturally draw your attention. Observe how much less engaged a conversation happening in a room with the TV on in the background is, even when you could in theory easily ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shiny things aren't intrinsically bad - I like my phone, I like Twitter, I like watching TV - but they are bad to have around &lt;em&gt;when your purpose is not to engage with the shiny thing&lt;/em&gt;, because they entice and draw your attention. Even if you successfully avoid them, you expend energy on doing so that could be more productively used. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's possible that a sufficiently advanced set of mental skills could allow one to be immune to shiny things. It's not unlike &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/first-hard-choice"&gt;The first hard choice&lt;/a&gt;, where you would like to be able to listen to the sirens' song without being drawn onto the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But unlike the sirens, there is no virtue to being in the presence of a shiny thing that you don't currently want to use. It's just a pure cost. They can be there when you actively choose to use them, but they should be put away when you do not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been going on my stupid little walks for my stupid mental and physical health without my phone, and it has greatly improved the experience. Sometimes I bring a book, sometimes I bring a dictaphone, but neither of these are shiny in the way that my phone is, and so they do not distract me from doing whatever it is I choose to do in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
