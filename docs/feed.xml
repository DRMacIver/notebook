    <title>Democracy isn't just voting</title>

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Democracy isn't just voting&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-24&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This post's reading comes from Amartya Sen's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2XYL8aP"&gt;Identity and Violence&lt;/a&gt;", page 55, although actually it mostly comes from Nelson Mandela's "Long Walk to Freedom" (which I haven't read).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his autobiography &lt;em&gt;Long Walk to Freedom&lt;/em&gt;, Nelson Mandela describes how influenced he was, as a young boy, by seeing the democratic nature of the proceedings of the local meetings in his African hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who wanted to speak did so. It was democracy in its purest form. There may have been a hierarchy of importance among the speakers, but everyone was heard, chief and subject, warrior and medicine man, shopkeeper and farmer, landowner and laborer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In context the point that Sen is making is that the idea we have of democracy as a "western" ideal that we've inherited from the greeks and imposed on the rest of the world is bogus, and in fact democracy taken in the general 
as any form of collective decision making that involves its participants equally in the process is found in my cultures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'd like to highlight something else: The democratic ideal that he is describing is actually quite far from the western one, and it's better.
These days in a lot of the west we have this very anemic idea of democracy, where we've basically reduced it to voting,
and voting is in many ways supposed to be the thing you do when better ways of doing democracy have failed.
Reducing democracy to voting is already failure, even before you get into the question of what voting system you should use.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Really the starting point for democracy is not the vote but the discussion (not the debate!) - people getting together to try to figure out the best solution, in a way that respects everyone's needs and viewpoints. Everyone speaks, everyone listens. You don't necessarily have to all agree at the end (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"&gt;Consensus-building&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes a good idea, but it's hard and not always worth it), but everyone has the option to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't to say that voting is never a good feature in democracy. Voting has a lot of advantages when what you want is a relatively low cost way of deciding between a small number of options, but most decision making isn't like that (and the decision theorists who tell you it is are lying to you). Most of the interesting parts of the democratic process consist of getting to the point where you can reduce things to that small number of decisions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is particularly useful for &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/11/democracy-for-lunch/"&gt;decisions that don't matter very much&lt;/a&gt;, because it lets you get them out of the way quickly, but for more momentous decisions it largely comes at the end when you've exhausted the possibility of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the big limitations of voting over discussion is that it cannot put new things on the table. You can vote for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above#Re-open_Nominations_(RON)"&gt;RON&lt;/a&gt; (the only candidate that can promise change!) in some systems, but most voting in practice does not meaningfully allow that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, I think, suggests a feature that is important and absent from most voting systems: They need to be able to fail. One possible conclusion of voting should be that it concludes that you weren't ready for voting yet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Consensus seeking votes are the easiest example of such a thing: Unless 100% of people agree on an option, the vote fails and you have to go back to discussion. You can do similar things by requiring supermajorities: If \(\frac{2}{3}\) of people approve some outcome, you select that, otherwise back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think one reason we overfocus on voting is that it's easier to do at scale (lotteries are also easy to do at scale, but we don't like those for various reasons - some good, some bad). The democratic ideal of discussion really only works with small groups - even our parliaments are too large to really manage it, let alone our populations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I feel like there are probably systems that solve this by essentially patchworking together many small democratic groups, but perhaps the biggest problem with getting there is how little small scale democracy there is in most people's lives. The overwhelming majority of small group interactions we have result in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-15:27.html"&gt;someone basically taking charge&lt;/a&gt;, and because people are increasingly atomized most of us don't seem to be part of any communities that could be or would benefit from being democratically run (maybe this isn't true? It's certainly my impression).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do think one part of that is the absence of good &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/the-missing-social-technology-sector/"&gt;social technology&lt;/a&gt; for this. John Gastil's &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ePnt2m"&gt;Democracy in Small Groups&lt;/a&gt; describes how small group democracy is actually implemented in practice in some of the communities where we do have that, and frankly I'm a democracy fan and I still think it sounds &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe what is needed is something like &lt;a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/"&gt;Liberating Structures&lt;/a&gt;? A toolkit of easy to use small group democratic processes that people can just plug in to their lives and use where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The conditional love of a small town</title>
    <updated>2020-04-25T12:12:56+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;The conditional love of a small town&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-25&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From bell hooks's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2W0Q9gk"&gt;All About Love&lt;/a&gt;", Page 100:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like living in small towns precisely because they are most often the places in our nation where basic principles underlying a love ethic exist and are the standards by which most people try to live their lives. In the small town where I live (now only some of the time) there is a spirit of neighborliness [...] We protect and nurture our collective well-being. We try to make our home place a positive environment for everyone. We all agree that integrity and care enhance all our lives. We try to live by the principles of a love ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the book she defines love based on the work of Erich Fromm as "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of one's own or another's spiritual growth", which is a definition I quite like (with perhaps mild quibbles about the word "spiritual"), although given how into personal growth I am (it's practically a love language), I would.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So a community that lives by a love ethic is one where everyone is committed to contributing to each other's personal growth.
Such a community is &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; appealing to me, and I often fantasize about finding or creating it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, the idea of finding such a community in a small town? Not just no, but hell no.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing I think this illustrates is how non-transferable experiences of marginalisation are.
bell hooks obviously has more experience of marginalisation than I do - she is a black woman in the US, while I am in most regards a fairly privileged white man. But I am also a queer neurodivergent person, and the experience of small towns for people like me is literally the worst.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're sufficiently "weird" and live or go to school in a small town, chances are pretty good you know almost nobody like you, and it's awful.
In a large city you may still struggle to find people like you, but those people are at least there and once you've found a few you will find more through them. It is possible to build a community of people like you, and to build a love ethic within that community, in a way that I don't think people like me are ever going to really find in a small town.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been reading James C. Scott's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2Kzllyc"&gt;The Art of Not Being Governed&lt;/a&gt;" recently (a book I suspect has never previously been linked to bell hooks's "All About Love"), which is about the hill people of Zomia, a large region of South East Asia, and their relationship to the states. In particular it points out that that rather than being some sort of "living ancestors" of the people of the valley states, the hill people are typically the descendants of refugees who fled the state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things that this has been making me think about is the use of marginalisation as an enabling technology. Many schemes for organising humanity along legible lines work much better if you can just get the people who don't fit to leave. Otherwise you'd have to force them to conform to the system (hard, probably causes rebellions), kill them (same. Also ethics I guess), or adapt the system in order to accommodate the actual richness of human experience (yeah right).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the case of Zomia this is a flight from the large to the small - from the big states to the small isolated communities of the hills - but when it comes to towns there's an equal flight from the small to the large. The people who are weird and don't fit in nope out of the small towns and go find somewhere where they're less constrained. Small communities enforce their own sort of legibility on the people within them, and those who are illegible to them flee to the cities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It may well be that small towns do exhibit the sort of love aesthetic that bell hooks describes, where everyone living in them promotes each other's spiritual growth, but if so they do so by driving out everyone who tries to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;grow in ways that are not approved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fixed and growth relationships</title>
    <updated>2020-04-26T09:14:44+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Fixed and growth relationships&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today the successor group to our Rewriting the Rules reading group is meeting, and we're talking about daily habits we've tried to implement over the last couple of weeks. My habit has been rereading - dropping into books I've already read and reading at least one page from them (usually more, but the success criterion is one page). That habit lead more or less directly to the current "Today's reading" style of notebook posts, so I thought I would honour it with an appropriate choice of book today.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3eQhfQ3"&gt;Rewriting the Rules&lt;/a&gt;", Page 207:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, fixing or objectifying yourself is extremely common. It comes back to the sense that we're lacking, which we explored in Chapter 2. Much of the power of falling in love comes from the fact we find ourselves fixed in the gaze of another person in a wonderful way. This person dancing opposite me in a nightclub, sitting across from me over a candlelit dinner, or lying next to me in bed, gazes at me in adoration. The vision of myself that I see reflected in their eyes is a person I'd dearly love to be. It's like they see all the good stuff and none of the bad. As long as they look at me like that perhaps I can pretend there &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; any bad in me. Maybe they're right and I really &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; that loveable through and through. No wonder love can feel like a drug we can't get enough of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In context "fixed" is meant to mean "set" or "frozen", not the opposite of broken. MJB is talking about the tendency to want to see ourselves as singular, well-defined, identities rather than, to use their term, plural and in progress. This is in a chapter about conflict, and follows on from talking about how Sartre considers us to be unavoidably in conflict with each other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Things that immediately come to mind in response to this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Naturally, thinking about conflict makes me think of Thomas Schelling's book about nuclear war, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3bGnLXp"&gt;The Strategy of Conflict&lt;/a&gt; where he defines conflicts as positive-sum games with imperfectly aligned incentives. This is a perfect way of looking at relationships, romantic and otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thinking about relationship problems inevitably makes me think of my own post &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html"&gt;Trust beyond reason&lt;/a&gt;, because it has become my explain-everything theory for relationship problems: Relationship problems exist because you do not trust someone at a level that is needed for their importance to you to be safe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationships as fixing you contrasts interestingly with bell hooks's notion of love as growth that I mentioned in my &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-25-10:40.html"&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, putting me in mind of a relationship version of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_Growth_Mindset"&gt;fixed vs growth mindset&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have roughly two experiences of romantic love. In one, it was definitely quite in line with this idea of fixing each other into ideal versions of our selves. In the other (the current one), it is much more in line with bell hooks's notion of love as growth. The latter is much better, let me tell you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sartre is correct, people are unavoidably in conflict, at least in the Schelling sense: Our relationships are positive sum games, in which our incentives are perfectly aligned. What we want out from the other is not exactly the same as what the other wants for themself. That doesn't necessarily mean that we would ever want to force them to do what we want instead of what they want, it just means that we have preferences and feelings about what they do that are somewhat separated from their own.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In and of itself there is nothing wrong with this, but one thing that I think goes wrong is that we are terrified of our partners rejecting us, and we fear that going against their preferences will cause them to do so. We may not believe this, but we certainly &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html"&gt;alieve&lt;/a&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One strategy for conflict is to credibly threaten to punish the other party for going against your interests. Even if the punishment is costly, this can be worth doing. Mutually Assured Destruction is an example of this - once you know the other side has launched nuclear weapons at you, there is literally no benefit to you launching nuclear weapons back. It's a purely vindictive act that will not save you but will destroy them. However, the fact that you were able to credibly commit to doing this makes it very unlikely (unless they fuck up, which is always the concern) that they will ever launch those nuclear missiles in the first place. By making the threat you have changed the pay off matrix, so that the option where they launch nuclear missiles at you is no longer high payoff for them (because it results in their obliteration as well).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this analogy, the fear of rejection is the nuclear threat.
While rejection is not quite as bad as having your country obliterated and millions of lives lost to atomic fire, from the inside it can be hard to remember that, especially if you're &lt;a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/trauma-and-cptsd-101/"&gt;traumatised&lt;/a&gt; by a history of being treated badly (whether by family, peers, or in relationships).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You may argue that one should note be adopting manipulative tactics in a relationship (you certainly shouldn't be &lt;em&gt;threatening&lt;/em&gt; your partner!), and you would be right, but unfortunately it's not that simple: Generally speaking tactics we adopt are not the result of deliberate forethought, they are the result of our behaviours being shaped over time in response to feedback and incentives. Many of our behaviours are &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;legacy code&lt;/a&gt;, and many more of them are &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html"&gt;contingent cultural effects&lt;/a&gt; that we have learned in response to each other in a given context.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about mutually assured destruction is that, generally speaking, nobody dies in atomic fire. That's good. It is strictly better than people dying in atomic fire. Good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; nice thing about mutually assured destruction is that &lt;em&gt;everybody is constantly stressed out about the possibility of dying in atomic fire&lt;/em&gt;. This is still vastly better than dying, but is quite a lot worse than not being stressed out about dying.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The same is true in relationships. Not being rejected is good, but being constantly afraid of being rejected as a way to achieve that is bad. This fear of rejection is a major part of what causes us to fix ourselves into a version seen by our partner: We try to fix ourselves as the version that will not be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;bell hooks defines love as "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of one's own or another's spiritual growth". But growth &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;requires safety&lt;/a&gt; - if you are living in fear of rejection, you will not feel safe, and you will not be able to grow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This means love in hooks sense requires us to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-06-15:20.html"&gt;be safe for others&lt;/a&gt; who we are to be in a relationship with. If your partner is to express themselves honestly, it needs to be safe for them to do so. This means you need to:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not react with judgement or blame when they tell you how they're feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also&lt;/em&gt; not automatically change your behaviour to accommodate everything that they're feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is a form of rejection, and is exactly what people are afraid of. The second is often an overreaction and, because your partner loves you, may cause them to avoid telling you things for fear of causing you harm.
After all, if you know that someone you love will react as if they're a terrible person because they caused you some mild discomfort, are you going to share that discomfort with them?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once you have this safety, it becomes possible to build trust to a much greater degree, because you know that that trust building will not be met with rejection. This is the extending of one's self that bell hooks is talking about: You are putting yourself into the relationship, in a way that allows the other to know you, and gives them &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html"&gt;permission&lt;/a&gt; to be known by you in turn.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This also allows you to know yourself in a way that is almost impossible to achieve on your own.
Self-awareness allows us to know many things about our selves that are not visible to others,
and that this fear of extending ourselves into the world causes us to deliberately hide from them,
but we discount how many things about ourselves that we have no idea about are visible to others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cOWfXU"&gt;Mindfulness in 3D&lt;/a&gt;" Peter Nobes talks about &lt;em&gt;Faulty Sensory Appreciation&lt;/em&gt; - the idea that our image of our self, especially of our posture, is often completely wrong in ways that are really obvious to others. He goes into this less in the book, but talking to Peter makes it clear how broadly he thinks it applies, and I agree. Often our moods are more obvious to those around us than they are to ourselves. Certainly how we come across to others is often invisible to us, and is often reflective of underlying learned reactions that we are not consciously aware of.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When our reactions in a relationship are safe, it becomes possible not only for our partners to tell us about their selves, but also for them to tell us about ourselves, and through this reciprocated love we can grow together.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>78 Thinking Hats</title>
    <updated>2020-04-26T13:22:08+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;78 Thinking Hats&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This post is breaking the trend and is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; based on a random passage from a book, so is a bonus post for today, though it will contain multiple references to books.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2VCBSYa"&gt;Six Thinking Hats&lt;/a&gt;" Edward de Bono talks about the idea of there being six "directions" that you can pull thought in, each of which is best characterised by a coloured hat. Because he's de Bono, and thus a self-important asshole, the book opens as follows:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Six Thinking Hats method may well be the most important change in human thinking for the past twenty-three hundred years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uh huh.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He goes on to say:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That may seem a rather exaggerated claim but the evidence is beginning to point that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No it isn't, shut up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Despite my intense dislike for de Bono as a human being, the book isn't bad, and has some moderately useful ideas in it, and each of the different directions of thought &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; one that is useful to push your thinking in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To quote his description of the hats (page 13):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;White Hat&lt;/strong&gt; White is neutral and objective. The white hat is concerned with objective facts and figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt; Red suggests anger (seeing red), rage and emotions. The red hat gives the emotional view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Hat&lt;/strong&gt; Black is sombre and serious. The black hat is cautious and careful. It points out the weaknesses in an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yellow Hat&lt;/strong&gt; Yellow is sunny and positive. The yellow hat is optimistic and covers hope and positive thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Green Hat&lt;/strong&gt; Green is grass, vegetation and abundant, fertile growth. The green hat indicates creativity and new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blue Hat&lt;/strong&gt; Blue is cool, and it is also the colour of the sky, which is above everything else. The blue hat is concerned with control, the organization of the thinking process and the use of other hats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The hats pair as White and Red, Black and Yellow, Green and Blue, each defining an opposite direction.
The idea is that people adopt a hat at a time, with the hats giving them &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html"&gt;permission&lt;/a&gt; to pull their thinking further in that direction than they otherwise would.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do de Bono's ideas work? Yeah, I think they do. Certainly I've got some good use out of some of his ideas from another of his books, "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/355DAVj"&gt;Lateral Thinking&lt;/a&gt;", but I think his ideas work for a very simple reason: It's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to come up with things that don't work.
The main thing de Bono's ideas having going for them is that de Bono is very good at marketing his ideas in a way that only causes &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; people to dismiss them instead of everyone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;His books are short and kinda interesting, so I don't recommend against reading them and might read a few more in future, but I think most of the value they bring comes from the fact that not enough people are doing this sort of thing because it would be &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;too weird&lt;/a&gt;,
and if you want to use de Bono's work for groups you're better off looking at something like &lt;a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/"&gt;liberating structures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Basically, I think that almost &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; you can do that pulls your thinking in a direction that it doesn't naturally gravitate will prove interesting. We've been seeing that with the recent use of random readings from books to prompt posts - I'm still finding my feet on that a bit, but I think it's been very positive and it's certainly caused me to write things I would not otherwise be writing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which ties in to something I've been thinking about for years but have never really got around to doing, which is Tarot reading.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tarot obviously doesn't let you foresee the future, except insofar as you can already foresee the future because brains are causal reasoning machines that are fairly good at predicting the future on their own. Instead, tarot cards are a tool for randomised prompts for narrative construction, but having those randomised prompts causes you to construct narratives or think about things in ways that you wouldn't necessarily otherwise do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Learning Tarot "properly" is something I keep putting off, so given the success of the randomised prompts from books, I thought it might be worth integrating some of it into my writing practice.
How exactly this plays out will be something to experiment with, but if nothing else it will drive familiarity with the cards.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For convenient linkability I'll use the cards descriptions from &lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/"&gt;www.learntarot.com&lt;/a&gt; (the author of that site also has &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3aD3zo7"&gt;a book that I'll be consulting&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today I drew a pair of cards:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj02.htm"&gt;The High Priestess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/p2.htm"&gt;The Two of Pentacles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A core theme of the high priestess is intuition and mystery, paying attention to the subconscious. Actions listed include "Using your intuition" and "Seeking guidance from within". She is described as "the guardian of the unconscious".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The two of pentacles is, among other things, about fun and flexibility. Actions include "going with the flow" and "doing something you enjoy". The two of pentancles is described as "There is nothing quite like the feeling of being graceful and effective at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This puts me in mind of Focusing and Alexander Technique, two things which are fairly central to my current pursuit of emotional awareness and embodiment work. Focusing is using your bodily sense to learn about your emotional state, while this sort of graceful and effective movement is a key feature of Alexander Technique.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The other thing that is interesting in this link is the idea of "having fun". How do you know when you're having fun? This isn't a rhetorical question. What does "fun" feel like? &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know either to be honest. I'm not very good at fun. I can do interest, I can do spontaneity, I can enjoy things, but &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt; is weird for me. I'm hoping Focusing will help me unpack that a bit, by paying more attention to the phenomenological character of enjoyment and leaning into it a bit (and yes, I am aware that the fact that "How do I have fun? Let's learn more phenomenology!" is very much part of the problem. I am &lt;em&gt;not good&lt;/em&gt; at either of these cards, which is part of why they are interesting).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I suspect that fun is only visible to you after the fact. If you're too self-conscious about the fact that you're having fun, you'll forget to have fun. Overthinking is a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html"&gt;brake&lt;/a&gt; on your ability to have fun.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is part of why the two of pentacles puts me in mind of Alexander Technique. If fun is primarily an embodied state, then &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html"&gt;the half of you that is embodied&lt;/a&gt; is much more able to have fun than your cognitive half. Peter Nobes (my Alexander Technique) teacher relates a story of a standup comic: "Are there any intellectuals in the room? Raise your hand." (nobody raises their hand) "Good. Intellectuals don't know how to laugh. They just sit there and stroke their chin and go ah yes I see that's very funny". Highly relatable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the ways I have been deploying both sides of this recently - Focusing and Alexander Technique - is to try to have more fun doing exercise. Doing exercise not because I think I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; exercise, but because my body invites me to do so and to enjoy it. Using exercise as a way to engage with my embodied self, and to drop into a flow state. So far it hasn't resulted in a massive amount of exercise, but I've done some most days, and the amount I am doing seems to be going up over time rather than down, and at no point have I done any exercise and resented it.
This is pretty amazing, and makes me think there might be something to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html"&gt;this human notion of "fun"&lt;/a&gt; you people are always going on about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telling each other stories</title>
    <updated>2020-04-28T08:11:19+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Telling each other stories&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today's Tarot prompt is "&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj06.htm"&gt;The Lovers&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been writing a bunch about relationships recently, so I thought I'd investigate some of its other actions: Establishing personal beliefs and determining values.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This naturally leads me to revisit "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cObm3Y"&gt;Finding Our Sea-Legs&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From page 141:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this telling of tales, I do not entirely lose the story that I pass on; but neither do I keep hold of it in the same fashion as before. There is a gain and a loss. Both are inevitable, and a strict accounting of the two is impossible. Even if I sit in silence and listen to the stories of others, although at first glance it may seen that in hearing I only make gains, there are also losses, subtle losses: as I hear about another's sister-perhaps about her expertise in cooking aubergines-my own sister seems a greater or lesser aubergine cook than before; when I am told about the wolf, the traveler to my side once encountered on a lonely hillside, the wolf with which I exchanged glances one day in the municipal zoo transforms into a different wolf; and through these subtle, perhaps imperceptible changes in my sister or my wolf, so too I am changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Funnily, having gone from the lovers to values to finding our sea legs, we're back at a different meaning of the lovers: Relationships.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finding Our Sea-Legs is a book about stories, and their interplay with ethics and our experience of others. I &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-21-08:02.html"&gt;previously wrote about its focus on the phenomenology of ethics&lt;/a&gt;. This passage is more about the other "side" (in fact, the two are intimately related).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It makes me think about a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mutability of memory. When we recall our memories, we fundamentally change them, overwriting details. We think of memory as a fixed record of facts, but it's more like stories we tell ourselves and others, over and over again, subtly mutating each time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The way all observation is theory-laden. It's hard to separate facts from our interpretation of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As we tell each other stories, we each give each other new ways of looking at the world, and we cast other experiences in that light.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One way I have seen this happening over and over again is when we tell people how we conceptualise our lives, we give them new tools for interpreting theirs. There's the "There's a word for that" moment where you give someone a new hermeneutical resource (a tool for interpretation, such as a new word or conceptual framework. For example, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-11-12-06:24.html"&gt;information about trans or non-binary people&lt;/a&gt;, or learning about the link between ADHD and &lt;a href="https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-and-adhd/"&gt;rejection sensitive dysphoria&lt;/a&gt;), but you also see that in more subtle ways. For example, when you tell someone about an abusive behaviour in a relationship, this can cause them to recast similar things &lt;em&gt;they've&lt;/em&gt; experienced as abusive. The story didn't give them the concept of abuse, or teach them a new thing about their life, but it gave them the permission to recast the story of their life in new terms that they would not previously have.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When these sorts of events happen, they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; change our relationships with people - both past and present. Sometimes these changes are for the worse, realising how bad someone is for you, sometimes they are for the better, helping you realise how much someone means to you. Sometimes they give you new realisations and new directions to grow the relationship in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wrote previously about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html"&gt;growth relationships&lt;/a&gt;. I think many of my closest friendships are growth relationships in this sense, to some greater or lesser degree, and several such relationships have ended up as the foundation of our &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html"&gt;mutual support group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sort of back and forth is in many ways essential to support group. I've found many of the most useful conversations in support group for me have not been ones centered around problems I've brought to the group (though those have been helpful too - in a few cases, literally life changing) but the conversations we've had around other people's problems - both where I've helped them, and listening to others' advice. Hearing and understanding their stories has given me a new framework to look at my own life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In one sense, support group consists of getting together and helping each other solve our problems. In another, it is getting together and telling stories about our lives and building a shared interpretation of them. A great deal of why it works so well, and why relationships in general are such a great platform for growth, is that we are building a kind of shared canon of stories that we can build on - the Support Group Cinematic Universe so to speak - with which we can build our interpretive tools together, constantly deepening our understanding of our lives and the values we hold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Masculinity as a source of sexual hang ups</title>
    <updated>2020-04-27T18:28:27+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Masculinity as a source of sexual hang ups&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've decided I might start writing a second post on days where I feel like it and have otherwise managed to be productive, and had a relatively good day doing actual PhD writing today so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Card Draw: &lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/wqn.htm"&gt;Queen of Wands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of the actions, this prompted me to think about "Attractive" and "Self-Assured", which lead me to think of Mark Manson's book "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2xhqh7O"&gt;Models&lt;/a&gt;", which is about how to use self-confidence (the good kind) to become more attractive and successful in dating (It's a much better book than it might sound, but importantly this is the &lt;em&gt;revised&lt;/em&gt; edition. The original edition is apparently a much worse and more overtly pick up artist book).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From page 225:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The larger problem is not being completely comfortable with your sexuality and having sex. It's once again a vulnerability issue. This problem reaches much deeper and lurks within our subconscious. The most obvious solution is to simply have as much sex as possible. Getting a steady girlfriend is the best way to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First thought: Oh god why are so many of the randomisations forcing me to write incredibly uncomfortable and vulnerable pieces?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He's talking about sexual dysfunction ("not being able to get it up"), but I think the idea of "not being completely comfortable with your sexuality and having sex" is actually a very normal experience for men. Frankly I think the least plausible part of this entire paragraph is the idea that there's a statistically relevant audience of men who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; comfortable with their sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have this idea of male sexuality as being something that is fairly straightforward, but I don't think that's true. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-19-10:52.html"&gt;Masculininity training fucks you up&lt;/a&gt; and gives you a whole pile of hangups. Given how heavily our scripts for masculinity center on sex, a lot of those hangups are going to be about sex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the theme of attractiveness, I think this ties into a problem that I have previously written about, which is that it is often very hard for &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html"&gt;men to conceive of themself as physically attractive&lt;/a&gt;.
Sex is an opportunity to feel, temporarily, like you are an actual object of desire, in a way that we do not, generally, allow men an opportunity to experience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, I think by far the more common reason men have such emotional difficulties around sex is not around desire, but around shame, which is heavily tied into the masculine experience of sex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Men are supposed to be hypersexual, ready for sex at the drop of a hat, always up for it, and any deviation from that is a failure at being a man. Sex is that which validates your masculinity, so a failure to live up to this ideal of hypersexuality is a failure to be a man, failure to be a man is punished aggressively, and it's hard not to &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/"&gt;internalise those punishments&lt;/a&gt; as shame.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In Brene Brown's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2zsY3aG"&gt;Daring Greatly&lt;/a&gt;" (p. 102) she talks about male experiences of self-worth and sex. Quoting a young man from one of her group interviews:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we're really thinking is "Do you love me? Do you care about me? Do you want me? Am I important to you? Am I good enough?" That's what we're thinking. When it comes to sex, it feels like our life is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From another man in the group:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's true. When you want to be with us... in that way... it makes us feel more worthy. We standa a little taller. Believe in ourselves more. I don't know why, but it's true. And I've been married since I was eighteen. It still feels that way with my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And further:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[A therapist who had spent more than twenty-five years working with men] explained that from the time boys are eight to ten years old, they learn that initiate sex is their responsibility and that sexual rejection soon becomes the hallmark of masculine shame. He explained, "Even in my own life, when my wife isn't interested, I still have to battle feelings of shame. It doesn't matter if I intellectually understand why she's not in the mood. I'm vulnerable and it's very difficult."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of how this plays out in practice results in bad behaviour from men - if you feel shame when sexually rejected, it's easy to react in entitled ways (or, frankly, ways that are actually fine but read as entitled when taken against that broader backdrop) - so I don't necessarily expect a great deal of sympathy for men here, but if you can I'd like you to suspend that for now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One important thing to distinguish here is that men can experience this negative emotional response even without believing they are entitled to sex. This is very much a case where aliefs matter more than beliefs, and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html"&gt;aliefs are hard to change&lt;/a&gt;. If you've had it drummed into you that sexual rejection is a cause for shame, you will feel that shame no matter how much you have internalised healthy norms around consent. Being rejected can be a completely valid thing to do that you will respect to the hilt and still be a source of shame.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A result of this is that there is a lot of identity and emotion bound up in sex for men - in having it, and also being good at it. Failure at this is a trigger for shame, and so there is a significant internal pressure to "succeed" at sex. And pressure is a great way to engage the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html"&gt;brakes&lt;/a&gt;, so it's no wonder that a lot of men have performance anxiety, and that this leads to a failure to perform.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I feel the urge to comment on whether this applies to me personally and I'm going to resist that urge. Assume whatever you like.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that it's important to talk about all of this is that failure to live up to the stereotypes of masculine sexuality is actually very common, so when we fail to conform to them through perfectly normal individual variation we feel shame over that. This is then compounded when sexual partners, who have heard those same scripts, react badly to our failure to follow them - e.g. because they perceive it as a failure of desire on our part.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a key feature in which Mark Manson's advice is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad. Just getting yourself a girlfriend (or other sexual partner) is not a sufficient solution to the problem of working on your sexual hangups.
Getting a steady partner &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; very helpful for getting more comfortable with your sexuality, but it's not sufficient and may cause major problems if your partner has bought too much into the standard male sexual scripts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important, for people of any gender, that if you want to become comfortable with your sexuality you do so with a partner who is supportive of you, and with whom &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html"&gt;your relationship is a growth one&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to get over your discomfort with sex with a partner who is going to be pushy and judgmental in their reactions to your sexuality (especially to any failure to perform it "properly") will almost inevitably make things much worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;There is no moral obligation to be exhausted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Card Draw: &lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/s5.htm"&gt;The Five of Swords&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Five of Swords is about self-interest. Society tells us to think of others, yet we resist. How we can ignore our own concerns and still survive? This dilemma comes from our definition of self. If we view our self as our personality/body, our interests become those that relate to that self. Do I have enough to eat? Am I happy? Do I have all I want?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Entirely coincidentally, I had a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1254712803719610369"&gt;Twitter thread about self-interest&lt;/a&gt; yesterday:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking care of yourself is not selfish but is in fact essential for taking care of others. A thread of resources on this subject for as and when I find or remember them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an example to others (by me): https://drmaciver.com/2019/09/being-an-example-to-others/
If you take care of yourself then others around you will treat that as permission to take care of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unit of Caring on boundaries: https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/113029185206/a-meditation-on-boundaries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enforcing your own boundaries around what you want is good because it means that others around you don't have to constantly second guess your needs to avoid hurting you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do not prioritise your own recovery, the needs of those around you who are also recovering will burn you right back out. If everyone does this, nobody recovers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/quatoria/status/1253047417433395201&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This doesn't perfectly match the card, but definitely overlaps with it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Further card description:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may expand our concern to those we love, but, then, how can we stop there? We are connected to everyone in the long run. In truth, our self is the world. What we do to that world, we do to ourselves. This understanding is so basic, but so infuriatingly easy to forget day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In readings, the Five of Swords can mean that you or someone else is forgetting this larger view of self. You are defining your interests too narrowly. If you try to get ahead in isolation, your actions will come back to haunt you later, one way or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this card implies a need to put your own interests first. If you are being abused or taken advantage of, you must get free. If you are worn out by demands, take care of yourself. If it is your turn, step forward and claim your due. Just be aware that if you hurt others in the process, your victory will not feel complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm not yet quite sure what to do with this, so I decided to elaborate by drawing another card and got the &lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/s4.htm"&gt;Four of Swords&lt;/a&gt;. Rest, Contemplation, Quiet Preparation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This leads to a clear prompt I think, which is the need to conserve your own energy rather than spending all of it on others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Years ago, a friend made what I thought was an execellent point: If you have norms that you can only assert needs, not desires, then what you end up with is a social system that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html"&gt;skirts the edge of disaster&lt;/a&gt; in a specific way: Everyone is constantly, but not quite, on the edge of breaking. When you break, you are allowed to assert your needs, when you are not broken you are not "allowed" to say no.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As with other forms of skirting the edge of disaster, the solution is to move the edge. Whatever point we want people to typically be at is the point at which we need to be able to say no to more demands. If we want people to not be permanently exhausted, we need to be able to say no to demands before we become exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From Kelsey's article on boundaries:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I thought I was straight I would go on dates with boys. The boys would usually want to kiss me. I disliked kissing, but I thought that their preferences deserved to count as much as mine, and I reasoned that they probably liked kissing more than I disliked kissing. So kissing was a morally good thing to do. I also reasoned that if I told them I disliked the kissing then they’d feel guilty and enjoy it less. So I did not tell them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am certain I was making some kind of critical error but it has taken me a long time to figure out what it might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think one could easily translate this into spending energy on someone else: Often they will be more in need than you, so it feels internally valid to think that you should spend your energy on them because their need outweighs your need to not be exhausted. Even telling them that you are exhausted feels bad, because it is &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-xpm-2013-apr-07-la-oe-0407-silk-ring-theory-20130407-story.html"&gt;a violation of ring theory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But in fact, this is a bad norm. As well as leaving you burned out and exhausted, it will also cause the people who love you to be unwilling to ask you for help, because they cannot trust you to prioritise your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm going to try something experimental and take a random passage from a book I haven't read yet, which is "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3eZaStx"&gt;When I say no, I feel guilty&lt;/a&gt;" (Vathy &lt;a href="https://www.fvathynevgl.com/cooperative-spherical-cows/"&gt;recommended it a while back&lt;/a&gt; but I've only recently admitted that I will not read it as an ebook and acquired a physical copy).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I randomly selected page 231, which has the following dialogue between you and your hypothetical coworker, Harry:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HARRY: Boy, am I glad to see you! I got a real problem and I was afraid I couldn't get anyone to help me out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU: What's the problem?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HARRY: I need to use your car this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU: Umm. That is a problem, but I don't want to lend out my car this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HARRY: Why not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU: I agree you need it, but I just don't want to lend out my car this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HARRY: Do you have someplace to go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU: I may want it myself, Harry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HARRY: When do you need it? I'll get it back on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU: I'm sure you would, but I just don't want to lend out my car today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HARRY: Whenever I asked to borrow your car, you always lent it to me before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU: That's true, I did, didn't I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HARRY: Why won't you lend it to me today? I always took care of it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU: That's true, Harry, and I can see you're in a jam, but I just don't want to lend my car out today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this kind of boundary asserting behaviour is one that is very good to be able to do.
It feels a bit selfish, but selfishness is important if we're to be able to hold on to more than the bare essentials that we need.
When people ask you to spend your energy on them, you have to be able to say no.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;quatoria argued in her thread that survivor communities tend to burn each other out:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I implore other experienced survivors out there, who are just beginning the process of &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; recovery, of actual healing - BE CAREFUL with how you spend your time and energy, because so often one of us begins to heal and the overwhelming need around us drives us to burn out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this inability to assert your energetic boundaries is a large part of this. Recovery is treated as an obligation to help others recover, but if you do this too soon then the relationships formed around recovery are not &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html"&gt;growth relationships&lt;/a&gt; but instead &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/990138-she-reached-down-and-picked-a-crab-out-of-a"&gt;a crab bucket&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She reached down and picked a crab out of a bucket. As it came up it turned out that three more were hanging on to it. "A crab necklace?" giggled Juliet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oh, that's crabs for you," said Verity, disentangling the ones who had hitched a ride. "thick as planks, the lot of them. That's why you can keep them in a bucket without a lid. Any that tries to get out gets pulled back. Yes, as thick as planks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cWY3hR"&gt;Rewriting the Rules&lt;/a&gt;" MJB elaborates on the crab bucket metaphor:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Probably the main thing which prevents us from rewriting our rules is the crab bucket. The other crabs pull us back into the bucket if we show any sign of leaving, and the comfortable cosiness we find in the bucket means we're unlikely to go over the top on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Terry Pratchett, and the philosopher Michel Foucault, both point out, these days the crab bucket is rarely policed with a mallet. In most arenas it's not that we'll be hit over the head if we leave the bucket, as we would, for example, if we were LGBT in one of the coutnries which still consider that to be a crime. Rather, the crab bucket is policed by our own self-monitoring as we compare ourselves against each other, and try hard to be normal like everyone else - the other crabs. It's policed by the disapproval we fear because it'll reinforce our belief that we're really not okay. It's policed by ridicule, shame, and the fear of standing out from the crowd and being exposed as freakish, weird, or different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think prioritising the energetic needs is another way the crab bucket is policed: If you are not able to prioritise your own need to recover and conserve your energy over the needs of those around you, you will be permanently dragged back into the bucket by the fact that there are far more people in your circle of concern than you can possibly manage to save.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is another form of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;the social obligation to be bad at things&lt;/a&gt;. Doing better than those around you feels &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, so it becomes impossible to be good at things because as you try to improve you feel the obligation to drag the entire bucket of crabs up with you, which is far beyond your current strength. In fact, you would often do better by first escaping the bucket, and then helping the other crabs out of it one by one. By feeling overly beholden to the needs of others, we create a scenario where we are permanently vaguely miserable, and we also limit our ability to actually help others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wrote previously about the difference between &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html"&gt;morally obligatory and morally virtuous&lt;/a&gt;, which I think is illuminating here: Helping another person is morally virtuous, but in many cases we treat it as morally obligatory, as something that we &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do if we can.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In fact, however, it may not even be morally virtuous, because it universalises poorly. A moral norm where everyone puts their own oxygen mask on first is one where we can create communities in which people heal and prosper together, because it creates a communal path out of the crab bucket, one where people are able to be not just okay but actively happy, and then to pull others up after them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;The Casting of Leaders&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-29&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today's Card: The Magician:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Magician is the archetype of the active, masculine principle - the ultimate achiever. He symbolizes the power to tap universal forces and use them for creative purposes. Note his stance in the picture. He acts as a lightening rod - one arm extended up into the Divine for inspiration, the other pointing toward Earth to ground this potent energy. [note] His abilities appear magical at times because his will helps him achieve what seem to be miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes the Magician so powerful? First, he is not afraid to act. He believes in himself and is willing to put that belief on the line. He also knows what he intends to do and why. He doesn't hesitate because he understands his situation exactly. The Magician can focus with single-minded determination. As long as he remembers the divine source of his power, the Magician remains the perfect conduit for miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Susanna Clarke's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cYqmwd"&gt;Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel&lt;/a&gt;" is my natural association for magicians.
A random selection from it gives:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The old King is dead. The new King approaches! And at his approach the world sheds its sorrow. The sins of the old King dissolve like morning mist! The world assumes the character of the new. His virtues fill up the wood and the wold!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I've misplaced my physical copy, so this comes from a slightly dodgy PDF so no page number for now until a new copy arrives)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this scene, Stephen Black has killed The Man With The Thistledown Hair (yes this is really how he is referred to throughout the entire book). As a consequence of this, Stephen Black is now the new king of The Man With The Thistledown Hair's Faerie kingdom of Lost Hope. He intends to be a very different king:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This house," he told them at last, "is disordered and dirty. Its inhabitants have idled away
their days in pointless pleasures and in celebrations of past cruelties - things that ought not
to be remembered, let alone celebrated. I have often observed it and often regretted it. All
these faults, I shall in time set right."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't the main point I want to cover in this post, but a thing I can't help but noticing is that the interactions between Stephen Black and The Man With The Thistledown Hair are an interesting study in colonialism. Each is a member of a colonised people who has been shaped into a particular vision of what Englishness looks like, and each has deployed that Englishness against others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the case of The Man With The Thistledown Hair, he has spent the entire book tormenting Stephen Black by "helping" him in ways that are of no help whatsoever and mostly cause him distress, all the while ignoring what he wants and needs.
Principle among those is that he wants and needs The Man With The Thistledown Hair to &lt;em&gt;leave him alone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stephen Black, meanwhile, when given power over Faeries responses as the British (really, the English) have always done: By denigrating the local population as disordered, unclean, and slovenly, and in need of having some proper British values imposed upon them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(In the context of the story he is of course &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; that the Faerie are these things, but we are usually right in the version of the stories we tell, and Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is very English in its viewpoint).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The idea of the new king as the opportunity for the rebirth of society is an interesting one, and is in many ways how we view leaders more broadly. It typically fails in practice, because a leader is less important than the inertia of the system they lead, but we nevertheless persist in the idea that it is possible, and I think a lot of this is because of the role leaders serve for us as vessels into which we can pour our hopes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've recently finished reading James C. Scott's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YfwKer"&gt;The Art of Not Being Governed&lt;/a&gt;". Chapter 8, "Prophets of Renewal", is about how many of the recurring rebellions by the hill people of South East Asia against the valley dwelling padi states are lead by people styling themselves as prophets and miracle workers (magicians!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These miracle-workers are often themselves the subject of prophecy, the subject of utopian visions in which the oppressive state is replaced with a utopian one:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That a Karen King would yet appear.
The Talain [Mon] Kings have had their season
The Burmese Kings have had their season
ANd the foreign Kings will have their season
But the Karen King will yet appear
When the Karen King arriaves
There will only be one monarch
When the Karen King arrives
There will be neither rich nor poor
When the Karen King arrives
Every thing [creature] will be happy
Lions and leopards will lose their savageness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Please note that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people"&gt;the Karen in question&lt;/a&gt; have no desire to speak to your manager)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These prophecies are part of a general cultural impetus to rebellion and, as Scott puts it, "prophets are a dime a dozen". It is less that prophets create rebellions and more that prophets are created by the people they lead:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charisma is, above all, a specific cultural relationship between a would-be prophetic figure and his or her potential following. And because it is a relationship or an interpresonal resonance, we cannot claim that an individual has charisma in the same way we might say that someone has a gold coin in his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] a charismatic connection might be conceived as a specific congregation looking for a preacher whose message it can wholeheartedly embrace and whom it believes it can trust. It is as if the destination is largely known and specified (however ambitious it may be), and the congregation is in search of reliable transportation. The prophet is, in this sense, a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the society within which a successful prophet appears that, in effect, lays down the basic script that shapes the prophet's repertoise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us imagine a bard who lives exclusively by the voluntary contributions of ordinary people in the marketplace. And let us assume, for the sake of argument, that each of those who like what he sings gives him an identical small "copper." Having conjured up a bard who wants to please a large audience, let us further imagine that this bard has a repertoire of, say, a thousand songs and stories from which to select. Assuming that his audience has definite tastes, I imagine that, little by little, as the bard comes to know his audience, the actual songs he sings in the market square - perhaps even the order and style in which he sings them - will come to more closely approximate the distribution of tastes among his audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Rather than the prophets leading the the people into rebellion, prophets are a technology that the people use to achieve their goal of rebellion.
A &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-13-11:35.html"&gt;domus&lt;/a&gt; forms between the general memetic background of the people, their behaviour, and the behaviour of the prophet, with each shaping the others to be better suited to their needs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Scott is quick to point out that we do need to consider the individual prophets in this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[This analogy] allows too little for the creativity of the prophet and his capacity to add to the repertoire and to change tastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The prophet is absolutely a shaper of the rebellion, but what they are shaping is a kind of... filtering and simplification of the memetic background. A large body of knowledge and beliefs is being filtered through the prophet, and the prophet's job is to essentially distill it into a coherent and punchy narrative. The prophet is the elevator pitch for a larger body of cultural knowledge, and which of many potential prophets succeed is a function of how well they embody this role.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Though we can think of the prophet as the magician, like the two magicians of the book they are also the spell:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They have their faults, as other men do, but their achievements are still
remarkable. Make no mistake; I am John Uskglass's man. Or would be, if he were here. But
you must admit that the restoration of English magic is their work, not his."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Their work!" scoffed Vinculus. "Theirs? Do you still not understand? They are the spell John
Uskglass is doing. That is all they have ever been. And he is doing it now!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Strange and Norrell may be the spell cast by John Uskglass, but in many ways John Uskglass it not a person, but a personification. John Uskglass &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; English magic, in more sense than one: He is the codifier of it, but also English magic is grounded in his alliances with England. If Strange and Norrell are the spell cast by John Uskglass, John Uskglass is as much the spell cast by England.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Stephen Black, too, is ultimately the product of this sort of spellcraft. His rise to power comes off the back of a literal spell cast by Strange and Norrell that causes him to, temporarily, embody the power of English magic. Although he is no magician-king, his ability to channel the power of English magic is what grants him the ability to defeat The Man With The Thistledown Hair.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I cannot help but point out how interesting it is that English magic employed by English aristocrats is both what decides a conflict between two colonised people, and what brought them into conflict in the first place)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Prior to the casting of that spell, Stephen Black is a character distinctly lacking in agency. This isn't his fault, he's merely trapped by someone with significantly more power than him. Prior to that point, all he can do is appease and try to limit the damage that The Man With The Thistledown Hair can do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, once he is granted power, with it comes agency: He has the ability to act on that power, and he does.
He embodies the card of the Magician, and through his willingness to act becomes a conduit for miracles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, I think, is the other aspect of the role of prophet in a rebellion that it is important to acknowledge:
The prophet may be but the conduit for the power that cast them in this role,
but that power grants them a greater agency than they would otherwise possess, and it is that agency that allows them to make those choices.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In many ways, this increased agency is the purpose of the leader. The &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-24-09:38.html"&gt;basic unit of democracy is the discussion&lt;/a&gt;, and discussion is slow and ponderous.
The reason why we create and empower these leaders is not just to give &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; agency, but to experience that agency ourselves through them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This approach of course has many failure modes, and we're seeing many of those modes in the rise of populism, but it is an understandable desire, and a powerful social technology if we can use it safely. If we get good enough at that technology, perhaps it really will become indistinguishable from magic.&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2020-04-30T20:12:35+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Care Work and Fixing Things&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I ended up drawing a larger hand for inspiration today. In order of drawing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/pqn.htm"&gt;Queen of Pentacles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/ppg.htm"&gt;Page of Pentacles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/s3.htm"&gt;Three of Swords&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/w9.htm"&gt;Nine of Wands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/wa.htm"&gt;Ace of Wands&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To me, these seem to naturally organise themselves around the three of swords, which is a fairly negative card: Heartbreak, loneliness, betrayal, which I naturally want to connect up to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. People are certainly feeling lonely right now what with the disconnection of not seeing our loved ones. "Feeling isolated from those you love" is literally one of the meanings of the card.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Betrayal also feels apt. I've not been betrayed by anyone I love, but there is definitely a sense of being betrayed by the world and our institutions. Heartbreak? Maybe not literally, but the world definitely seems a swarm of negative emotions right now. This is definitely a COVID-19 card.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A friend who is rather more expert at tarot than I am pointed out a natural pairing: Queen of Pentacles with Nine of Wands, Page of Pentacles with Ace of Wands.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To me these pairings make me think of two sorts of practical orientations towards the world.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is what you might call &lt;em&gt;care work&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Pentacles is nurturing, resourceful, trustwothy. She takes care of others. She's practical, matter of fact, and trustworthy. She's very much a maternal figure, one you can imagine running a large family.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Queen of Pentacles does this out of a spirit of warmth and big-heartedness, a desire to nurture others, but I think the Nine of Wands reveals something of the truth of what such care actually looks like: Exhausting. The nine of wands represents defensiveness, perseverance, stamina. He's tired and wounded, but he persists. Defensive, cynical perhaps, but not angry. He may protect others as well as himself, but he's cautious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This combination makes me think of Pratchett's Witches.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2yV7Ztl"&gt;I Shall Wear Midnight&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I wish it wasn’t you doing this, Tiff. You’re not sixteen yet and I see you running around nursing people and bandaging people and who knows what chores. You shouldn’t have to be doing all of that.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, I know,’ said Tiffany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Why? ’ he asked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Because other people don’t, or won’t, or can’t, that’s why.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘But it’s not your business, is it?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I make it my business. I’m a witch. It’s what we do. When it’s nobody else’s business, it’s my business,’ Tiffany said quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, but we all thought it was going to be about whizzing around on brooms and suchlike, not cutting old ladies’ toenails for them.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘But people don’t understand what’s needed,’ said Tiffany. ‘It’s not that they are bad; it’s just that they don’t think. Take old Mrs Stocking, who’s got nothing in the world except her cat and a whole lot of arthritis. People were getting her a bite to eat often enough, that is true, but no one was noticing that her toenails were so long they were tangling up inside her boots and so she’d not been able to take them off for a year! People around here are OK when it comes to food and the occasional bunch of flowers, but they are not around when things get a little on the messy side. Witches notice these things. Oh, there’s a certain amount of whizzing about, that’s true enough, but mostly it’s only to get quickly to somewhere there is a mess.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father shook his head. ‘And you like doing this?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Why?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany had to think about this, her father’s eyes never leaving her face. ‘Well, Dad, you know how Granny Aching always used to say, “Feed them as is hungry, clothe them as is naked, and speak up for them as has no voices”? Well, I reckon there is room in there for “Grasp for them as can’t bend, reach for them as can’t stretch, wipe for them as can’t twist”, don’t you? And because sometimes you get a good day that makes up for all the bad days and, just for a moment, you hear the world turning,’ said Tiffany. ‘I can’t put it any other way.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her father looked at her with a kind of proud puzzlement. ‘And you think that’s worth it, do you?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, Dad!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Then I am proud of you, jiggit, you are doing a man’s job!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He’d used the pet name only the family knew, and so she kissed him politely and did not tell him that he was unlikely to see a man doing the job that she did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was listening to Journal Entries yesterday, in particular &lt;a href="https://journalentries.fireside.fm/ashton-and-mckenna"&gt;the entry about the paper situating feminist epistemology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/ASHSFE.pdf"&gt;the paper itself&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as affecting the evidence that they have access to, Hartsock argues that women’s experiences can also affect the way they weight the importance of different questions and activities. One example Hartsock provides, from Marilyn French’s novel The Women’s Room, makes this point especially vividly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washing the toilet used by three males, and the floor and walls around it, is, Mira thought, coming face to face with necessity. And that is why women were saner than men, did not come up with the mad, absurd schemes men developed; they were in touch with necessity, they had to wash the toilet bowl and floor (French 1978: 214).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea being captured here is that the roles women play in society affect the weight they give to different concerns and questions. There are some questions and topics that they don’t have the luxury of spending time and effort on (and others that they are vividly aware of the material importance of) because they have to clean up piss on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'll hold off on weighing in too strongly on the gender politics of this, but I think it is more than fair to say that carer roles are female coded, and care skews significantly female in numbers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The dual to care work is what you might think of as &lt;em&gt;fixing things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ace of wands is "Creative Force", "Enthusiasm", "Confidence", "Courage". Some actions suggested are "Inventing a better way", "being ready to tackle the world", "tackling a challenging task".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This pairs well with the page of pentacles: "Have an effect", "Be practical". "Mold the physical world".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Fixing things" is absolutely the essence of what French terms "the mad, absurd schemes men developed". It's a category with a very masculine coded energy to it. It's what you do when there is a big problem and something must be done to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Side note: I really doubt there's much if anything that makes one gender or another intrinsically better suited to these roles. It's mostly just &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/gendering/"&gt;gendering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html"&gt;culture&lt;/a&gt;. I do think the gendered aspect of these roles is important to pay attention to to understand how this plays out).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Care work and fixing things both exist to solve problems in the world that affect people. Fixing things is for big one off failures - they might fail again, sure, but they don't fail on any predictable schedule, or in exactly the same way. Each problem is big, and novel, and you need to figure it out and do something clever (but hopefully not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; clever) to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Care work, on the other hand, consists of fixing the endless grind of little problems which affect the world on a day to day basis. Problems that are important but unglamorous, and that will keep coming back over and over.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Care work is work that is centered on tasks you know you're going to have to do, while fixing things is centered on less predictable tasks that you only know are needed when something breaks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Care work is by no means unskilled, but one of its distinguishing features from fixing things is that once you have acquired the relevant skills you just have to do the work. There's no clever shortcuts, you just need to keep things up day in and day out. You'll gradually get more efficient as you learn what corners to cut, how to do individual tasks better, etc. but the savings are at best constant factors - they might make it significantly faster, but they don't fundamentally change the nature of the task.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, fixing things is very cleverness driven. You find the right &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-26-09:48.html"&gt;kludge&lt;/a&gt; or clever way of looking at the problem, and suddenly the whole thing cracks wide open.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A distinguishing feature of this is that care work looks less impressive than it is, and fixing things looks more impressive. Care work you look at and go "Pft, I could have done that" (you probably could, but you don't want to and also it would have taken you much longer and you'd have blown the time budget as a result), while fixing things you look at and go "Wow, I could never have done that" (you probably could, they just invested a lot of time and effort to develop a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-12-11:35.html"&gt;good intution&lt;/a&gt; on the subject).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do sometimes suspect that there is a discounting in the other direction too: We treat care work as exhausting, and fixing things as fun and creative, but I do notice (among other things) how much burnout there is in software developers and suspect a great deal of this is that the relative ease of any given fix compared to the endless toil of care work causes us to discount the hidden costs of context switching and constantly fighting new and unique fires each time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general I think there's a risk that whichever one you think is most important, you tend to discount the other, because each of these things is hard in very different ways. Carers think of fixers as lazy, and fixers think of carers as stupid. They're both wrong of course.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is definitely a credit gap, where we over valorise fixing and under valorise care. There is, I think, no doubt that this is the case, and little doubt that the way we gender the relevant tasks and skills is a major part of that. One of the major things we are seeing in the COVID-19 crisis is how many things that are care work in this sense are critical in a way that was not previously appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We are also, however, also seeing the need for fixing things. The systems we live in our breaking in all sorts of new and exciting ways. We're seeing people adapting creatively, finding &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-07-10:05.html"&gt;new ways to use things&lt;/a&gt;, adapting and figuring out new things on the fly as we find new problems and new ways things are broken.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We're also seeing this at the larger level: The basic response to the disease demonstrably needs both parts. We need both to take care of people as and when they get ill, and we also need new solutions to try to ultimately solve the problem. Focusing on either to the exclusion of the other would be a mistake, and it would be a mistake that potentially kills hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of this is, I think, going to involve acknowledging that this dichotomy between the two skill sets is rather blurrier than we often pretend it is - there's no sharp line at which you go from care work to fixing things, and each includes some of the other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another part is going to be to learn to value the skill set of the other side, and acknowledge that each has different tasks and difficulties, and without both being well handled the whole system falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A way I've seen this personally is figuring out what a valuable help customer service people can be to software development. Customer service is very much care work - most of it is just talking to people, hand holding, answering the same basic questions over and over again. It is, as French puts it, "coming face to face with necessity", and as a result they understand how actual users use the system, and this is an expertise that as your coworker you can draw upon through the simple expedient of treating them with respect and asking them questions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They, too, can draw on you and your expertise, because as a developer you have the ability to change the system, so they can just come to you with problems and you can fix those problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ideal, of course, would be that everybody would be amazing at both care work and fixing things, but I think the reality is that this is impossible. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-15-12:24.html"&gt;Berkson's paradox&lt;/a&gt; is probably causing me to overestimate its difficult, but ultimately both are hard skillsets that take a long time to acquire, and don't overlap &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much (although in order to peak at either &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html"&gt;you probably have to learn some of the other&lt;/a&gt;), so it's worth a certain amount of specialisation despite the overlapping skill sets, and given that we should learn to treat each side with respect, and to learn the &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2015/02/what-are-developer-adjacent-skills/"&gt;skills adjacent to&lt;/a&gt; the other way of working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Ritual and Freedom&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-01&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cards:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj19.htm"&gt;The Sun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/p9.htm"&gt;The Nine of Pentacles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj03.htm"&gt;The Empress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I drew the nine of pentacles first and my reaction was an instant dislike, so I drew another two cards to see if they could help me make sense of this a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Nine of Pentacles and the Empress are in natural opposition to each other. The nine represents discipline and refinement, in opposition to the Empress's focus on luxury and the senses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I dislike the Nine of Pentacles so much is how relatable she is. Not necessarily as an internal experience, but as a role in which I am cast. I am &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a disciplined person, but I often come across that way as part of &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/11/reaching-into-the-whirlwind/"&gt;my attempts to claw back some structure out of a disordered internal world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One part where the Nine of Pentacles is internally relatable is that I'm definitely a &lt;em&gt;controlled&lt;/em&gt; person, in the sense that I have a lot of my emotions far too tightly held. This is very much in opposition to the Empress, whose role is more about getting in touch with abundance and our feelings. This is something I am actively working on, as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-12:07.html"&gt;I wrote before&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways I have been deploying both sides of this recently - Focusing and Alexander Technique - is to try to have more fun doing exercise. Doing exercise not because I think I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; exercise, but because my body invites me to do so and to enjoy it. Using exercise as a way to engage with my embodied self, and to drop into a flow state. So far it hasn't resulted in a massive amount of exercise, but I've done some most days, and the amount I am doing seems to be going up over time rather than down, and at no point have I done any exercise and resented it.
This is pretty amazing, and makes me think there might be something to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html"&gt;this human notion of "fun"&lt;/a&gt; you people are always going on about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Sun can be taken to represent enlightenment, insight, and understanding. Finding the sense behind the chaos, attaining a new level of insight.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unlearning Meditation, p 95 (The Sun):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many impasses are made up of concepts and the mental constructs built up around them, and those are harder to become aware of than the ones that just pertain to meditation practice. The constructs may have to do with beliefs about reality, about the nature of existence, the truth of things, and so forth. They may also be personal narratives about your life or the people in it. They may also be reasons, justifications, and explanations for various behaviours and attitudes that have been running your life from behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Defined earlier (p 73):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An impasse is "a predicament affording no obvious escape" according to &lt;em&gt;Webster's Third New International Dictionary&lt;/em&gt;. Using that definition, one would find oneself at an impasse in meditation when there is no "obvious" way of going through something. All of the usual methods, the bright ideas and good advice, the right-sounding strategies and correc tbeliefs, don't help one go through with something that one is stuck in, one's "predicament." There is a caged feeling around such impasses. You have come face-to-face with your limitations, your ignorance, your lack of creativity, inventiveness, or insight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Unlearning meditation" is a very "&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html"&gt;fixing things&lt;/a&gt;" approach to meditation. You reach an impasse, and you fix it through cleverness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ritual and its Consequences, p 25-26 (The Nine of Pentacles), quoting Johnathan Z. Smith:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, I believe, an essential truth to the old interpretation of "sympathetic magic" as an "offensive against the objective world" but that the wrong consequences were deduced. It is not that "magical" rituals compel the world through representation and manipulation; rather they express a realistic assessment of the fact that the world cannot be compelled"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest that, among other things, ritual represents the creation of a controlled environment where the variables (i.e. the accidents) of ordinary life may be displaced precisely because they are felt to be so overwhelmingly present and powerful. Ritual is a means of performing the way things out to be in conscious tension to the way things are in such a way that this ritualized perfection is recollected in the ordinary, uncontrolled course of things. Ritual relies for its power on the fact that it is concerned with quite ordinary activities, that what it describes and displays is, in principle, possible for every occurrence of these acts. But it relies, as well, for its power on the perceived fact that, in actuality, such possibilities cannot be realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is not the argument of the book itself, as they clarify shortly:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a friendly amendment to Smith's argument may also be called for. Smith's attempt to save ritual practitioners from being read as prerational actors may have led him to go too far in emphasizing the cognitive aspects of incongruity - that ritual works because it allows the practitioners to think about the disjunction between ritualperformance and the real world. But it is important to note that ritual is not necessarily - or even primarily - something one thinks about. Indeed, if we take Smith's emphasis on incongruity seriously, it may actually help point us away from such a cognitive reading of ritual and toward one focusing more on the active, and endless, work on ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The emphasis on "the endless work of ritual" makes me think that in contrast to Unlearning Meditation's "fixing things" attitude, ritual is care work. In this view the antidote to an impasse is not to be clever and overcome some obstacle, but to repeatedly and insistently do the work. Many meditation practices are indeed like that (it's part of why I don't get on with them).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core feature of ritual, the book argues, is that it is a collective creation of "a subjunctive world" - an illusion in which we behave &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; some thing is true. Courtesy behaviours (please and thank you) are, for example, are rituals acting in a subjunctive world of equality and free choice, in which everyone behaves as equals freely choosing to help each other. Religious rituals exist in the subjunctive world where the religious cosmology is true.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In Smith's vision of this, it is the fact that the subjunctive world is false that is key to the ritual, but in the vision of "Ritual and its Consequences" the factuality of the subjunctive world is, if not irrelevant, not the primary point. The purpose of the ritual is the ritual itself, and the world it allows us to operate in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By learning to operate in this subjective world, we create an extension of ritual outside of its more specific forms (p 34):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the point of view of what we have been calling a Protestant framework, ritual behaviour often appears as a submission of humans to external norms - as a rejection of autonomy. Ritual, from such a point of view, consists of discipline and constraint, whereas sincerity is a turn inward toward the true self. From the point of view of a ritual order, whowever, this is not the case at all: a ritual order does not assume that all action is or even necessarily should be a repetition of rituals from the past. By definition, most action is not. The point is that, ideally, such actions should, in a sense, be ritual without ritual precedent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Holy Foucault, Batman.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am put in mind of the following passage from Nora Bateson's "Small Arcs of Larger Circles" (p73-74). Her son has been having nightmares about zombies, and has been acting up in school. These are related.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What's a zombie? Well, in his words:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"zombies are people who cannot think for themselves, they want you to be like them. ...And, if you do what they say, your dignity flies out the window."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So Bateson makes the following suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevor is an actor, and he was already studying performance at the time. So I offered him his first paid acting job. I promised him 100 dollars to play the part of the Straight-A student until the end of the school year, (it was already February). If he could play that part the zombies would be fooled into thinking that they could stop trying to control him. Hopefully he would have some peace. But, I had one caveat: that he never, ever, ever believe that he actually was that Straight-A student the world wanted him to be. I said "Play the part, but I want my Trevor for a son, not a zombie."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bateson seems very proud of her cunning plan, to such a degree that she appears to have missed that she has conned her son into becoming a zombie.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is that &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/"&gt;you cannot norm to a group without a certain amount of internalising its ideals&lt;/a&gt;. If you put on the mask, the mask will eventually become your face, because you will have learned the skill set of performing in that group, and your skills performing outside of that role will atrophy. More, you will internalise the idea that stepping out of that role will get you punished, leaving you with a comfort zone that is sharply defined by the role you have learned to play.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Focusing-Oriented Psychotherapy, p 285 (The Empress):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In therapy the interaction should not too often duplicate the common childhood type in which someone defines reality for the client, and the client is supposed to listen. Everyone has had that kind of interaction with parents, teachers, experts, overweening friends, perhaps also with unskilled therapists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such an interaction &lt;em&gt;the other person&lt;/em&gt; is active, animated, perceiving clearly, explaining clearly, taking up space, defining the world, moving ahead - just the interactional modes that the client needs to discover. Meanwhile the client is passive, is impinged upon, is expected to listen and put away thoughts and feelings that are already there, pushing them back, crowding everything in further so as to make room for what is being expressed, then to wait till the other comes to the point, follow the other's reasoning, and see the other's good sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This defining of reality for you is in many ways the &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of pervasive ritual. We are very much creatures who share our cognition, outsourcing as much of our thinking and behaviour to the people and world around us as we can get away with.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of what I'm trying to navigate is figuring out &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html"&gt;the synthesis between different sides of our self&lt;/a&gt;. Generally speaking, whenever you orient human experience between two extremes, you find that both of the extremes are a bit pathological, and healthy behaviour looks like not being stuck.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there's a problem with this when it comes to discipline vs free expression of emotions: By its nature, discipline once acquired is a hard skill to turn off. Its mere presence is an inhibiting factor - consider a man pointing a gun at you. The man does not have to ever fire the gun to use it to control your behaviour, because the threat of being shot is sufficient. Once you have internalised the skills and norms of discipline, you are ever under its control, because your free expression is limited by the fact that if it ever gets too much (and what counts as "too much" is very much defined by external norms that you have internalised), you will act and bring it into line.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Ritual and its Consequences" defines ritual as in opposition to &lt;em&gt;sincerity&lt;/em&gt;. From page 14:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerity imagines a world "as is" instead of ritual's multiple worlds of "as if." It looks to discursive meanings and unique selves instead of repeated acts and fragmented realities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Frankly, speaking as someone vaguely on the autistic spectrum, the idea that the majority of human culture views the world &lt;em&gt;as it is&lt;/em&gt; seems very implausible to me. It's possible the authors will get more into this later (I'm only part of the way through the book), but I think the authors are perhaps confusing a widely shared intersubjective world with objective reality. The issue is less that we are focused on a single world as it is and more that we have adopted a single ritual world to the exclusion of all others. We've demanded excessive coherency, not with reality, but with each other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, the antidote is perhaps the same, in that we can counterbalance the norming effect of rituals with more rituals that we can switch between.
If ritual got us into this mess, perhaps ritual can also get us out of it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From "Invitation to Personal Construct Psychology", p 114, the chapter "Can You Really Hypnotise People?":&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So make-believe, the world of "as if", affords us, in everyday life, opportunities to go beyond the confines of our immediate circumstances, to explore corners of our souls we hide from the world, to elaborate and give full weight to aspects of ourselves we often cannont safely explore in our day-to-day lives. This lack of 'safety' exists perhaps in the form of social constraints on some kinds of behaviour, or it may take the form of the threat and insecurity we feel when we consider the possibility of being a different kind of person. Perhaps we see ourselves as 'submissive' and would like to be more 'assertive'. But the costs are dear, in real life, of gaily throwing off our familiar ways of being and stepping into ... who knows what? Who has not, in imagination, 'practised' some confrontational encounter, playing out in their mind's eye the possibilities of different scenarios. So the first point we are making is that the world of 'as if' is an important part of our normal lives, and affords us opportunities for safe exploration which are of benefit to us in tackling life's problems, from returning faulty merchandise to becoming a more confident person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To return to the issue of hypnosis, the link here is that research from a variety of sources has demonstrated that 'good' subjects, people who seem able to make best use of hypnotic suggestions and easily experience the suggested effects, are doing so by the use of the same kinds of imaginative strategies. The good subject enters into the make-believe spirit of hypnotic suggestion uncritically, and under this 'safe umbrellla' freely allows themselves to explore the possibilities for thought, feeling and experience that the hypontist (like the author) suggests. So we are now at a point of seeing hypnosis not as something abnormal and unusual, but as the harnessing of a mode of thought or psychological functioning which is part of our normal, everyday lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this scenario, hypnosis serves as a ritual playing a very different role from becoming a zombie, in that instead of creating an all encompassing subjunctive world in which you must behave &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; the rules of society were absolute, it creates a much smaller world in which you are temporarily given &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html"&gt;permission&lt;/a&gt; to take off those strictures imposed upon you by society and explore an aspect of yourself that you would normally keep hiding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We in fact have many of these ritual forms in daily life. For example, social drinking of alcohol is such a ritual. Much of drunkenness is socially constructed ritual: Alcohol certainly has a physiological and psychological effect on us, but little of the actual behaviour of drunkenness is that effect. Instead it is a shared illusion, entering into a world where we behave &lt;em&gt;as if&lt;/em&gt; we can be more free with our feelings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Therapy is another example. In many cases the therapist is no more useful than a rubber duck (in many cases they are much more useful of course), but a significant part of the use of therapy is that it lets you enter into a space where you can talk about and attempt to solve your problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If the threat of our own discipline is what prevents us from embracing the freedom of our own emotions, then these sorts of ritual spaces can create the possibility of disarmament. The way to be free is not to reject discipline and ritual, but instead to use them to construct ways of being that give us the freedoms that we want.&lt;/p&gt;
