&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Your emotions are valid but probably wrong&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-03&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a follow on from &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;Emotional reactions as legacy code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Premises:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All emotional reactions serve a purpose. They are designed to get you into a particular mode of thinking and acting in response to some stimulus that makes that seem like a good idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned emotional reactions do not go away on their own, and most people do not have the skillset for making them go away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignoring or arguing with your emotions as "bad" will typically not help and may intensify them, because they will still feel relevant and will respond to the fact that you're ignoring them when they're needed by rising to a level which you can't ignore. (Going very dissociative seems partially protective against this but has its own set of problems, guess how I know).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, we can conclude:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your emotions are valid, in the sense that invalidating them is the worst thing you can do if you want to respond to situations more healthily.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your emotions are usually wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason for this is simple: Childhood is very different from adulthood, and you learned many of your emotional reactions in childhood. Those early learned emotional reactions will have had a long time to bed in - either you've been embracing them, and learned that that works, or you've tried to ignore them, and they've intensified to stop you from doing that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those emotional reactions you're having from childhood? They were adaptive when you learned them. They weren't necessarily &lt;em&gt;good ideas&lt;/em&gt; when you learned them (e.g. you might have learned that getting angry and screaming would get you attention. It probably wasn't ever a good way to get attention), but they filled a functional role.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is that your adult environment is very different from your childhood one:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are surrounded by different (and often much better) people than you were in childhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have significantly more agency and power than you did in childhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have significantly more skills and competence than you did in childhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In most circumstances where things are bad &lt;em&gt;you can leave&lt;/em&gt; (this isn't always true, but it's true more often than people treat it as being).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This environment is so different from most people's experiences of childhood that it's &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; unlikely that the strategies that were adaptive as a kid are still adaptive as an adult, but unless you relearn the emotional reactions you've inherited from your child self, you will behave in very maladaptive ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For a personal example, for me school was a living hell. I was the weird kid, I found everyone else completely unrelatable, I had no communication or emotional skills. It was awful and I was stuck there and there was nothing I could do about that because every attempt to improve my situation made it worse, so I was utterly powerless. I really cannot recommend anything about the experience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, as an adult, I have wonderful friends who I find &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; relatable. I'm still weird, but in ways that are very compatible with those around me. I have a fair bit of social status (again, in my wonderfully weird niche communities), I'm almost certainly in the top 10% of the population as far as emotional and communication skills go (in some respects I'm much higher, in some respects I've still got a lot of learning to do, so this is a complicated claim to make, but I think top 10% is true by any reasonable metric), and if someone or something is causing me trouble I can usually exit the situation, or modify it to work better for me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result is a degree of agency that I am totally emotionally unprepared for by my childhood experiences, and I constantly have to retrain my emotional reactions to remind myself of that. Fortunately this is invigorating rather than exhausting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Skirting the edge of disaster</title>
    <updated>2020-03-04T11:34:37+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Skirting the edge of disaster&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-04&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Have you ever looked at a system and marvelled at the fact that it works at all?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course you have, you are one. You also work at one, live in one, if you're in London you certainly commute on one.
Complex systems are a mess and the only reason we can believe that they work is that they, somehow, do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's a boundary defined between two competing forces:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If an important system is broken, we fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a system has spare capacity, we place more demands on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Any system subject to these forces will skirt the edge of disaster: It will constantly be on the verge of being broken, and yet somehow work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason is very simple: If the system is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; on the edge of disaster, it will either be currently broken, and move towards the edge by getting better, or it will currently be under capacity and more demands will be put on it, and move towards the edge by getting worse. The edge is the only point of equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The best way to fix this that seems in widespread use is not to try and remove this dynamic, but instead to &lt;em&gt;move the edge&lt;/em&gt;, by changing what counts as a problem that needs fixing.
You still skirt the edge of "disaster" but your definition of disaster is now that the system is working suboptimally instead of just broken.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One way in particular to do that is to treat situations in which disaster was plausible rather than actual (near misses) as things that need fixing in their own right. &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758026/pdf/v012p00465.pdf"&gt;Learning from samples of one or fewer&lt;/a&gt; is a good paper about this, describing how organisations can learn to avoid low probability high cost events which they, thankfully, not yet actually experienced.
Experiencing &lt;em&gt;near misses&lt;/em&gt; as things to learn from and feed back into the system is a key part of this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seeking out existence proofs in everyday life</title>
    <updated>2020-03-05T11:44:07+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Seeking out existence proofs in everyday life&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-05&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When trying to solve a problem, it is worth separating out two things:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can I solve this problem to a level that is useful?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it even possible to solve this problem at all?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An example that I think of a lot is Hypothesis and the way it integrates test-case reduction into generation.
The idea isn't novel to me, although some of the details and most of the engineering are,
but unlike previous attempts at achieving this sort of integrated test-case reduction it actually worked.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing that allowed me to do it was that I knew something like it could work, because I had already demonstrated that the thing that it was doing was possible with a previous, much worse, version.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am slightly embarrassed at having shipped that version to production. It was awful. It was buggy, overcomplicated, and offence against good taste. But it &lt;em&gt;worked&lt;/em&gt;, and that gave me both the knowledge that what I was trying to do could be done, and helped me get a rough sense of that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another example: Skill development. I was talking to a friend who does climbing, and she was relating an experience she had at practicing jumps during climbs. This was one of the big &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html"&gt;constraints on her skill growth&lt;/a&gt;, because she's quite short so needed to be able to jump to traverse some routes, and she wasn't making progress on it.
Eventually she realised that part of the problem was that actually she had literally just never jumped and caught something and supported her whole weight on it, and she was worried about it hurting or even dislocating her arms (not a rational fear, which she knew, but an understandable one).
So she practiced jumping and grabbing on to a pullup bar. Turns out, arms are pretty robust, and now she knew the thing she was trying to do was possible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yet another example: Emotional range is a thing that I'm working on. Mine is quite restricted, and I don't like it. Turns out "restricted emotional range" is a long way of saying "depression". So I'm working on the skill of having emotions (yes it's a skill, shut up). But this is hard if you don't know what emotions are supposed to feel like,
so it's worth doing a bit of experimenting in order to try to induce specific emotional states.
Cuddle a cat and really narrow in on what that's like to experience contentment, play untitled goose game to experience malicious glee, get really high to experience joy (disclaimer: First travel to somewhere where weed is legal. May I recommend Amsterdam if you're in Europe? But don't be a dick about it. They're bored of high tourists).
These are not sustainable ways to experience those emotions all the time, but they're great for demonstrating to you that it is possible to feel those emotions,
which is great for being able to find your way back to them the hard way (and can be refreshed every now and then if you forget what it's like).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think of these things as &lt;em&gt;existence proofs&lt;/em&gt;, because I'm a maths nerd.
They don't help you construct a specific example, but they let you know that such an example must exist,
and that you're not wasting your time chasing something that is logically impossible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also think of it as looking for feasible solutions in an optimisation problem (or &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/10/vocabulary-building-satisficing/"&gt;a satisficing problem&lt;/a&gt;). First, solve the problem any which way, then worry about improving that solution into one you'd actually be happy to use.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Depression as felt restriction on emotional range</title>
    <updated>2020-03-06T09:50:18+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Depression as felt restriction on emotional range&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-06&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2IpgbDS"&gt;Experiences of Depression&lt;/a&gt; Matthew Ratcliffe does a great analysis of what it's &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; to be depressed. Key to his analysis is a distinction between &lt;em&gt;intentional&lt;/em&gt; feelings ("intentional" meaning "about something" rather than "deliberate". It's a philosopher thing. I often use "about" instead of "intentional") and &lt;em&gt;existential&lt;/em&gt; feelings, which are more pervasive feelings that colour your existence rather than being about one specific thing.
You could think of these as feelings-about (intentional feelings) and feelings-of (existential feelings) if that helps.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many of the feelings of depression are existential rather than intentional, which is why it is so frustrating when people ask you what you are depressed &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt;. You're not depressed about anything, because the feelings that make up your depression are existential ones, which lack aboutness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the types of existential feelings that seems most central to depression are ones concerning &lt;em&gt;restricted emotional range&lt;/em&gt;.
A central example of this is hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Hope" is an intentional feeling. You hope &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; something. Hope has an intrinsic aboutness to it.
Hopelessness on the other hand, is an existential one: It is more than merely a lack of hope, it is a feeling that hope is impossible.
You can lack any particular hope without feeling hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It may be helpful to think of it as like being stuck. Feeling stuck is more than just the absence of movement. You can be non-moving without feeling stuck. Stuckness is the idea that movement is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In Minksy's &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/39wOsg8"&gt;The Emotion Machine&lt;/a&gt; he talks about emotions as ways of thinking, and how one of the various systems that regulates our emotional experience are &lt;em&gt;critics&lt;/em&gt; which are designed to protectively limit our thoughts and actions based on past experience. He suggests (p. 82) that there are at least three types of critic:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Corrector declares that you are doing something dangerous.
  "You must stop right now, because you're moving your hand toward aflame."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Suppressor interrupts before you begin the action you're planning to take.
  "Don't start to move your hand toward that flame, lest it get burned."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Censor acts yet earlier, to prevent that idea from occurring to you -
  so you never even consider the option of moving your hand in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I don't necessarily buy Minsky's models in this book as 100% true, but I find them useful metaphors)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'd suggest that it is useful to think of hopelessness and similar as the felt sense of a censor (a felt censor, so to speak).
A censor is active that is preventing certain emotions from activating,
and you can &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; that that censor is there,
and that feeling is an integral feature of the depressive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerding</title>
    <updated>2020-03-07T08:47:25+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Nerding&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Definitions are gauche, but I'm going to attempt a definition of "nerd".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Prompts:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1234959895486660609"&gt;Me getting mad on the internet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am utterly baffled by the question "What are some things you love that aren't nerd-related?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you mean things that are not nerd related? Everything is nerd related. Nerd is a way to relate to a subject, not a property of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another prompt is the recent run of &lt;a href="https://www.egscomics.com/comic/party-126"&gt;El Goonish Shive&lt;/a&gt; where this is a topic of conversation (yes I read EGS, no I'm not embarrassed about this. It's fun. Shush).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the definition I would like to propose is this: Nerding is being interested in a subject for intrinsic reasons, rather than for anything that that subject can bring you.
It's a way of engaging with the subject where if someone asks you why you're spending so much time on it, any answer you give other than "Because it's &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt;" would be a rationalisation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm going to use &lt;em&gt;grounding&lt;/em&gt; as the antonym for nerding - that is, engaging with a subject as interesting for &lt;em&gt;extrinsic&lt;/em&gt; reasons. Grounding is what you do when you want to get shit done with the subject. The strategy I outlined in &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/08/how-did-you-get-started-so-quickly/"&gt;how to quickly become effective&lt;/a&gt; is a grounding strategy - you don't avoid learning about the subject, but your learning is very much directed towards a specific goal,
and the subject is secondary.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I'm not at all happy with "grounding" as a term and reserve the right to replace it with something better later)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My interest in cooking is grounding, because it's primarily driven by a need to eat and a desire to eat tasty things. My interest in voting systems is about 90% nerding, because although I occasionally use it in practical ways it's primarily driven by the fact that voting systems are intrinsically interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, the distinguishing feature of nerding about a subject is that you know far more about it than is reasonable for what you need.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Virtually everyone nerds at least a bit. Unless you are fundamentally incurious about the world, you're going to find out stuff just because you find it interesting. In the same way that you can write without being a writer, you can nerd without being a nerd. Nerds are just those of us with a strong tendency to nerd, and for whom that is an important part of our identity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People think of some subjects as nerdier than others, and it's probably true that some subjects are intrinsically more suitable for nerding about, but people nerd about all sorts of things. I'm nerding about communication and emotional processing skills at the moment. I have a friend who is a dedicated sex nerd. Sports nerds are everywhere. The best bartenders I know are drinks nerds. Chefs are &lt;em&gt;certainly&lt;/em&gt; food nerds. It's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to find subjects that nobody nerds about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nerding often arises after grounding. You pick up a subject because you need it for stuff, and then you find some aspect of it &lt;em&gt;fascinating&lt;/em&gt; and you're just kinda hooked. Again, voting theory was this for me - I got interested because of the UK referendum on electoral reform. Test-case reduction is another one. Actually &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of my nerding arises this way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing about being a nerd about a subject is that it often unlocks levels of practical functional capability that are useful to everyone, even when they're grounding.
Because you spend so much time thinking about it, your personal (or social) ecosystem of thoughts and ideas around the material is so much richer than that of someone who is just functionally interested in it.
It means that when you have a concrete problem to deal with, you have a whole set of tools that are ready to hand that you can apply to it that nobody who wasn't intrinsically interested in the subject would have bothered to acquire.
This means that nerding is often a necessary step to making real, practical, progress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Of course, someone whose interest in a subject is 100% nerding will often go off in a weird useless direction that has no practical applications. That's fine too, but progress requires a certain mix of grounding and nerding).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because of this I often do what I call &lt;em&gt;nerd raiding&lt;/em&gt; - when I have a subject where my interest in it is mostly grounding, I still go seek out the subject nerds so that I can steal their good ideas, because often there's enough material in there that they arrived at the hard way that I can just package up and use without doing the same level of work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can't actually run out of ideas</title>
    <updated>2020-03-07T11:30:41+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;You can't actually run out of ideas&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can't actually run out of ideas, because ideas are generated not found.
The way to get more ideas is just to work at it, and if you're struggling it's probably because you're approaching the problem wrong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let me tell you about two books.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first book is de Bono's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/38y5E3H"&gt;Lateral Thinking&lt;/a&gt;". This book is annoyingly good. By which I mean this book is good, and that's annoying.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is Steven Johnson's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2TvxGIV"&gt;Where Good Ideas Come From&lt;/a&gt;", which is about innovation in the world but also works just as well at a more personal scale.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;De Bono's argument is that there are essentially two types of thinking: Lateral and vertical. I tend to think of the split as more lateral and critical: &lt;em&gt;generating&lt;/em&gt; ideas and &lt;em&gt;ensuring that your ideas are good&lt;/em&gt; as separated tasks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Steven Johnson's argument is that ideas are an evolutionary process.
Ideas build on other ideas, through combination, mutation, variation.
Exaptation happens and ideas are bothered from other contexts.
Selection pressure happens when ideas hit the real world and you find out if they actually &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;.
At any given point, you have the ever growing adjacent possible - the set of ideas it's currently possible to have, based on the set of ideas that have already been had and developed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is how it works on the inside as well: You have your own personal version of the adjacent possible, which is ever expanding, and which contains all the potential ideas you could have.
Having ideas is about exploring that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are failing to explore the adjacent possibly to your satisfaction, there's probably a very simple reason for that: You're trying to not have bad ideas, when you should be trying to have good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bad ideas are great. Having bad ideas is &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; fun. You can toy with them, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html"&gt;nerd out about them&lt;/a&gt;, and you can &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;learn from them&lt;/a&gt;.
You need to be careful about &lt;em&gt;implementing&lt;/em&gt; them, especially at scale, but &lt;em&gt;having&lt;/em&gt; them is a harmless and necessary part of the idea generation process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is especially true because they provide grounding for your adjacent possible. Bad ideas can generate good ideas, because they act as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html"&gt;existence proofs&lt;/a&gt; that show you what a solution &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; look like, and you can riff off that to generate good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You will never get the benefit of this if you are integrating critical thinking too early in the process, because you are &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html"&gt;censoring&lt;/a&gt; a critical part of the process.
Reproduction and selection are &lt;em&gt;separate parts&lt;/em&gt; of the evolution of ideas, and if you try to integrate them too tightly your idea generation process will feel unneccessarily difficult.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I recommend both of the books I mentioned, but especially de Bono's lateral thinking book.
However, I can tell you the most useful idea in the book in one sentence:
When you want to generate ideas, give yourself a prompt (ways to do X, Y, Z), decide how many you want (fifty is a good number, but start with ten if you're unsure), and write down that many ideas. They can be ridiculous, they can certainly be bad, they don't have to be things you'd want to do or even could do, they just have to be ideas attached to the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After you've done that, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; is the time to mine through the ideas to see if there's anything interesting there, but until you've actually generated the ideas there's no point being too critical.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COULDDO vs TODO</title>
    <updated>2020-03-07T11:41:42+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;COULDDO vs TODO&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but I have TODO list anxiety. TODO lists feel like a giant pressure on me of endless and painful grind. I do not like TODO lists though.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;COULDDO lists though? Those are great.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1235991023383347200"&gt;asked on Twitter the other day about my coping strategies for depression&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm... So roughly it's:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Grind certain skills so that you can do them more or less on automatic. It's particularly important that you can do them without feeling emotionally engaged with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Use non-depressed periods to fill pipeline with ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example I can read reasonably well while depressed. I can write these daily notebook posts even on my off days because it's stuff I've thought about quite a lot and I've got an ideas list. I can cook decent food while depressed because I've got a good library of basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The daily notebook posts were getting to be a bit of a struggle until I implemented &lt;a href="https://github.com/DRMacIver/notebook/blob/master/ideas.md"&gt;ideas.md&lt;/a&gt;, a list of possible things I could write about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As I wrote earlier &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-09:44.html"&gt;you can't actually run out of ideas&lt;/a&gt;. I can keep that ideas.md file much fuller than my actual mental bandwidth and available time for writing posts, because putting entries in it is just idea generation and idea generation is easy.
Here I have to do the hard work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;ideas.md is an example of a COULDDO list: It's a list of things that I could do, but that I have no obligation to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;COULDDO lists are very good because they ensure that you avoid pipeline stalls, they help you maintain momentum:
When you're feeling listless and not really sure what to do and nothing sparks joy, or you find yourself staring into space, you can look at the list of things that you put together and see if there's anything in there that you currently feel up to doing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also use this for dealing with brain fog days: I have a day plan which I write out on paper of things that it would be useful to get done. It's OK if I get to the end of the day and haven't done all those things. It's even &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt;. The paper goes into the bin. The purpose is to ensure that when I find myself in that "Oh god what should I do?" state there is a ready procedure to hand to fill that gap, rather than a default of staring into space or checking Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stuff just happens and you probably don't know why</title>
    <updated>2020-03-07T12:02:47+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Stuff just happens and you probably don't know why&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I get ill a lot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why? Who knows. It's always happened to me. There are any number of theories. Maybe I have a weird immune system. Maybe I touch my face a lot. Maybe I'm a bit too stressed and not breathing properly as a result and that makes me notice mild illnesses more. Maybe it's a consequence of bad diet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is almost certain not monocausal and is because of a number of independent things that don't actually interact but each just up my chances of getting ill, because getting ill is a highly nondeterministic process that is an accumulation of many different things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, you know that big 20th century crime wave? Due to social breakdown, modernity, changing demographics, toxic masculinity responding to the different gender roles in an increasingly feminist world, the consequences of multiple wars, globalisation, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93crime_hypothesis"&gt;oops never mind it was probably just lead&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While we're on the subject of toxic masculinity, you know how every woman has experiences of being cat called in public by men?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No, that's not true actually. It's definitely the &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt; experience, but there are multiple women I know who have cautiously said to me "It's really weird. This just doesn't happen to me. Other women talk about how this is some ubiquitous thing and I've just never seen it". It's not an attractiveness thing - the women I've heard this from are mostly very attractive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that cat calling isn't a problem. It's a problem, of course, a major one. But somehow it's one that some women don't experience, and it's fairly mysterious as to why. It's easy to generate hypotheses, but it's hard to say which of them are accurate because it's &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; unlikely that it's monocausal, and if it is monocausal it's probably caused by something completely random like preferred colour palette or getting enough sleep or something.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Seemingly almost everyone in London is tired. Seemingly almost everyone in tech has a sleeping disorder. Why? Who knows. It's probably not monocausal, and if it is it's probably something random like the design of the tube network or homophily along shared social traits of people who sleep badly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Rival Voices has this idea of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nosilverv/status/1205082282979184640"&gt;secret handshake theory&lt;/a&gt; as implicit ways of groups signalling compatibility, and secret handshakes control what parts of the world you have access to, but I think this if anything &lt;em&gt;understates&lt;/em&gt; how weirdly specific our lived experiences are, and how many areas of life are opened to or locked away from us by seemingly inconsequential choices and behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We like the idea that the world makes sense and things happen to us for reasons, but this greatly underestimates its complexity, and the number of things that are indirect consequences of seemingly unrelated things that just change the numbers enough to completely shift our lived experience into a different pattern from other people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because we focus on this idea that the world makes sense, we tend to fit our experiences to simple narratives, and this causes us to assume they are much more shared than they are. We talk about the typical mind fallacy, but the typical lived experience fallacy is if anything more pervasive. Your lived experience is probably less universally shared than you think it is, and where it's shared it's probably not for the reasons you think it is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Questions like this are frustrating because they're in some sense purely empirical and &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be answerable by empirical and logical means, but you're probably never going to know the answer until the nature of the world shifts and the problem fixes itself and becomes obvious in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If a task is impossible, try making it harder</title>
    <updated>2020-03-07T12:18:55+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;If a task is impossible, try making it harder&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If a lecture is a struggle, try speeding up the video.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you struggle to read fast enough, try using a speed reader app that just scrolls the words by at 1000wpm.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If a book is too hard, try making it harder by reading it aloud. Maybe do weird balancing acts while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Often the rate limiting factor on difficult tasks is not actually that they're too hard, it's that we are failing to engage our full attention on them. This is particularly true if you're very smart and/or ADHD or somewhere vaguely in its vicinity. The world is literally moving too slowly for you, which means that you cannot bring your full attention to it, and as a result you never enter flow and the entire thing becomes a painful exercise which you can't help but fail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This creates the paradoxical solution that impossible seeming tasks are not too hard for you, they're too easy for you.
If you make them harder, you might find that they become possible, because they become something that can absorb your full attention. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is actually the true secret to success to a lot of productivity methodologies. They don't actually help, but by focusing on the methodology they become something that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html"&gt;you can nerd out about&lt;/a&gt; and because your nerding task is integrated with your grounding task, the two together can consume your full attention in a way that the mere task on its own could not. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Untangling moral concepts</title>
    <updated>2020-03-07T12:35:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Untangling moral concepts&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The following are not the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have an &lt;em&gt;obligation&lt;/em&gt; to do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;morally permissible&lt;/em&gt; to do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;morally virtuous&lt;/em&gt; to do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;morally required&lt;/em&gt; to do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Figuring this out is a process I call &lt;em&gt;untangling&lt;/em&gt;, which is essentially just a skill that you learn doing mathematics:
Finding a bunch of examples where the concepts separate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When untangling it's important that your examples pass the "c'mon, really?" test. They shouldn't be contrived or annoying, but should be points of separation that actually matter in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Obey the laws of physics". This is definitely 1 and 4, and definitely not 3, 5, or 6. There's no real moral component to physics, so there's no real moral significance to it. It's certainly permissible, because if you literally have no option but to do the thing it would be bizarre to consider it forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Obey the speed limit" is an example where 2 through 6 apply to varying degrees, but 1 does not. People clearly &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; break the speed limit and do so all the time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More, it's &lt;em&gt;common&lt;/em&gt; to have examples like this where people behave low grade unmorally for convenience.
Moral norms are more like guidelines than rules, and almost everyone implicitly understands this and treats them as such.
So, when considering moral norms, don't consider them as ironclad rules, consider them as things you're going to &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; follow. Depending on how serious they are, you'll probably want to follow them more often than not (the moral norms against killing people are stronger than the moral norms against spitting. You would probably still kill someone in some circumstances, even ones you didn't consider morally justified, but they'd have to be pretty extreme).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Brush your teeth" is something you should do which mostly lacks an moral component, so is (2) without any of the others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have made a promise to do something minor. Say, meet a friend for coffee. Suppose also that a major family crisis has occurred and they need you. "Meeting your friend for coffee" is an example of 3 on its own. You have an obligation (3) but you shouldn't do it, it's not permissible, it's not required, and it's not virtuous.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone is being a dick to you. You get angry at them. This is morally permitted, but it's not required or virtuous. Whether you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do it is situation dependent (it might be tactically wise to do so), but lets say it's not a good idea. So this is an example of (4) without any of the others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So none of (1) through (4) imply anything else on the list. Now we get into the tricky bits where I'm not entirely sure how cleanly they separate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Staying calm in a heated situation where someone is being a dick to you is an example of (5) that is not (6) - it is morally virtuous without being required. Giving all your money to charity is another example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Are there things which are morally virtuous but not morally permissible? I'm not sure. I can come up with some contrived examples where the answer is "Maybe?" (trolley problem type stuff). I think in practice this is probably not an interesting category and all the details will be too contextual.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Are there examples which are morally required but not morally virtuous? Another maybe. I'd say "not committing murder" is definitely ethically required, but it's not particularly praiseworthy. Unclear that it's virtuous, but it's certainly more virtuous than committing murder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My inclination is that for practical purposes we have (6) implies (5) implies (4), and the examples above show that these are the only implications possible.&lt;/p&gt;
