    <title>Making Success Trivial</title>
    <updated>2020-05-05T17:45:00+01:00</updated>

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Making Success Trivial&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-05&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When trying to acquire some habit or perform some practice, it's worth making your bar for success &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; low. Essentially, if there's any question of whether you're able to do it at a given time, that should be a sign that you're significantly compromised (ill, depressed, dealing with a crisis, etc).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The classic example of this is in meditation practice: Success is putting your ass on the meditation cushion and closing your eyes for a breath. Maybe you'll do a two hour sit after that, maybe not. You can feel good about it either way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other examples for me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a rereading practice. Every day I try to reread something from a book I have previously read. The only requirement is that it is a book that I have previously read and I read at least a page from it. I usually read more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have (as of yesterday, so we'll see how this one pans out) committed to spending 10 minutes per day tidying my bedroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general I expect to do a lot more than the bare minimum for the first most days, and I expect to be right on the edge of the bare minimum for the second (update: I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I actually wanted to do more today and did a full half an hour of cleaning). That's OK, both are success.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A daily writing practice can also be made trivial, but it requires a bit more setup work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is: The metric for success is that you have written something, in the place where you said you would write it. You probably shouldn't even set a minimum word count. You &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; shouldn't set a minimum quality count. All you need to do to succeed at writing is write.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is: If you can't make the task intrinsically easier, having a repertoire of strategies for achieving it can be very helpful. For things where the practice might require thought, it's useful to have tools for minimising that. For example, the approach of picking a random passage from a book, copying it out, and writing a few thoughts prompted by it, is one that guarantees that I can succeed at my writing practice if I feel like I don't have any thoughts to write about. The Tarot prompts work in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once you've made the practice trivial, a couple things can happen:
Everything can go great, you might discover that you don't want to do it, and you might discover that you want not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What you do if you don't want to do it depends a lot on the task. You might be getting paid to do it, or otherwise need to do it (I certainly don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to clean my room right now, but I want the clean room, so...). Or you might decide that actually this isn't worth doing unless you want to do it and abandon it. That's fine too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Wanting to not do it is different though. This is when you have a negative emotional reaction to the experience, possibly despite also wanting to do it. You're trying to do it and then &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html"&gt;the brakes come on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is generally a sign that you need to get debugging and figure out why you're having that reaction. In broad strokes there are two reasons why you have a negative emotional reactions to things: Something is actually wrong, or the situation looks like something that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;you've learned in the past&lt;/a&gt; is bad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In equally broad strokes, there are two solutions to negative emotional reactions: You can change the emotion, or you can change the situation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(There's probably an interesting 2x2 to draw here but I haven't got around to creating a good way to add those to notebook posts)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Changing the emotion can be hard but roughly involves &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html"&gt;figuring out where it comes from and bringing it in line with reality&lt;/a&gt; or acquiring a certain amount of discomfort tolerance. My recommendation is that for the goal of making success trivial you should not set out to do this. Instead, you should understand the nature of the emotional association, and try to find strategies that work around it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The one place where changing the emotional association &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important for triviality is to add self-compassion: Making sure you understand that &lt;em&gt;this strategy is OK&lt;/em&gt;. That it is better to have a recurring habit of trivial successes that you elaborate on as much or as little as you want than it is to have no habit at all, and to avoid punishing yourself for not meeting a higher standard. Getting comfortable with the method of trivial successes is important to avoid putting an ugh field around the whole subject.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In terms of changing the situation, two things seem to be important and and common here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-11-14:47.html"&gt;Removing trivial irritations&lt;/a&gt; - finding things which are easy to change and make the whole process much less irritating. e.g. listening to a podcast while cleaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;Creating safety&lt;/a&gt; - finding ways in which the process feels unsafe. For example, writing in private rather than public, or under a pseudonym, until you are comfortable with other people reading your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One non-obvious way that you might experience the process as unsafe is if it feels like an unbounded commitment. It's important to avoid the "Oh gods, I have to keep doing this &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;?" reaction, and keeping the level of commitment way down is helpful for doing that. In particular, you might be tempted to ratchet up the difficulty level - to say e.g. that once you're confident that you can read a page a day, you'll increase your minimum commitments, etc. I think it's probably a bad idea to do that, because you'll be aware that you're tricking yourself, and that you're creating a greater commitment for future you, and that might feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another emotion that can be difficult here is not wanting to start because you don't feel like you'll be allowed to stop. One way to deal with that is to give yourself explicit permission to stop. If it's awful, you don't have to keep doing it, you're just trying it on to see what it's like. If that doesn't work out, it's not a bad thing, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;you've learned something&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn't imply anything permanent or bad about you, you can always try again later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cleaning up the fnords in your environment</title>
    <updated>2020-05-06T11:30:15+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Cleaning up the fnords in your environment&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-06&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A "Fnord" is a concept from the rather strange "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2SG4PRi"&gt;Illuminatus! trilogy&lt;/a&gt;". They are explained thus:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That calmed me a little, so I set out the toast and coffee and fetched in the New York Times from the hallway. I turned the radio to WBAI and caught some good Vivaldi, sat down, grabbed a piece of toast and started skimming the first page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw the fnords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature story involved another of the endless squabbles between Russia and the U.S. in the UN General Assembly, and after each direct quote from the Russian delegate I read a quite distinct “Fnord!” The second lead was about a debate in Congress on getting the troops out of Costa Rica; every argument presented by Senator Bacon was followed by another “Fnord!” At the bottom of the page was a Times depth-type study of the growing pollution problem and the increasing use of gas masks among New Yorkers; the most distressing chemical facts were interpolated with more “Fnords.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I saw Hagbard’s eyes burning into me and heard his voice: “Your heart will remain calm. Your adrenalin gland will remain calm. Calm, all-over calm. You will not panic. You will look at the fnord and see it. You will not evade it or black it out. You will stay calm and face it.” And further back, way back: my first-grade teacher writing FNORD on the blackboard, while a wheel with a spiral design turned and turned on his desk, turned and turned, and his voice droned on,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF YOU DON’T SEE THE FNORD IT CAN’T EAT YOU, DON’T SEE THE FNORD, DON’T SEE THE FNORD …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked back at the paper and still saw the fnords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one step beyond Pavlov, I realized. The first conditioned reflex was to experience the panic reaction (the activation syndrome, it’s technically called) whenever encountering the word “fnord.” The second conditioned reflex was to black out what happened, including the word itself, and just to feel a general low-grade emergency without knowing why. And the third step, of course, was to attribute this anxiety to the news stories, which were bad enough in themselves anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A fnord is a thing that you have learned not to see, but that still triggers anxiety. It is not actually harmful in and of itself, except through the power of the emotional associations you have developed with it. The fnord can't actually eat you, but you are sufficiently terrified of it that you have learned to completely ignore its presence.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, not how operant conditioning works in reality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have learned not to see the fnords. What would happen if I put my finger on the page where the fnord is and told you there was a fnord there?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, you'd get annoyed at me. "Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; there's a fnord there." you'd say "Everyone knows there's a fnord there. Why are you drawing my attention to it?" and then you'd get annoyed with me for having the bad taste to talk about fnords.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of John Regehr's &lt;a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/861"&gt;Operant Conditioning by Software Bugs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used a new program or system and found it to be obnoxiously buggy, but then after a while you didn’t notice the bugs anymore? If so, then congratulations: you have been trained by the computer to avoid some of its problems. For example, I used to have a laptop that would lock up to the point where the battery needed to be removed when I scrolled down a web page for too long (I’m guessing the video driver’s logic for handling a full command queue was defective). Messing with the driver version did not solve the problem and I soon learned to take little breaks when scrolling down a long web page. To this day I occasionally feel a twinge of guilt or fear when rapidly scrolling a web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Negative responses from our environment &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;install learned beheaviours&lt;/a&gt; which cause us to avoid them. It's not that we &lt;em&gt;can't see&lt;/em&gt; the fnords, it's that we &lt;em&gt;don't look at them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The term "&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields"&gt;ugh field&lt;/a&gt;" apparently comes from Less Wrong (the friend I got it from is not a LW person but maybe she got it from someone who was):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem with the human mind — your human mind — is that it's a horrific kludge that will fail when you most need it not to. The Ugh Field failure mode is one of those really annoying failures. The idea is simple: if a person receives constant negative conditioning via unhappy thoughts whenever their mind goes into a certain zone of thought, they will begin to develop a psychological flinch mechanism around the thought. The "Unhappy Thing" — the source of negative thoughts — is typically some part of your model of the world that relates to bad things being likely to happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've always had an ugh field around cleaning, and around &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html"&gt;care work&lt;/a&gt; more generally. Reading "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2A4sFjg"&gt;Unfuck Your Habitat&lt;/a&gt;" recently has been quite helpful with coping with that, and I've added a daily 10 minute tidy of my room to &lt;a href="https://howtosurvivementalillness.tumblr.com/post/162396810334/how-to-make-and-use-a-coping-board"&gt;my coping board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-05-08:59.html"&gt;prediction yesterday&lt;/a&gt; was that I would stick to that ten minutes to the letter. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case. I completed a full &lt;a href="https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/whats-a-2010/"&gt;20/10&lt;/a&gt; of cleaning and then did another 10 minutes to finish it off and restore some order.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Specifically what I did was go through a giant miscellaneous pile of papers and mail, take everything out of its envelopes, and shred or otherwise recycle all of the bits that didn't need to be kept. I then return the pile to where it was in a slightly tidier and smaller form.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A friend asked whether being in a slightly tidier space felt different. My initial answer was that I hadn't really done enough to achieve that - the space looked pretty much as it was before, just with one corner of it slightly tidier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I later realised this wasn't true, there was one signficant difference: The pile of papers was no longer vaguely scary, because I knew what was in it and that it was all stuff that I either didn't need to deal with or was entirely able to deal with.
It wasn't &lt;em&gt;tidy&lt;/em&gt; yet, and so visually speaking the room looked much the same, but the &lt;a href="https://focusing.org/sixsteps"&gt;felt sense&lt;/a&gt; of the room had changed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The pile of papers was no longer a fnord.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't think this is all that's going on with me and cleaning, but I think it's a large part of it. A failure to care for the environment allows the fnords to breed, and once the environment is full of fnords, caring for it requires dealing with them, so the very idea of care acquires an ugh field.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2L1VcrS"&gt;Marie Kondo&lt;/a&gt;'s recommendation of learning to tell if an item sparks joy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; genuinely an important skill for cleaning, but if you're not going to buy in to the full blown minimalism cult, maybe an equally important emotional skill is learning to see the fnords.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Easy changes and Uncomfortable Reflections</title>
    <updated>2020-05-07T09:36:19+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Easy changes and Uncomfortable Reflections&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As I've talked about in my last two posts (&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-05-08:59.html"&gt;Making success trivial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-06-09:51.html"&gt;Cleaning up the fnords in your environment&lt;/a&gt;), my bedroom is a mess. I'd like it not to be a mess, and I've recently made two changes that are enabling that:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://howtosurvivementalillness.tumblr.com/post/162396810334/how-to-make-and-use-a-coping-board"&gt;a coping board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structuring longer cleaning around &lt;a href="https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/whats-a-2010/"&gt;20/10s&lt;/a&gt; (basically just pomodoros, but with some better ergonomics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My room is not currently clean, but it's a little cleaner than it was a week ago, and I think in a month it'll probably be pretty clean and I kinda expect to be able to keep it that way (I'll need to make some more structural changes than this in order to enable that, but these changes will get me to the point where the structural changes that I should make become more obvious).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You may notice something important about these two changes: They're really really easy, and I could have done them at any time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What this means, is that a long-running problem of mine, something that I've been feeling bad about for well over a decade (and had for longer), is something that I could have trivially fixed any time I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, should I feel guilty about not having done so? More, should I feel &lt;em&gt;ashamed&lt;/em&gt; about not having done so?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Distinction in case it's helpful: Guilt is "I did a bad thing", shame is "I am bad")&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I claim that the answer is no, and the answer is no for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The main one is that having negative emotional responses to success is maladaptive. It causes you to not want to succeed, and will tend to destroy the motivation to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;try things&lt;/a&gt;, and will cause you to feel bad while building the habit, which will tend to sabotage the habit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It might be right, in some circumstances, to feel a certain amount of guilt or shame over this, as long as they are proportionate (i.e. don't spiral out of control) and are more than counterbalanced by the positive feelings of success, but sucess does require confronting the honest truth that you are capable of succeeding, and that can be very unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you experience success as a negative, you will tend to discourage yourself from succeeding. This is relatively obvious when it's pointed out, but is a very easy trap to fall into. If you have this problem I'd recommend my previous &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/01/a-crash-course-in-having-feelings/"&gt;Crash Course in Having Feelings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I think it is &lt;em&gt;factually incorrect&lt;/em&gt; to feel guilt or shame about behaviour change, because it is the nature of change to be easy once it arrives: If you're having to force yourself through a gruelling process to change, you're probably just going to fail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead what happens is that you gradually build up skills and relationships, or your circumstances change, or one of a dozen other possibilities occur and suddenly change is easy. The thing that makes change easy now wouldn't necessarily have worked if you'd tried it five years ago, or ten, and even if it had worked you wouldn't have necessarily known how to find it among the thousands of other equally easy things that seemed equally plausible but wouldn't have worked for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Separating Impulse from Action</title>
    <updated>2020-05-08T13:04:37+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Separating Impulse from Action&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-08&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's a trick I figured out yesterday. It solves quite a specific problem that I have, but you might have similar problems, and even if not I think it demonstrates some useful general principles that could be applied in other circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is this: I buy too many books.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not a &lt;em&gt;disaster&lt;/em&gt; because I also read a lot of books, but I buy books at a higher rate than I read them, and I often buy books that I later decide that actually I'm not realistically going to read.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is basically that when I encounter an interesting book whose ideas I would like inside my brain, I often impulsively buy it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of this is a problem of impulse control, for sure, and I could definitely fix it by being better at impulse control, but currently I'm trying to be &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; good at impulse control, so that seems counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An additional complication is that the correct amount of books for me to be buying is not zero. I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; just blanket ban myself from buying books. I would experience it as unpleasant, but it's manageable, but that would not result in my buying the right number of books.
I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; read a lot of books (typically between one and three a week, not counting fiction which are a separate category because I read them as ebooks), and I like having new books around, and I can definitely afford to spend a certain amount of money on books.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The additional complicating factor is that my bookshelves serve as a kind of... thoughts I want to have later? They're a TODO list for reading, and my experience is that I will lose track of digital TODO lists for reading - they will get too large, and I will forget about them and leave them to rot (I am even worse at digital &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html"&gt;care work&lt;/a&gt; than physical).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, I:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a constant impulse to buy books, and suppressing it will be unpleasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do actually want to buy a non-zero amount of books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a way to keep track of the books I may want to buy later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there's an easy solution, and it's &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html"&gt;kinda stupid&lt;/a&gt; that it's taken me this long to realise it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The solution that satisfies all of these is to have:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a default Amazon list of books I wanted to buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a scheduled task every Sunday to buy a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now when I want to impulse buy a book I instead just click the add to list button instead of the buy now button. Then, every Sunday, I go through the list and decide which of these books is the one I want to buy the most right now. In the course of doing so, I remove any books from the list that I'm definitely sure I won't want to buy later.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This solution is actually very good, because it:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;puts the rate at which I buy things under my conscious control independently of the impulse to buy things (a thing I learned the value of from years with &lt;a href="http://beeminder.com/"&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gives a direct and (almost) equally satisfying replacement for the impulse activity by pressing a different and equally accessible button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fights the digital rot that lists normally have for me by coupling it to a regularly scheduled activity that I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do because I get rewarded with a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition I think it will significantly increase the quality of the books I do buy, because each book I buy will be a measured choice between alternatives where invest some effort in ensuring that my book this week will be a good one. I don't intend to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;avoid all error&lt;/a&gt; and I of course &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html"&gt;can't ensure I always pick the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; one&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm pretty sure that investing about twenty minutes of thought into the question will result in me improving on impulse decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Initial Notes Towards a Manifesto</title>
    <updated>2020-05-09T13:57:51+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Initial Notes Towards a Manifesto&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-09&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mechanical Monk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1258738843630678016"&gt;invited his mutuals to write a manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. This is my response to that, though given that this is a notebook it's a more modest attempt to gesture in the direction of what a manifesto would look like when I'm a bit more ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So what do I want? How do I want to change the world?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well I'd like to be able to claim some high minded ideal like universal love and cosmic oneness but that's not what I'm about. What I'm about is this: Dear humanity, we are &lt;em&gt;fucking this up&lt;/em&gt;, and it's annoying me and I'm embarrassed to be a part of it. I really shouldn't be the one to have to tell people how to sort their shit out because I'm terrible at this but apparently nobody else is going to do it right, so &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by this?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I mean that we are universally lacking in the basic systems, skills, and ethics, of being functioning, healthy, happy, human beings, and we need to fix that, and instead we are making it worse. We do not have a society that supports the development of those, and in many ways &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;we actively punish their acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An incomplete list of things we are bad at include thinking, feeling, moving, communicating, decision making, organisation, and helping each other out more broadly. Some of us are good enough at some of these things, but essentially nobody is at what I would like to consider the bare minimum standard for all of them (I sure as hell am not!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Currently I think we have roughly the following models for acquiring these skills:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dumb luck and/or privilege in having the right role models (unreliable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;School (monstrously bad at this, not really designed to do it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therapy and coaching (limited scope, expensive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weird borderline cults (tend to overfocus on an aspect of the problem and convince you it solves everything. Also, are cults)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-help books (similar problems to cults, also mostly very bad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these are grossly inadequate to the task.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I'm trying to push back on it. I cannot, at present, fix society and reshape it into a more pleasing image (though if you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; me to do that and can hand me the keys I uh have one or two ideas), but I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; provide people with tools that may help them under the current circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm acquiring the parts of these skills that I can figure out for myself, or with help, and I'm trying to be a model of how I think this should work. I'm helping other people around me take steps towards the same same, by writing about it, and by building relationships that support each other's growth.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this &lt;em&gt;isn't going to work&lt;/em&gt;. You cannot rely on me to teach you all the skills you need for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notebook is pretty good, and I hope to do better writing about this in future, but the really high value work is in personal relationships, and there's only one of me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My work is intrinsically built around my particular strengths and weaknesses - I'm a weird, queer, hyperverbal, nerd and so the problems I'm solving and the tools I'm using are designed with that in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am, as alluded to, &lt;em&gt;not very good at this&lt;/em&gt;, and I'm going to miss things, get things wrong, or communicate them in unhelpful ways, and we need many different voices doing the same sorts of things if we are to have any chance of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-28-06:45.html"&gt;climbing out of the crab bucket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(2) doesn't mean that you can't benefit from my writing if you're not like me, but it does mean that my tools are built in a very particular way for a very particular set of problems. They might or might not work for you (possibly with modification), but even if they work for you they might not solve all your problems because they're designed to solve &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; problems (and, to a lesser extent, the problems of people I know well enough to help). You need to build your own tools too! And then, once you have, I want you to share them with other people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I want you to share them with other people while &lt;em&gt;understanding that their tools might not work for others&lt;/em&gt;.
When I wrote &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-08-10:06.html"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; I very clearly spelled out why this was a good solution for me, and that these might not be the same for you. All tools will be like this, but right now people tend to get very evangelical about how their tool is the one size fits all to all problems, and this is extremely wrong, both factually and morally.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm losing steam on writing more of this right now, so I'm going to just end with a list of things I want people to do:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut people some slack. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-06-15:20.html"&gt;Create&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; for those around you. Sign non-aggression pacts in the goddamn &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-06-04-09:58.html"&gt;legibility war&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat the problems in your life as interesting and worth solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join and learn from &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html"&gt;nerd&lt;/a&gt; communities who can help you solve them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html"&gt;growth relationships&lt;/a&gt;, where everyone involved helps everyone else be better versions of themselves. I'm particularly a fan of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html"&gt;the support group model&lt;/a&gt;, but this is one of those tools that might not work for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/"&gt;Explain&lt;/a&gt; these things to others. Obviously I'm a fan of the notebook blog format, but again that might not be what works for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I understand that what I am asking of you is difficult, and I understand that for some of you it may not yet be possible, but I'm trying my best to make it possible, and easy, for as many people as I can, and I hope that some of you will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to be a better person</title>
    <updated>2020-05-10T12:24:24+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;How to be a better person&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-10&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In response to my &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html"&gt;Initial notes towards a manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joxn"&gt;@joXn&lt;/a&gt; quite reasonably asked how I would avoid falling afoul of the problem that, contra The Good Place, learning ethics doesn't actually make one more ethical. Eric Schwitzgebel has a lot of great research on this (see &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/"&gt;his publications&lt;/a&gt; and in particular the section "The Relationship Between Moral Reflection and Moral Behavior").&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of these, I think &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm"&gt;Aiming for Moral Mediocrity&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most important:
Schwitzgebel argues that most people probably aim to be about as moral as their peers, and that this is mediocre (neither great, nor terrible) to do, but that most people could manage to be better than they are with no great hardship.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think Schwitzgebel's claim is basically right, and the paper is a very good one, with two major caveats:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is underestimating the hardship, because (I think) he is missing one of the reasons why this happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He has fallen afoul of precisely the reason why learning ethics does not make you a better person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there are approximately four reasons why people fail to behave ethically:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do not care to do the right thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are discouraged from doing the right thing by external factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do not know what the right thing is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do not know how to do the right thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Behaving ethically is a skillful practice, and most people are either not very good at the skill, not very motivated to practice it, or do not have an environment that enables them to practice it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ethicists primarily study what the right thing to do is, but I think for most people this is not the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html"&gt;constraint&lt;/a&gt; on the skillful practice of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I will, for the purpose of this post, assume that people &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; to do the right thing. I think fixing that is a whole different question. This leaves the other three. Given that we know from Schwitzgebel's work that knowing the right thing to do is also not enough, lets assume for the moment that you, in most practical circumstances if not necessarily in general, know what the right thing to do is. Why don't you do it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, lets take a look at Schwitzgebel's theme of Moral Mediocrity: Why do people aim to be morally mediocre?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I propose that there's a very straightforward reason: Moral Mediocrity is the option that won't get you punished.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you behave badly, people will be judgemental towards you. But they will also react badly to you if you are especially moral. It's not just that you're not a saint it's that, in actual practice, we don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; saints, because they make us feel bad about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the examples in the paper is vegetarianism. Suppose you were reasonably convinced that, ethically speaking, you should be a vegetarian or vegan. Now, all your interactions with people around you around food come with extra friction. Even if you never say anything judgy about it, it's impossible for people to not know you're vegetarian (if they're sharing meals with you) and many of them will respond defensively or aggressively about it. You'll experience a constant, albeit low grade, pressure of the people around you trying to drag you back down to their moral level.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You'll see this with other things too: Someone who is unusually ethical will constantly have people telling them to relax, take things less seriously, etc. Being unusually ethical is weird, and triggers the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;social obligation to be bad at things&lt;/a&gt; in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is not, I hasten to add, a moral justification for being morally mediocre. It doesn't change what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do. If anything, the tendency of people to norm their behaviour to those around them creates a stronger moral obligation to be good, because it influences others to be good. It is a &lt;em&gt;practical barrier to ethical behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, and any theory of ethics that does not teach you to overcome such practical barriers will not result in more ethical behaviour any more than a detailed understanding of thermodynamics will allow you to build an internal combustion engine. A theory of ethics is all very well, but you need a &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; of ethics, which is what Schwitzgebel's paper (along with most theory of ethics) misses: Telling people to behave a particular way tends not to work unless you tell them &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to behave that way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's another practical barrier: If you realise that you are behaving badly, and decide to be better, you have to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html"&gt;reconcile yourself to the fact that you could always have been better&lt;/a&gt;, which is very painful, so you would much rather rationalise your behaviour as just fine the way it is to avoid that pain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And for another, consider the following scenario: Suppose you decide to be vegetarian, and you're really good about it for about a month, virtuously resisting the temptation to eat meat, and absolutely hating how bland all your food has become because you don't know how to cook interesting vegetarian food and the cafeteria where you mostly eat has awful vegetarian food. After about a month, you go out for a meal with some friends, and you look at the incredibly disappointing vegetarian menu and your eyes are drawn to the cheesburger selection... and after that you're no longer vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This actually demonstrates &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; problems: Firstly, you don't know how to be vegetarian, and are trying to overcome that limitation with pure willpower rather than treating it as a practical problem you need to solve, and the second is that you don't understand behaviour change so you tried to go all in on the new behaviour and then gave up as soon as you failed once.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are the three main practical barriers to overcome: Social norms, emotional difficulties, and missing skills, and all of these are emimently solvable problems that you can learn to overcome, and that you will find personally beneficial to learn to overcome regardless of whether you use them to become more ethical.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More, I think once you have acquired these skills, you will naturally become more ethical (or at least, more in line with your own values): If you can change when you feel like you should, and you feel like you should behave a particular way, then you'll just do that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So this is my answer to how I'm intending to avoid this problem: I don't plan to try to persuade anyone of the rightness of a particular position, I'm just doing my best to convey some fragments of useful prosocial skills, and trusting that as you get better at those skills you'll become a better person automatically.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mostly, at least. You'll probably still be bad occasionally. That's OK. It's more fun to be a bit evil from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building and Rebuilding Foundational Skills</title>
    <updated>2020-05-11T12:01:22+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Building and Rebuilding Foundational Skills&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-11&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a problem: I'm kinda OK at statistics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why is this a problem? Being kinda OK seems... kinda OK, right?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, it would be, but the problem isn't that I have an intermediate level of statistical skill. The problem is that I have a broad range of statistical skill, all of which I'm kinda OK at. I'm kinda OK at elementary statistics, and I'm kinda OK at advanced statistics too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a real problem for learning more, because it is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; to relearn basics because they feel too basic for my skill level.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have another problem: Climbing is a fun sport that makes a good social activity and works on a number of strength skills that I would like to work on. Also I give myself a back injury 100% of the time I do it, because my ability to climb is much greater than my skill at climbing, because I'm hypermobile and have a decent strength to body weight ratio, and the result is that despite some things feeling easy, I do them badly and this results in me inadvertently harming myself while doing them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these share a common theme: It is possible for something to be easy while still being bad at it, and this is especially true with foundational skills, where you've built capabilities on top of them, and going back and relearning the basics is hard and boring.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to get good at statistics, I'd need to grind a bunch of exercises that I frankly feel are beneath me.
I'm probably going to try (despite my &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-03-09:09.html"&gt;complicated feelings about mathematics&lt;/a&gt;) because being good at statistics is important for me professionally and spiritually, and I'll never get good at it until I sort out the basics, and also being bad at those basics risks me tripping up in stupid ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to get good at climbing, I'd need to very carefully (and probably with supervision) try far easier routes than I can manage, and stop far sooner than it seems like I can. I'd have to deliberately hold myself back until I was much better at the basics than I am, despite my ability to do more. I don't value climbing enough at present to do this, so I probably will just avoid climbing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is is why I'm currently restarting the first week of Couch to 5K despite having completed it relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's another problem: I obviously breathe badly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm not fully sold on the Buteyko method, which encourages you to breathe less and entirely through your nose, but I obviously mouth breathe at night based on my sleep quality and dry mouth in the morning, and my peak flow numbers aren't great. I'd like to work on this to the point where I breathe through my nose unconsciously and easily, even while sleeping. It probably won't change my life in the way that the Buteyko method promises (though it sure would be nice if it did!), but at the very least it might improve my sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Breathing is definitely a foundational skill, and it's one I'm bad at, so I'd like to work on it, and working on breathing is &lt;em&gt;deathly&lt;/em&gt; boring.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is where I link in three previous tools:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can nose breathe just fine while at rest. I can complete couch to 5k week one (consistent of eight repetitions of a 60 second run followed by a 90 second walk) just fine. What I absolutely cannot do is complete Couch to 5K week one while nasal breathing. I can just about manage the first run and then I am &lt;em&gt;wrecked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is the way to rebuild foundations, and one of the core reasons why &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html"&gt;learning a different skill&lt;/a&gt; is often essential for progressing at your current goal: By transferring to a different context where the foundational skill is no longer easy, it becomes a thing that you can now actively work at. Working on a foundation in its existing context is often too easy to be possible, so &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:12.html"&gt;the way to work on it is to make it harder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was in fact, already considering restarting week one of Couch to 5K, for two other reasons, both of which are also about foundational skills.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As well as breathing, I'm also bad at walking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm aware that these are both ridiculous things to be bad at. I think a lot of you reading this are probably bad at them too though. As I said, we have &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html"&gt;a widespread lack of the basic skills of being a human being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I have quite flat feet and weak arches, and a bunch of (probably) related joint pain. I've tried wearing arch support shoes and my considered opinion is that it was an expensive waste of time. (Well, it was a good &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A slightly less fringe (but still fringe) opinion is that the solution to this is actually to have &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; arch support, and to wear barefoot shoes that are designed to protect your feet without supporting them,
because this causes you to actually develop your muscles rather than weaken them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This seems worth a shot, and I was noticing that my ankles were already starting to hurt a bit as a result of week one. I don't want to end up in the situation like with climbing where my ability to do a run exceeds my ability to do a run without injuring myself, so this too seems like a thing I could reasonably make harder in order to work on the foundational skills of.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even without these foundations of breathing and walking, I was still thinking it might be worth repeating Couch to 5K, because I disagree with some of its philosophical premises.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Couch to 5K is designed to ramp up the difficulty level by making you run more, and more consistently. I personally think it ramps up the difficulty too quickly. I basically agree with Sarah Perry's point in &lt;a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/03/body-pleasure/"&gt;Body Pleasure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] people enjoy exercise up to a certain level of intensity, which varies for each person. Most people who do low-intensity exercise feel better during the mild exertion. At the point when the body can no longer maintain levels of oxygen and (separately) lactate in the muscles, the exercise becomes so intense that basic affect (feeling good or feeling bad, the lowest-level evaluation of anything) plummets. Everybody feels terrible when they exercise too hard. Once people rest for a few minutes, they start feeling good again. However, this may not be enough such that people evaluate the entire experience as pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most on-ramps to exercise are at an intensity too high for previously-sedentary people to find them pleasurable. If people go to a fitness class, or focus on running a particular distance at a particular speed, they’ll likely miss the pleasure zone entirely. Refocusing on exercising only for one’s own individual pleasure, as slowly as one prefers, and only at intensities that are pleasurable, is more likely to motivate repeat and habitual exercising. At that point, the enjoyment of exercise pleasure can build on itself, motivating longer and longer intervals of experiencing the pleasure. I summarize Ekkekakis et al.’s result as: “learn to exercise out of extreme selfish laziness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was a little skeptical about doing Couch to 5K because one of the things I'm trying to work on at the moment is to enjoy exercise, and honestly I don't enjoy running. I'd already been vaguely considering restarting week one so that I could get to the point where it was pleasurable rather than merely endurable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I liked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1258846038552489984"&gt;David Laing's point the other day&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice on how to get better at a given thing should often be replaced with advice on how to take more pleasure in doing that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasure doesn't lead directly to learning, but it leads to &lt;em&gt;volume&lt;/em&gt;, which leads to learning. Also pleasure is an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know exactly how to create pleasure in a thing, but I suspect fluidity is a huge part of it. There is something intrinsically pleasurable about being good enough at something hard that you can do it automatically and reliably, and I think fluidity is extremely helpful for being able to play with a skill.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I suspect this points to a general reason why we are so often bad at foundations: We treat the point at which we should progress as to when we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do the thing, when in fact we should be progressing when it's &lt;em&gt;pleasurable&lt;/em&gt; to do it (or at least fluid where pleasure is impossible). This ties in to the idea that you are not good at doing a thing until you are able to do it reliably rather than able to do it at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you progress as soon as you clear some minimum bar of being &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to do it, then what happens is that the skill will get progressively more and more frustrating as you move up it until you hit some "natural" limit where your frustration exceeds your willingness to progress, and you can no longer easily go back and work on the foundations, so you conclude that you're now as good as you're goign to get.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For reasons, I was reading about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem"&gt;Bloom's 2 sigma problem&lt;/a&gt; recently, which is often used as evidence for the superiority of private tutoring over general classes, but I found the description of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning"&gt;mastery learning&lt;/a&gt;, which is the specific system being compared, especially interesting:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In comparison, I think most of our school based learning techniques are like Couch to 5K: They assume that there is some straightforward time frame on which you can expect people to progress, and you should progress as long as you can just about manage the previous level, and failure to progress is a sign of significant failure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How much of the 2 sigma system is about the benefits of individual instruction, and how much of it is just about giving people the time to build their foundations before progressing?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This all fits in well to the framework of the &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/"&gt;Fully General System for Learning to Do Hard Things&lt;/a&gt;, but I think I have previously neglected something important: It's not at all obvious what &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; mean in this context. I suspect the threshold for progression should be set much higher than I previously would have set it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Couch to 5K fits pretty well into the Fully General System, in that it repeatedly takes something that you can do (Week N) and makes it slightly harder (Week N + 1), eventually culminating in being able to do a half hour run. It seems pretty good, for a lot of people, in that it gets them to do something that would previously have seemed unattainable, but I'm no longer convinced that either it or the Fully General System are good enough for that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this notion of foundational skills, and the question of mastery progression, point to a common flaw in Couch to 5K and the Fully General System: They are overly narrowly focused on the goal, and don't care about what possible future progress they burn along the way to getting there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I'm still going to try to do hard things, and I'm still going to complete Couch to 5K, but in doing so my aims are not merely to do a half hour run but to do a half hour run while breathing entirely through my nose, wearing barefoot shoes, and enjoying it, and all the while paying attention to the process and using it to learn more about progression and skill development in general.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why are things hard?</title>
    <updated>2020-05-12T12:21:57+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Why are things hard?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-12&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've recently started a &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/coming-soon"&gt;Substack Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; called "How to do hard things", based on &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/"&gt;my unexpectedly popular post of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There will be a lot of overlap between the newsletter and this notebook. I'm not quite sure how I'm going to use it yet, but I'm expecting there will be a bit of a back and forth, with the newsletter being a place I use to collect and develop themes I've written about here, which will in turn spark more notebook posts here. If you're enjoying the notebook, I'd also recommend subscribing to the substack. For now at least, you don't need to sign up for a paid tier - the content is the same for all subscribers, but with the discussion / community features turned on for paid ones.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this has got me thinking about The Fully General System For Learning To Do Hard Things. I still think it's a good framework, but I think it's missing a lot of important features - some of which only require additions to it, some of which might require some modifications.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the principle problems with it is, I think, the fact that what it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; is extremely under defined. What is a "hard thing"? And how does one learn to do it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The principle assumption in the post is that things are hard because you lack the skill to do them effortlessly. It's true, some things are like that. But that's a relatively tiny fraction of the ways in which things can be hard, and most things that are hard in one way are hard in multiple, not necessarily easily distinguishable, ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Fully General System as previously described really only admits three possible reasons why things might be hard:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might not know how to do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might know how to do them but not be able to execute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might not know exactly what it is you're trying to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there are quite a few other ways in which things can be hard.
Here is a partial list:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack some simple trick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; about what it is you're trying to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack resources that you need to do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack motivation to do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might find the whole subject of doing them aversive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There might be some &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-11-14:47.html"&gt;trivial irritation&lt;/a&gt; preventing you from doing the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack a foundational skill that they need but that isn't obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be doing something foundational very badly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack awareness of or access to the expertise you need to learn how to do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might need someone to help you do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be rusty at the relevant skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone else might be trying to stop you doing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thing you are trying to do might have unacceptable consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There might be social norms making it hard to do the thing in the easy way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might not be worth doing the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thing might be intrinsically hard in ways that require you to just do a lot of wor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thing might be intrinsically uncertain, making reliable success impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thing might be risky (and thus unsafe to experiment with while learning).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Additionally there are a whole bunch of general reasons why doing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; might be hard for you:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might not have enough time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have a distracting environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might not be getting enough sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be depressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have other mental health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have physical health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack more general skills around learning and habit formation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack more general skills around debugging why things are hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, most hard things are some mix of multiple of these things, and usually not a small number of them, and any truly general system for learning to do hard things must take this into account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to read a book</title>
    <updated>2020-05-13T10:54:07+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;How to read a book&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-13&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feelings about Adler and Van Doren's classic &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2LqWf50"&gt;How to read a book&lt;/a&gt;. There's a lot I like about it, and my reading definitely improved after I read it, but I also disagree with a lot of it. I have not engaged with the book in a way that they think entitles me to disagree with it, but that's OK because I also disagree with their claims around when you are entitled to disagree with a book.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But that's not what this post is about. This post is about what one might think of the central failing of the book: Despite the title, it never actually tells you how to read a book.
It is not a book about how to read a book at all, it is a book about how to engage with the contents of a book.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is not what reading is.
Reading is not an act conducted by a pure mind engaging with an idealised platonic flow of information.
Reading is an active engagement between a physical body and a physical object. The &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; of reading is to engage with the content, but reading itself is a physical act.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And the physical act matters, clearly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is obvious in the extreme cases. If you are in constant pain while reading you're not going to be able to concentrate on the reading, right? But I think it matters far more than we expect it to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People often are amused at how strong my opinions on book formats are, but this is because book formats are important.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Briefly my opinions on book formats are:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audiobooks might be fine but I haven't been able to make them work for me (I should revisit this now that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-11-14:47.html"&gt;I have solved my problems with podcasts&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ebooks are a shit format for consuming hard material, but their convenience often outweighs their shittiness for lighter material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most hardbacks are a bad format made by bad people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trade paperbacks and other large paperback formats are a blight on humanity and the people responsible for them should be put on trial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small, light, ideally paperback, books are the god tier format and are the only one that allows you to properly engage with difficult material.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You will tell me about textbooks etc that have too much content to be small and thus are better as large physical books or PDFs. I acknowledge those textbooks cannot be made smaller, but I contend that this is because they shouldn't have been written with that much content in the first place and should have been a series of shorter books. This is a separate argument.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason why ebooks are bad is twofold:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The physicality of engaging with a book is actually very helpful for organising knowledge (you've got an intuitive sense of where things were in the book, and also physical libraries are a much better exobrain that digital ones).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They add significant latency and inconvenience to many of the actions you take in the course of reading (paging, especially backwards, flicking through the book at random, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason large physical books are bad is that it is almost impossible to maintain &lt;a href="https://learnmuscles.com/blog/2017/10/18/reading-writing-and-posture/"&gt;a proper reading posture while reading them&lt;/a&gt; without a book stand or something, which let's be honest literally nobody is using. They also can't be carried in your bag (and a book stand certainly can't), which means your opportunities to read them will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why am I telling you all of this?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm telling you all of this because if the physicality of reading matters, and you are struggling to read, then you may be able to improve your reading not by "improving your reading skills" in some sense, or by fixing whatever is stopping you from concentrating, but by simply changing actual practical physical details about your reading habits. It's possible that you're just fine at reading but are attempting to read in a way that doesn't work well for you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here are some interventions in the act of reading that have all worked pretty well for me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading out loud. Reading out loud makes it &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier to engage with difficult material. It causes you to remember it better, and the act of reading out loud &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:12.html"&gt;makes it harder in a way that makes it possible to concentrate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explicitly structuring your reading into a 20/10 pattern (20 minutes reading, 10 minutes mandatory break) so as to manage fatigue and concentration better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix your reading posture so that you hold the book out in front of you rather than looking down at it. The looking down posture is not good for your neck and breathing in a way that I think disrupts the ability to concentrate and makes you feel more distracted while reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading while standing up (with the book held in front of you!) and vaguely walking or pacing is particularly good. This combines particularly well with reading out loud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading while &lt;a href="https://alexandertechnique.co.uk/learning-it/semi-supine"&gt;Semi-Supine&lt;/a&gt; with the book held out in front of you. This combines particularly well with the 20/10 structure, with your phone deliberately left out of reach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these seem kinda dumb and like they shouldn't matter, because we have become overly attached to the idea of books as pure sources of information that we engage with intellectually, rather than physical objects that we interact with physically as part of a process with an intellectual goal, and little things often have a much larger effect on such processes than we think they do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They're all also very easy, so if you really think they won't work, the fastest way to prove me wrong is to just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;try them and see what happens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joy in Sadness</title>
    <updated>2020-05-14T07:22:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Joy in Sadness&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-14&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2T377tI"&gt;A Field Guide to Getting Lost&lt;/a&gt;, pages 118-119:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a voluptuous pleasure in all that sadness, and I wonder where it comes from, because as we usually construe the world, sadness and pleasure should be far apart. Is it that the joy that comes from other people always risks sadness, because even when love doesn't fail, mortality enters in; is it that there is a place where sadness and joy are not distinct, where all emotion lies together, a sort of ocean into which the tributary streams of distinct emotions go, a faraway deep inside; is it that such sadness is only the side effect of art that describes the depths of our lives, and to see that described in all its potential for loneliness and pain is beautiful? There are songs of insurgent power; they are essentially what rock and roll, an outgrowth of one strain of the blues, does best, these songs of being young and at the beginning of the world, full of a sense of your own potential. Country, at least the old stuff, has mostly been devoted instead to aftermath, to the hard work it takes to keep going or the awareness that comes after it is no longer possible to go on. If it is deeper than rock it is because failure is deeper than success. Failure is what we learn from, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I find that I am reluctant to write about this passage, partly because I do not fully understand it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is there pleasure in sadness? Well, there can be of course. That which grounds you in your body is often easy to experience as pleasurable, at least until it becomes too intense, or you become bored of it, and you dissociate in order to numb yourself away from it. Feelings are experienced bodily, so can be a source of pleasure, even when those feelings are sadness - they connect you up with yourself, and you can revel in that connection.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But joy? I don't know. Sadness and joy &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; seem opposed to me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the problem is that I don't really know what joy is.
I've been trying to figure out how to expand my positive emotional range, and this lack of understanding of joy is part of that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3bqscos"&gt;The Book of Human Emotions&lt;/a&gt;, Tiffany Watt Smith cites Spinoza:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing the stories of our lives were fundamentally beyond our control, Spinoza linked joyfulness to the accidental and unforeseen. It surges up when something is better than we can possibly have imagined. "Joy is pleasure accompanied by the idea of something past, which has had an issue &lt;em&gt;beyond our hope&lt;/em&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So perhaps there &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a joy in sadness. We are bad at self-reflection, and an upswelling of sadness (if we do not ignore it) grounds us, shows us an aspect of who we are that we didn't know was there. Accompanied with the pleasure of being grounded in ourself, it's like the sudden appearance of an old friend. A joyous greeting ensues: "Hello, what are you doing here? I didn't expect to see you here at at all."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But certainly not all sadness prompts joy, as I think we are collectively discovering in the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/avyfain/status/1260832192030097409"&gt;Avy observed the following earlier today&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness is all about being fully present, and not letting your mind slip into thinking about past or future. It feels good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, months of isolation have been all about the right now. Living in an infinite present is awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how to reconcile this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this reading of joy has something to add here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness can definitely be experienced as pleasure - I do, and honestly it's usually a bit too much for me to handle for more than short periods of time - but fundamentally undifferentiated pleasure is &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can see this when you use attention to turn off pain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The next time you're experiencing pain, focus your attention on it. You can often turn it off, or reframe it as interesting and enjoyable (whether this works is somewhat variable. For example I can't do this with headaches). But how long will you last doing it? If you're like me, lasting more than scant minutes is impossible - at some point the pain becomes preferable to the boredom.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a lack of skill, and once one is at the point where one can sustain a two hour seated meditation, the boredom is entirely manageable, or perhaps even the boredom can be experienced as pleasurable. I don't know. Meditation is not among my skills.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I suspect most people lack the skill to reframe boredom as pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If joy is pleasure in the unexpected, then it is no surprise that mindfulness can bring joy in a way that the eternal now of pandemic time cannot, because mindfulness comes with a suspension of judgement that we, for the most part, cannot manage all the time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://meaningness.com/wonder"&gt;David Chapman recently wrote about wonder&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suggest that wonder occurs in heightened agendaless attention combined with suspension of habitual interpretation. Heightened agendaless attention allows and perceives unexpected patterning; suspension of habitual interpretation allows and perceives unexpected nebulosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://meaningness.com/nebulosity"&gt;nebulosity&lt;/a&gt; is a term he uses in a technical sense idiosyncratic to his meaningness project. Nebulosity is the property of things that seem well defined to become vague at their boundaries)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I propose that this suspension of habitual interpretation is also one of the key differences between mindfulness and pandemic time. We experience joy because we are able to put aside, for a moment, our interpretation and thus our understanding, so whatever comes next will be equally surprising.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the pandemic we are not able to do that, partly because we are not able to maintain this suspension for long periods of time anyway, and partly because it is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; to suspend interpretation when we are under threat.
Interpretation is a key part of our threat assessment and merely &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html"&gt;knowing&lt;/a&gt; that doesn't help us feel safe enough to do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And without this suspension of interpretation, without the perpetual surprise that comes with it, an eternal now is not a joyous experience. We experience only the sadness, without the ability to joyously revel in it, because we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what is there, and we are bored of it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And without that joy, the eternal now takes a darker turn, because although an eternal now is experienced in mindfulness, it is also a symptom of depression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html"&gt;written before&lt;/a&gt; about Matthew Ratcliffe's book, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3fJk71w"&gt;Experiences of Depression&lt;/a&gt;, and his notion of &lt;em&gt;existential feelings&lt;/em&gt; - feelings which lack an aboutness, but are instead part of the background structure of our experience of reality. Feelings associated with the passage of time are a significant type of existential feeling.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ratcliffe proposes that much of the depressive experience can be thought of as disruption to existential feelings. Given that, it's not surprising that we can experience the disruption to the passage of time as depression. Also, for those of us already prone to depression, I suspect that some disruption to existential feelings can prompt a broader depressive episode, through trained associations and kicking off feedback loops that drive us deeper into this depression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What defines the difference between whether a disruption to the passage of time causes depression or joy?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I suspect part of it is &lt;em&gt;agency&lt;/em&gt;. In mindfulness, we are in a situation which we can choose to end whenever we need to. We have voluntarily entered into that state. It's a weird, inverted, image of the difference between a rollercoaster and a genuine threat: Because we are there voluntarily, the experience of the fear is qualitatively different even when the level of fear may be the same. Because we have chosen to suspend our experience of time, we can maintain an open curiousity, and can experience that disruption as joyous.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What does all this mean?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, it suggests at least three routes for dealing with the eternal now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is that we can end it. We can take steps to texture time for ourselves. I've been working on this a bit recently and so far my experience is that it's good but also doesn't work. Previously I was living day to day, now I'm living week to week. The world is textured but still small.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is that we can cultivate agency without the eternal now. We may not be able to deal with it, but we can start projects, we can control that which we have access to. I think many people are taking this route.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third, which is hardest and I barely know where to start, but ultimately may be the only option that works, is that we can try to learn to take joy in it. We can practice curiousity, reconcile ourselves to the endlessness in all of it, and try to explore the details of the world that is available to us. Maybe we'll be surprised by what we find there.&lt;/p&gt;
