&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Teleology is fake&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-02&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tobi has written about &lt;a href="https://ramble.rixx.de/2020/03/30/on-origin-stories.html"&gt;origin stories&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of asking "What is this for?" instead of "Where does this come from?". He doesn't use the word teleology (the study of the purpose of things) but in the Adlerian psychology the post is based on that is what he's talking about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've previously talked about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;the usefulness of teleology in understanding our emotional reactions&lt;/a&gt; and how understanding the purpose of an emotional reaction (its teleology) is important to adjusting it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both Tobi and my posts have the same aetiology (origin story), which is that we read The Courage to be Disliked (a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html"&gt;useful yet punchable book&lt;/a&gt;), which is in large part about using an understanding of teleology to change your social behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do not want to minimize the importance of this approach, which is very powerful and important, but it does have a critical problem with it: Teleology is fake. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html"&gt;Things don't happen for reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Questions to ponder:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is this fence here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do giraffes have long necks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why am I taking singing classes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The answer to all of these questions is: There isn't a good reason, but they're still important. Teleology is fake.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence"&gt;Chesterton's fence&lt;/a&gt; is the idea that if there is a fence in a field, you should not take it down unless you know the reason why it is there:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But "Why is this fence here?" is a slippery question. Do we mean it as a question of aetiology or teleology? "What is the use of this fence?" is a very different question from "Who put this fence here and why?". You might answer the latter, find out that it is for reasons that no longer apply, and tear the fence down, and discover that the local ecology collapses because now grazing sheep can get somewhere they previously couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a quote that is &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7659686-tradition-is-a-set-of-solutions-for-which-we-have"&gt;apparently from a sci-fi novel I've never read&lt;/a&gt;, by Donald Kingsbury:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems. Throw away the solution and you get the problem back. Sometimes the problem has mutated or disappeared. Often it is still there as strong as it ever was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, like Chesterton's fence, is an extremely conservative principle against reform that is also wildly optimistic about how easy reform is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is that tradition is not just a solution to problems we've forgotten, it's also a foundational layer on which we have built subsequent things. In the fence example, maybe the sheep came long after the fence, and were just never a problem before now. Changing the tradition invalidates foundational assumptions for many other things you were doing, possibly without even knowing they were there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now lets talk about giraffes. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-31-09:52.html"&gt;Animals are a good model for social behaviour after all&lt;/a&gt;.
Why do giraffes have long necks?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well there are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe#Neck"&gt;a couple possible reasons&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to high up leaves which lets them outcompete other grazers by having more food supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexual selection (male giraffes fight by beating each other using their necks. It's terrifying).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to see predators from further away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these seem to be good hypotheses. Which one is the true reason?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well... probably all of them. Evolution doesn't actually do things for reasons. Evolution just tries random nonsense, and sometimes the random nonsense proves useful in ways that gives a net advantage. If something is useful for multiple weak reasons, that's just as good as it being useful for a single strong reason (potentially even better! More robust, more directions to develop in). So the "reason" giraffes have long necks might just be "All of the above, plus some things we didn't think of, plus these add up to being worth the cost".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Evolution doesn't design things how a human designer sits down and design things (although in practice things created by humans are also designed in an evolutionary way, but the "mutation" process is a bit more directed) - it doesn't need simple legible reasons for what it does, it just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;tries stuff&lt;/a&gt; and sees how it pans out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Even this is of course too much of an anthropomorphisation of evolution, but it's a useful one)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Moving away from complex messy evolved systems that make no sense to instead discussing the human mind and its decision making, which obviously makes complete sense, I'm going to be taking singing lessons once the pandemic has lifted and I can find a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why? Well...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not very good at breathing and want to get better at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm slightly embarrassed about how bad I am at singing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do a lot of public speaking and I'd like to be better at projecting as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better voice control seems an interesting skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a great embodiment practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ties in well with Alexander Technique, which I'm learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be a good self-confidence boost to be able to be good at singing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those are the big ones, but there are more. But no single one of these is remotely close to enough to convince me to learn to sing. Any two or three wouldn't be. What's convinced me to learn to sing is that an accumulation of enough good, individually insufficient, reasons, has tipped it over to the point where the cost-benefit analysis is a clear net win.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is how everything works. Teleology is a useful lens to look at problems through, and should not be discarded, but ultimately if we think things are happening for a simple, clear, and comprehensible purpose, and that if we change them then nothing will change except insofar as it is related to that purpose, we're going to be in for an unpleasant surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anxiety vs Worry</title>
    <updated>2020-04-03T17:46:23+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Anxiety vs Worry&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-03&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is a distinction I've found useful recently: You are &lt;em&gt;anxious&lt;/em&gt; about something if the emotion attaches to the uncertainty in the situation, you are &lt;em&gt;worried&lt;/em&gt; about something if the emotion attaches to the possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NB that this doesn't &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; track colloquial usage, but I think it works pretty well with it.
Also if you're not sure how to tell what the emotion attaches to, may I recommend &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2UWXQDL"&gt;Focusing&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's certainly possible to worry about things without being particularly anxious about them. Sensible precautions often work like this: e.g. I lock my door because I'm worried that if I don't people might otherwise come in and steal stuff, but there's no anxiety attached to that worry because it's just something I can act on to limit the chances.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can be anxious without worry in situations when all of the potential outcomes are positive (it's also possible &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misattribution_of_arousal"&gt;to mistake excitement for anxiety&lt;/a&gt; in these scenarios, but the anxiety can be real too). If one possible outcome &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anxiety and worry are far from mutually exclusive, and indeed tend to go hand in hand, but it is worth &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html"&gt;untangling&lt;/a&gt; the two conceptually,
and even where both are present they are still different emotions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, with COVID-19, I  am &lt;em&gt;worried&lt;/em&gt; about specific outcomes - harm to people in general, harm to people I love, overall negative societal effects, but am also also COVID-19 has more or less destroyed my ability to reason about the future, and that makes me &lt;em&gt;anxious&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the COVID-19 case the anxiety feels almost more like an &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html"&gt;existential feeling&lt;/a&gt; - there's not a specific thing I'm anxious about so much as a general sense that the unknown unknowns are dwarfing the known unknowns, let alone the known knowns (the unknown knowns remain huge given how ideological responses are being). The thing that is making me anxious is the uncertainty itself, not the bad outcomes possible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Reducing worry is often more tractable than reducing anxiety, because you can reduce worry by planning. If you have a scenario you're worried about, you can ensure that you're prepared for it (e.g. COVID-19 precautions, or talking through your concerns about a situation with the people involved before you get into it). I like Chris Hadfield's advice for dealing with worry, which is "Figure out the next thing that's going to kill you" - plan for the worst, and convince yourself you can handle it. Also often what you're worrying about is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-03-09:07.html"&gt;outdated scenarios that no longer apply&lt;/a&gt;, so &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;learning to debug that can help with this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anxiety can be resolved by reducing uncertainty by making the situation more deterministic, but often that's not a good idea! &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;A certain amount of nondeterminism is often very useful&lt;/a&gt;, and many of the ways to reduce uncertainty do this by increasing the chances of failure (e.g. procrastination until it's too late to do a good job).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on any worries first, because often a lack of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; is the thing that makes uncertainty uncomfortable. Uncertainty isn't intrinsically bad, because if you're always certain you'll never learn anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See if you can reframe any of the anxiety. For example, you can be uncertain about the outcome but certain of your ability to handle it. Can you focus on that? Are there good things about the uncertainty too? Can you appreciate those as excitement? (This one rarely to never works for me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you've managed to get your anxiety down to a low enough level, it can be worth practicing a certain amount of discomfort tolerance. Anxiety isn't intrinsically bad, it may be telling you useful information about the world, so the correct amount of anxiety may be non-zero, and it's important to acknowledge that and be prepared to sit with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you've not managed to get your anxiety down to a low enough level, often me neither I'm afraid (I've got a lot better since I've acquired the "legacy code" tools). Consult someone with better advice than me and let me know what they said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>Being safe for others</title>
    <updated>2020-04-06T15:52:38+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Being safe for others&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;

&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-06&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It will come as no surprise to the regular reader of this blog that personal growth is a bit of a thing for me right now.
It is unlikely to come as a surprise (given that I'm writing about growth and run a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html"&gt;support group&lt;/a&gt;) that I'm also keen to help others with theirs.
I've had a lot of good experiences on this front recently, many of which I owe to other people, and want to help pay it forward, both to my friends and also to random people on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the skills that seems most helpful in doing this is &lt;em&gt;being safe to tell things to&lt;/em&gt;.
People are mostly OK at the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; part, and where they're not you can't really help them with that outside of a very close relationship, but everyone is lacking in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt;, and if you're to be able to provide people with a platform for growth you need to be able to extend that safety to them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is only one thing you really must do for this: Don't react badly, especially don't react judgementally, when people tell you things that they've been hiding about themself.
You need to be someone people can &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html"&gt;extend trust to&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, extremely difficult in general. If someone confesses to some truly terrible crime, of course you're going to react badly to it, no matter how highly you think of them. It doesn't matter how much good faith you're extending, some things are just too much.
Fortunately, usually it isn't this bad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm not yet sure what to advise on developing this skill, but some things that seem to help:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning good boundaries - being able to say "Actually, I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you with this" rather than trying and failing to help, or reacting defensively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;Learning to manage your own reactions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciating just how weird and diverse humanity is, and how many seemingly "unhealthy" things are actually very normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking whether it's &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-09-11:13.html"&gt;useful to have an opinion&lt;/a&gt; as to whether the thing being described is good or bad (if you're judgemental, will they stop doing it, or will they just go find someone who will encourage them to do it more?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for the underlying pain, rather than focusing on how they're conceptualising a solution to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the communication skills from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2RehhHl"&gt;the customer service survival kit&lt;/a&gt; to empathically defuse highly emotional communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of these are, of course, the skills that one learns to apply as a therapist, but I'm hopeful that more people can develop them without retraining as therapists.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What's cooking?</title>
    <updated>2020-04-07T11:17:06+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;What's cooking?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;A Recipe&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's start with a recipe, because everybody hates it when food blogs start with a long preamble before you finally get to the recipe:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raw cashew pieces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three apples (one granny smith, two... IDK something red?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raisins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allspice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Honey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Quantities left to your own judgement, but roughly I had about a 3 : 3 : 1 ratio of apples, cashews, raisins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Making this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coat the cashews in just enough oil to lubricate them (don't use too much! They'll get super oily if you do), add salt to taste, mix thoroughly, and bake at 180C for 15 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, chop the apples as finely as you can be bothered. Toss them with "an amount" of allspice (honestly I would have used cinammon but I could &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; the allspice)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take the cashews out of the oven, add the raisins and apple to them, mix thoroughly with a suitable amount of honey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise the oven to 210C and bake for another half hour (then turn the oven off and leave it while you finish making the rest of dinner, in my case a chicken, vegetable, and lentil, soup)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You may notice a couple of key features of this recipe:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a little weird&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The instructions are completely half-arsed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is, fortunately, delicious, but it will probably be tinkered with endlessly if I make it again, and I doubt I'll ever formalise it with anything so gauche as &lt;em&gt;quantities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;A Story&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As this is apparently now a food blog, it's time for a deeply personal anecdote about my relationship with this food.
It's a story in two tragedies, first &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2xXqsF2"&gt;one sort of plague&lt;/a&gt; and then another (and after all, &lt;a href="http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_11_15/"&gt;food blogging during a plague is a fine tradition&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why did I make this recipe? Well, because I had far too many of the ingredients. This is something I tend to call "forced abundance": When you have too much of a good thing and have to reorient your plans around making use of that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, we had Brexit. We still have Brexit, and we're probably going to massively self-own at a crucial pandemic-handling moment as a result of it, but last year I argued (And I still believe my argument was correct) that &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/02/you-should-be-stockpiling-food-for-brexit/"&gt;you should be stockpiling food for the event of a no deal Brexit&lt;/a&gt;. Either the food would be neutral to mildly positive to have or the food would be essential to have, and the probabilities of the latter were low but far enough from zero to be worth planning around.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, I underestimated how positive this could be, because now that we're trapped in lockdown due to COVID-19 it's really useful to have a giant larder of food supplies. As I put it, annoyingly presciently, in that post:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another scenario is to consider is that if things get unpleasant, we’ll have a situation reminscient of the London riots – it’s not that you can’t leave the house, you’d just maybe... rather not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately my prepping supplies were less sensible than my argument, and one of the things I didn't realise is how short the shelf life on some items were. In particular the cashew nuts and the raisins mentioned above are about 6 months out of date. They're mostly fine still - the cashews are a little stale, but fine as long as they're cooked. The raisins are very dry but perfectly edible. No sense at all in throwing them away, but better to use them up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, it turns out that 2.5kg of cashews and 5kg of raisins are really quite a lot of cashews and raisins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On top of this I placed an order for a fruit and veg box from &lt;a href="https://allgreens.co.uk/"&gt;allgreens&lt;/a&gt;. Allgreens allow no customisation of their boxes, and as a result I had a great deal of apples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How do I like them apples? Cooked. For some reason I'm just really not very into raw apples. Not sure why.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, long story short, I had a great many apples, cashews, and raisins to use up, and I was pretty sure that was a flavour combination that would work well, and after some cursory googling confirmed that I probably wasn't completely off base, and the above is what I came up with. It is indeed a flavour combination that works well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;An Observation&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about forced abundance is how rarely it happens in modern life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My parents have a garden, so I'm used to it. During the appropriate seasons you discover that there is, for example, such a thing as too many delicious, fresh, raspberries, and that it is perfectly feasible to fill yourself up on artichokes.
The degree and specifics of this vary from year to year, but the feeling of sometimes having too much is a thing that everyone with a garden is used to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Supermarkets don't do that to you. The only time I've ever had anything resembling forced abundance from a supermarket was the year where a Sainsbury's misjudged how many blueberries people wanted for Christmas and so on the 27th we discovered that there were a very large number of blueberries a day or two before their use by date available for about 20p per punnet. We bought a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another relatively common experience of forced abundance is leftovers - when you've made a really large quantity of something and then end up having to eat it up for a week. Especially common after Christmas or Thanksgiving if you've roasted an entire turkey for fewer people than an entire turkey is needed for (Solution: Have a better bird for your holiday meals. Turkey is fine I guess but mostly very boring).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As I discovered this week, vegetable boxes are another one. I used to have an Abel and Cole subscription and the "Oh gods what do I do with all these vegetables?" struggle was significant. Even with the allgreens boxes being purchased on demand I expect I'll still have this, because the thing about boxes is that they bundle everything together. Being out of bananas and fixing that suddenly mean that you've got a lot of tomatoes to use up too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Generically, two main things that can create forced abundance:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things coming in at a greater rate than you can use or store them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things that you already have stored that are about to go off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The apples are an example of (1), the cashews and raisins of (2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason these things don't happen with supermarkets is basically supply and demand. If a supermarket needs to get rid of something, they lower the price on it (either on individual items through reductions or sales, or more globally for in season produce and the like) until it clears. If &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; will move a product then they throw it away, which is essentially a limited version of &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/01/business/oil-prices-crash-storage-space/index.html"&gt;the price going negative&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Supply and demand and market pricing is very good at distributing abundance (it's not necessarily good at distributing it &lt;em&gt;fairly&lt;/em&gt; mind you, that may require other mechanisms), and through supermarkets we are all the beneficiaries of that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, as an individual who is not set up to sell things, we can't do this. Theoretically my parents could sell the output of their garden (and they now have an informal deal where they dump excess on a local cafe in exchange for favours in kind), but because they are not set up for selling things already it's vastly more effort than it's worth. Some years my mother tries to sell her pumpkins and even that is just not worth the trouble.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For most people, in normal times, our food supply comes from supermarkets on a fairly as needed basis this limitation doesn't really come up, because we're operating on a pull-based rather than push-based model: We decide what we need to make, informed by availability and price certainly, and acquire what we need to make it. Any surplus on the supply end is not our problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This creates what is, historically, a somewhat anomalous relationship to food: We treat ingredients as something we have free choice over rather than the starting point. Cooking is a process of creating meals, not a process of turning raw ingredients into meals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a subtle but important difference that you can see even during normalcy. There are, roughly, two types of cook:Those who decide what they're going to make before they go to the supermarket, and those who use the supermarket to find out what they're going to make (this is, of course, actually a spectrum rather than a binary). I'm very much in the latter camp, and I feel like we're having a much better time of cooking in quarantine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's nothing wrong with recipes of course, and in many ways pull-based cooking is excellent. I'd be hard pressed to argue that forced abundance is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing - it's quite annoying in some ways, and it's tellingly not something that people opt into unless created by circumstances - but it's certainly an interesting thing, serving as the culinary equivalent of a writing prompt, and it forces you in creative directions that you otherwise wouldn't have taken.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The rule of three twos</title>
    <updated>2020-04-08T16:25:23+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;The rule of three twos&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-08&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-07-10:05.html"&gt;In the last post I wrote about improvised cooking&lt;/a&gt;.
Some people find this much easier than others.
Here I thought I'd share a quick tip that usually makes it quite easy:
the rule of three twos.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The rule is very simple: If you have three flavours, each pair of which works together, then the combination of the three can probably be made to work well and be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This works well for both food and drinks, and is often the basis for a good cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This was the basis of the recipe I made the other day, because cashews/apples/raisins was reasonably certain to work (I wasn't sure about cashews and apples, but cashews are such an innocuous flavour it seemed unlikely they wouldn't).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is essentially the practical implication of the &lt;a href="https://www.georgehart.com/triad.html"&gt;incompatible food triad problem&lt;/a&gt;: Even if such a triad exists, it's really hard to find it, so most things will work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can't just mix the three things together any which way and expect it to be great, but the rule gives you a good foundation because it lets you start from something that you can be pretty sure will work.
This restricts the problem of making it great to:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out the right proportions, especially which flavour you want to dominate (e.g. the fact that that recipe had much fewer raisins than the other ingredients, or figuring out the right quantity of spirit in a cocktail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figuring out supporting flavours that you can use to accent or bridge the base three (e.g. salt and allspice in the above, bitters to add to a cocktail)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not every good meal can be produced this way of course, but that's not the point. The rule lets you produce something reliably good without worrying too much about it, which is often a useful &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html"&gt;existence proof&lt;/a&gt; to have when doing improvised cooking, and gives you safe fallbacks if you don't feel like doing anything fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Maybe everyone was right all along</title>
    <updated>2020-04-10T12:23:47+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Maybe everyone was right all along&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-10&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A common subject of mockery right now is that a lot of people are treating COVID-19 as evidence that their ideologies were right all along.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do share a certain amount of amusement over this, but would like to suggest the following counterpoint: Actually, most of these people probably &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; right all along, at least in some ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The easy example is that people calling for greater social safety nets, medical care, etc. who are now going "Hey, you know, maybe those things would have been useful in a pandemic??" are obviously right. Those things &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; have been useful in a pandemic. The pandemic genuinely is providing good evidence for why people need &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-05/spanish-government-aims-to-roll-out-basic-income-soon"&gt;universal basic income&lt;/a&gt;, and it really is a damning criticism of a lot of countries' healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Specifically what's happening here is that the pandemic is highlighting two major problems that were present all along:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people's lives are extremely financially precarious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthcare, especially emergency care and infectious disease control, is a collective problem that we cannot ethically or practically rely on individuals being able to afford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People who have built significant aspects of their ideology around these problems are in fact entirely justified in saying that the pandemic is proving them right all along, because these problems are real and major and the pandemic really is highlighting them, and there's nothing remotely surprising or controversial about pointing that out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What I'd like to suggest though is that most other examples of people saying they've been right all along are like this too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's tempting to think of ideologies in terms of what proposals they make for radically restructing society,
but I think it's more useful to start with what their &lt;em&gt;critiques&lt;/em&gt; of society are. An ideology is, first and foremost, a set of problems that you care about. The proposals made by the ideology are, largely, grounded in those critiques and designed to solve those problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Generally critiques start from a real source of pain, and a more or less accurate understanding of the world.
Sometimes that pain is one we want to consider "invalid" (e.g. it's selfish), sometimes that more or less accurate understanding of the world is less more and more less, but on the whole society is messed up in too many different ways for people to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html"&gt;nerd&lt;/a&gt; about all of them, so you end up with a lot of specialist bodies of knowledge each focused on a specific critique, so it's not surprising that this results in a lot of different ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People's intuition is that all of these ideologies can't be right at the same time, and in some sense that's true,
but I think it misunderstands the nature of ideological conflict.
Ideologies come into conflict in (at least) two different ways:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have incompatible critiques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They have incompatible solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first absolutely happens of course - e.g. white supremacist ideologies and intersectional feminist ideologies are genuinely in conflict - but I think more often than not it's the second, and it would be perfectly plausible to synthesise the two ideologies into something workable,
because what's actually happening is that they have perfectly compatible complementary critiques of society, but the solutions they proposed don't take into account the other's critiques.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It may not be obvious from the inside that this is happening, because people overidentify problems and solutions (this happens literally all the time, not just in ideological contexts), and even once you realise it's happening it may be genuinely very hard to form that synthesis, but I think until you've done the work to diagnose a conflict it can be worth assuming that this is what's happening - it makes it easier to extend empathy across ideological differences and to learn from other people's critiques of society.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Backtracking to COVID-19 this is, I think, why most people are treating it as evidence that they were right all along:
Their critiques of society were, within their own values, actually pretty accurate, in ways that COVID-19 is showcasing.
Society is constantly &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html"&gt;skirting the edge of disaster&lt;/a&gt; and COVID-19 came in and threw a spanner in the works, so a lot of the things we did to paper over issues are now fraying, and all of the problems that they were previously noticing are suddenly brought into stark relief.
As a result nobody is going to go "Actually I was wrong, this thing I thought was a problem isn't a problem after all", because the thing they were critiquing is now if anything &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, the only way COVID-19 can really change your ideological stance is by convincing you that things you had previously dismissed as non-problems are actually problems they do need to care about. We see this happening with e.g. libertarians and anarchists who are going "Actually, most of my critiques are still valid, but you know this does seem something where massive central coordinated response is helpful. BTW have you noticed that the institutions for doing so are exactly as broken as we said they were?" (We're also seeing this with some privacy advocates who are about facing and going "Wait no surveillance is good actually" but I'm less impressed with those people).
This is largely what I was suggesting was the good sort of ideological incompatibility: The underlying critiques are perfectly compatible, we just need to figure out how to put those together in a more productive way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, in short, my ideological stance has always been that we can learn a lot from people with different problems and areas of knowledge than us, and that although it's not true that the "truth lies somewhere in the middle", we probably do need to synthesise things from a wide variety of ideologies and viewpoints if we want to come to a useful conclusion that works for everyone. Fortunately, COVID-19 has proven that I've been right about this all along.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trivial irritations as inhibiting factors</title>
    <updated>2020-04-11T15:42:13+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Trivial irritations as inhibiting factors&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-11&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Historically speaking, I hate podcasts. I could tell you all sorts of reasons why they don't work for me as a medium - auditory processing issues, the fact that I don't really like receiving information in a spoken format, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've also listened to a lot of podcasts in the last week, and it turns out all of those reasons were wrong, and the actual reason that I didn't like podcasts was that I didn't own wireless headphones.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It turns out that I think podcasts as a medium are &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;. They're not great. I very much don't think they're the ideal medium for many things. But there's a lot of good information available in podcast form, so by picking out the ones that work best for me it's relatively easy to get reasonable benefit out of podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to take advantage of that benefit though two things need to hold true:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can't be something I'd rather be doing with that time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of listening to the podcast has to be smaller than the benefit, otherwise listening to it is a net negative.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So for example for (1) podcasts are a good thing to listen to in otherwise "dead" time. e.g. doing chores, during exercise, etc. because they're a good thing for occupying attention then that I wouldn't otherwise be using if that's what I want. This was always true and the benefits of them for that were always present.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But also listening to podcasts on speakers or wired headphones is just that little bit too annoying. Wired headphones to a phone in my pocket during exercise is very annoying - it constrains my movement, there's a risk of the headphones being pulled out, etc. The result was that prior to having wireless headphones it was always just a little bit too irritating for me to listen to podcasts.
As a result, having wireless headphones takes the cost-benefit of podcasts from mildly negative to mildly positive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, it turns out, is actually a bigger deal than it sounds, because once the cost-benefit analysis is positive I can start to properly get into it. I've even (gasp) &lt;em&gt;listened to podcasts on wired headphones&lt;/em&gt; and it was mostly fine, because I'd already done the work to get into it. So I think in the end the cost-benefit analysis of podcasts will be moderately positive - still not my favourite medium, but something I get a fair bit out of it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;None of my original objections were &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; exactly - they're still all things that I expect mean that podcasts will never be my favourite thing, but they were slightly missing the point because what I needed was to overcome a trivial irritation that I didn't realise was there rather than to make podcasts work better for me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intuition as search prioritisation</title>
    <updated>2020-04-12T12:17:26+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Intuition as search prioritisation&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-12&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Computers and algorithms are not an especially good model of the human mind, but they often provide nice toy models for reasoning processes. These don't necessarily capture general features of human reasoning, but they're often still useful toy models for thinking about how reason might work in particular contexts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this post I'd like to look at some such toy models and see how intuition can have a big impact on them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose we have \(N\) items, and we want to find a good one (and know a priori that at least one of them is good). We can check whether any given item is good, but it requires reasonably careful investigation in order to determine an item's goodness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's no mystery about what we have to do in in order to find a good item: We go through \(N\) items, one at a time, and keep asking "Is this one good? How about this one? This one?" until we find a good item and return it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This simplicity hides an important question though: What order do we search through the items in?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If we're lucky and get a good item first, we only need to examine one item. If we're unlucky, we might have to examine all \(N\). If \(N\) is large this may be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; expensive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, our iteration order is the major driver of how efficient this process is. It has no effect on the result of the algorithm, but it significantly impacts its performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Intuition can be thought of as the search ordering in this problem: We have some really cheap test that lets us guess whether something is good enough, and we go through the items in order of guessed-good to guessed-bad. If our guesses are remotely accurate, this will speed up the time this takes to find the item.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this stage, intuition affects only the performance, not the outcome, but in real world decision making often we are time constrained, so we might not have time to search through all \(N\) items. A &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/10/vocabulary-building-satisficing/"&gt;satisficing&lt;/a&gt; behaviour might be that rather than looking for goodness in some absolute sense, we evaluate \(k\) out of \(N\) items and pick the best among those.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is effectively the same algorithm as before, but now treated as an &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-23-15:52.html"&gt;anytime algorithm&lt;/a&gt; - we're allowing for the possibility of interrupting early and using our best result.
&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; the order of iteration is still important, because we can observe the quality over time and pick an earlier time to stop, but for essentially the same reason that it affected performance before.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This feature becomes especially important when it's not just impractical but utterly infeasible to evaluate all \(N\) possibilities.
&lt;a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10045895/1/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf"&gt;AlphaGo Zero&lt;/a&gt; is a particularly good practical instance of a real computer program working a bit like this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;AlphaGo Zero has essentially two components:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tree search, that reasons through and evaluates potential moves for their impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A neural network, that looks at the board and history and outputs a set of move probabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The tree search is the "reasoning" of the AlphaGo Zero, in that it's the bit that actually attempts to strategise and think through the implications of varying moves, but the neural network is the fast gut feel play.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In theory, AlphaGo Zero would play fine if you were to just make the neural network always pick every move at random and let the tree search be unboundedly deep. In practice, it would play fine by just sitting there generating heat and net never making a move, because trying to do a full tree search on the space of possible Go moves would take longer than the lifetime of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This means we're in the situation like the above partial search algorithm: Because are constrained on time, the quality of the moves output by the neural network will heavily influence the quality of AlphaGo Zero's decision making.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a general phenomenon that repeats over and over again: Making decisions perfectly requires unbounded amounts of time, so at some point we have to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;terminate our decision making process and just make our best guess&lt;/a&gt;, and the quality of our intuition helps us prioritise what to consider before we give up. Thus, even the most logical and well reasoned decision making process will usually be heavily dependent on intuition for the quality of its outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB this is a very &lt;a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up"&gt;working with the garage door up&lt;/a&gt; post.
Sometimes you just get a sense that there's a there there, but you're not quite sure what it is yet.
This post is an attempt to gesture vaguely in the sense of the there that may or may not be there. It probably won't quite make sense yet, because it doesn't yet make sense to &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Plus a lot of general background stuff beyond that. You don't have to read any of these to understand this post (I hope), but they vaguely are defining the cluster of what I'm thinking about right now. Also I can't promise that this post will make sense if you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; read them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Against the Grain talks about the idea of a &lt;em&gt;domus&lt;/em&gt;. The term comes from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus"&gt;the Latin word meaning home&lt;/a&gt;, but can more broadly be used to refer to a freeholding and its surrounding cultivation. It is the origin of "domestication", which can be thought of as the process of taking other species and making them suitable for inclusion in the domus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because not enough people write like mathematicians, Scott never really precisely defines what he &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; by domus in any easy to extract form, but the condensation of it in &lt;a href="https://proteviblog.typepad.com/files/notes-on-scott-against-the-grain.pdf"&gt;these notes&lt;/a&gt; is pretty good:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “domus” is an assemblage, or concatenation of multiple species and environmental 
features – landscape changes, animal pens, houses, butcher shops, blacksmiths, marketplaces 
and so on – that are put together in varying proportions. It is multi-dimensional long-term 
inherited niche construction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Scott talks more broadly about the &lt;em&gt;domus complex&lt;/em&gt; as the effect of humanity on the landscape. We don't just produce small, tightly concentrated, domestic units, but we broadly reshape the landscape around us, and have been doing so long before anything recognisable as modern agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Within this broader domus complex, the domus is more like a local increase in concentration of domestication, but the the domestication of the landscape extends out far beyond where you might naturally think of as being the boundary of human presence. The village is domesticated, certainly, but so are the forests around it where humans hunt, and possibly clear with fire, so are the places where evolution is shaped by human predation, or by escaped domesticated species (plant and animal).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it is not just the rest of the world that is shaped by domestication, but also humanity. In one sense, humanity has shaped grain to serve us. In another sense, grain has shaped humanity to propagate itself. The situation is even more murky when you look at a species like dogs, who we essentially co-evolved with to domesticate each other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1126046264125267968"&gt;previously argued&lt;/a&gt; that you can look at books in the same way as grain: In one sense we create books to serve us, but in another sense books are best seen as a replicator in their own right, using humanity as the background medium of replication.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One could look at a kind of generalised definition of a domus as this: A domus is a set of tightly co-evolved replicators, each of which are dependent on each other and the domus as a whole as a platform driving their success, and which would be significantly altered (and possibly fail entirely) by its removal from the domus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Books in the absence of humanity cannot replicate. Grain in the absence of humanity is much more subject to the vagaries of weeds, and drought. Humanity in the absence of books would find itself at a significant disadvantage compared to where we are today. Humanity in the absence of grain would starve.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As with Scott's domus complex, the boundary of a generalised domus will usually be fuzzy. There will be things that are obviously in a domus together, and things that are obviously not in a domus together, and a wide range in between. There will also likely tend to be overlapping domus which do not themselves necessarily constitute a larger domus. For example, both a large international business's culture and a city's culture might usefully be considered as domus in their own right, but are not usefully considered as a single unified domus even when the business has an office in that city - although the two domus interact, they do not interact densely enough to be usefully considered as part of the same domus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This density of interaction is key to whether it is useful to think of a set of replicators as a domus.
Replicators in a domus will create pressure on each other to become more usable to them, by "offering" services. Books create a culture of literacy by turning humans into readers. Grains create a culture of mass agriculture by turning humans into states.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In "Sorting Things Out", Bowker and Star introduce the idea of &lt;em&gt;torque&lt;/em&gt;, the twisting of time lines created by people and categorisation systems on each other: When a person interacts with a categorisation, this creates pressure on both the person (to conform) and the categorisation system (to include the person). People's behaviour and categorisation systems are both examples of replicators (they literally evolve over time, in response to replication with variation and selection), and the torque between these replicators as they interact is the process of each making the other more usable to each other. Mutual torque&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, generalising this, we might say that &lt;em&gt;torque&lt;/em&gt; is the influence between two replicators to make each other more usable to each other. A domus is thus a set of replicators that exert significant torque on each other,
thereby domesticating each other. Torque creates domestication.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Where Good Ideas Come From" is a book largely about treating innovation as an evolutionary process (It's not especially convincingly argued, but that's OK for me because I was already on board with most of its ideas and it was nice to see them sketched out a bit more). In it he describes the idea of a &lt;em&gt;platform&lt;/em&gt; - an ecosystem that essentially acts as a foundation for other things to develop on top of them. Two examples he gives of such platforms are how coral reefs create atolls, which are highly nutrient dense environments supporting a huge amount of diversity of life, and cities, which have the same function for memetic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In "The Economy of Cities", Jane Jacobs talks about how cities are essentially the driver of innovation. She also talks about how cities predate agriculture, which I think "Against the Grain" convincingly disproves (depending on what you "count" as agriculture), but I think her broader point is still sound if you replace "city" with "domus", because there really isn't a city / not-city binary. Instead a better reading of this would be that &lt;em&gt;domus density&lt;/em&gt; is a huge driver of evolutionary diversity. Any domus serves as a platform, both for the replicators currently in it and for new ones to be brought into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Jacobs talks about "import replacement", where a city starts producing goods it has previously imported, as a driver of city group. In a domus sense this also occurs as something we might call &lt;em&gt;replicator integration&lt;/em&gt;. Once, cats were not part of the domus. Then they started essentially feeding off it (by eating creatures that were parasitizing off the domus). Now cats are a thoroughly integrated part of humanity's domus complex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The main human domus complex inextricably contains memes (in the original Dawkins sense. Pictures with text on them are less load bearing although still a major feature) - ideas and complexes of ideas which replicate themselves by spreading from person to person. The memetic domus in the title of this post is really just the part of that broader domus that centers on these memetic replicators. It's not necessarily cleanly separable from the rest of the human domus complex, but it's worth considering as an object of study in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One way in which it is worth studying is cultural. As I wrote before, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html"&gt;culture is deeply contingent&lt;/a&gt;. Here the memes that we are interested in are particularly &lt;em&gt;behaviours&lt;/em&gt;. When you have a domus, people interact often enough and exert enough torque on each other, than where it is useful to synchronise behaviours to be the same, they generally will. Whenever there is a coordination problem, a domus will tend to create homogoneity through torque.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A domus will also tend to use that torque to resist change. If two previously unlinked domuses start interacting, each will induce torque on the behaviours of the other, but because changing one replicator within a domus will cause it to be less useful to the others, the within-domus torque will tend to be greater than the between-domus torque. If interactions are common enough, the two domus might eventually "merge", and eventually the within-domus torque might be enough to eventually remove the inhomogeneity, but without that the two will tend to remain separate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A particularly important feature of this when the domus contains humans (technically "human behaviours" as humans don't have to be present in their capacity as replicators for this to be relevant) is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html"&gt;legibility&lt;/a&gt; within the domus. Because of this homogenising effect, two people within the same domus will tend to make more sense to each other than people from other domus - many core assumptions about behaviour and communication will be shared and not need explaining, and many shorthands will have been developed that are useful for describing behaviour within the domus. These shorthands will be shared.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This shared legibility is related to something that Kenneth Arrow talks about in "the limits of organization". This is a book about why, if we assume that the price system is very good (which it mostly is, and as an economist Kenneth Arrow is particularly predisposed to believe that it is), why do non-market organisations form? One of the answers he presents to this is that organisations exist to lower communication costs within the organisation, which enables people to acquire information that is valuable but not worth the cost of acquiring it in a broader market economy. Thus by forming an organisation in which communication is cheaper, a number of market failures become soluble.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The mutual legibility within the domus serves a similar function. People will find it easier to communicate with each other, and so many ideas become possible to spread that would not in isolation. Essentially, the domus becomes a platform for a much richer memetic ecosystem that would not be possible without it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One example of a set of replicators that it is useful to think of as part of a memetic domus is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-18-12:24.html"&gt;the libraries of Pierre Bayard&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of various types of books, both literal and figurative, and the collective discussions we have centered around them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is all now quite far from the thought process that spawned this post, and I think I will let these ideas bed down a bit more and try to explain it more coherently and go into this thought process a bit more in a later post, but to touch on it briefly: It is useful to think of yourself as embedded in a domus with your own surrounding information architecture (your "exobrain" as I'd often think of it), and it's worth thinking about behaviours in terms of promoting the health of that domus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example my own personal memetic domus (something to make me share, something to make me like and subscribe) might contain:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thoughts I have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The conversations I have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Posts on this notebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tweets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Books I read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It may not seem natural to think of these all as replicators, and some of them are a bit of a stretch I'll grant, but they definitely all exert torque on each other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The domus forms a platform largely to the degree that it is well connected through torque, so behaviours which &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-09:44.html"&gt;promote the formation of ideas&lt;/a&gt; will largely be ones that increase torque within your personal memetic domus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An example of this, which is largely what prompted this very post, is that I've taken to dipping in and out of books and rereading bits of them to remind me of their contents. This has created significantly higher torque between thoughts and books, and (indirectly) between books and this very notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spock is a Lie</title>
    <updated>2020-04-14T13:56:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Spock is a Lie&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-14&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of people's model of peak intelligence is something like Spock (Star Trek Spock, not developmental psychology Spock): Freed from the petty constraints of petty human emotions, one can become a being of pure logic who can reason perfectly as a result.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are two basic problems with this goal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotions are how you assign value, and it doesn't really matter how good you are at reasoning if you don't have preferences over outcomes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also freeing yourself of emotion makes you very bad at reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My favourite representation of Vulcans comes from Diane Duane's &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2VqGmjn"&gt;Spock's World&lt;/a&gt;, where she presents the version of Vulcan logic that makes the most sense to me: Vulcans aren't intrinsically logical, we're just seeing the results of a world-wide religious norm of good behaviour. Vulcans absolutely have emotions, it would just be considered extremely rude for them to show them, and as part of that they've got &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;very good at managing them&lt;/a&gt;. The Vulcans who wouldn't get on board with this religious program left and became Romulans (Romulans also have their own norms around emotion management, but they tend to be more around staying ruthlessly secretive in the face of totalitarian opression. Or follow the path of Absolute Candor and tell everyone about their feelings as part of their assassin training).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Vulcans are thus basically a more emotionally healthy version of the British: The British (especially the British upper middle class) also consider it rude to have emotions in public, but nobody taught us how to manage them, so the result is that most of us are neurotic messes. Vulcans presumably know better than to do this, so probably meditate on their feelings and write emo poetry about them in private.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is a post about reasoning and emotions, not about Spock's emo poetry about Kirk (I confess I've never actually read any Spock/Kirk, because Kirk does nothing for me and Spock does little).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Damasio's book &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2xkCetv"&gt;Descartes' Error&lt;/a&gt; lays out some of the evidence for this in practice: Damage which affects emotional processing usually results in people being unable to make good decisions, in large part because of inability to prioritise.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From a more theoretical standpoint, there are two major obvious candidates for the role of emotion in reasoning:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intuition is a fundamentally emotional experience, and is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-12-11:35.html"&gt;essential for good reasoning under time constraints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cognitive dissonance is an emotion, and paying attention to it is a major guide for improving our reasoning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Carol Tavris talks about cognitive dissonance in &lt;a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2018/07/09/episode-1-carol-tavris-on-mistakes-justification-and-cognitive-dissonance/"&gt;Episode 1 of Mindscape&lt;/a&gt; and it's very good. She also has a book about this, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2XzN7lz"&gt;Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me)&lt;/a&gt; that I've not yet got around to reading. The really short version is this though: Cognitive dissonance is the unpleasant feeling of noticing yourself holding two contradictory beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cognitive dissonance is not intrinsically a bad thing - noticing that contradiction &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; feel bad, in that you should be driven to reduce it, but because we're all so bad at discomfort tolerance we tend to overreact to cognitive dissonance and as a result come to bad conclusions where we justify having been right all along (often this is learned in a social environment where mistakes were &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;unsafe&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The correct response to cognitive dissonance is to treat it as useful information, and to allow it to feed a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; to be more correct, without overreacting to it. This is hard, and it's easy to fail in either direction: We can ignore the cognitive dissonance altogether, which leaves us with no impetus to improve our reasoning, or we can overreact to it and double down on our existing position, which leaves us stuck in a bad reason.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, epistemic competence (being good at acquiring true knowledge) is fundamentally dependent on emotion management skills: We need to be aware of our emotions, and we need to experience them as safe, otherwise we will end up stuck with bad beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
