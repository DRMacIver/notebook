    <title>Capabilities can be coerced</title>

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Capabilities can be coerced&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If I can force you to take an action, that implies that you are able to take that action.
The converse of this is that you are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; able to take that action, I cannot force you to do it.
Thus, your inability gives you a certain power over me - you force me to plan in ways that compensate for this inability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The classic example of this is how to win a game of Chicken (theoretically. I do not recommend you do this).
Chicken is played as follows: Two people drive their cars directly at each other. The one who swerves, loses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is a simple winning move in Chicken: Visibly clamp your steering wheel, or otherwise remove your ability to swerve in a way that is visible to your opponent (the visibility part is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; important).
Now your opponent knows that you not just won't swerve you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; swerve, so they are forced to swerve instead.
You win (unless your opponent has done the same thing at the same time of you, in which case you both lose very badly).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thomas Schelling goes into this and similar things in great and illuminating detail in &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3a7N3MM"&gt;The Strategy of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;, but this example has the core of it: When interacting with someone in a situation of conflict, the other party will choose their strategy based only on the moves that you can make, so removing the ability to make certain moves can cause them to choose strategies that are more advantageous to you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Conflicts don't have to be quite as adversarial as the game of Chicken. Consider something like choosing a meal. Suppose you have a reasonably strong preference against eating meat. Chances are you're often going to be coerced (explicitly or implicitly) into eating meat a lot more often than you want. If, instead, you tell people that you're vegetarian and &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; eat meat, that coercion goes down significantly (not to zero, sadly, but you've got a stronger argument to make against them when they try).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(This is, of course, often also a game of chicken. More specifically a game of eating chicken).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is also why today's favour is tomorrow's obligation: Once you have demonstrated the ability to perform the favour, now any future refusal to do it is evidence that you are choosing not to do it because it is known that you can do it, so the cost of refusal is now significantly higher.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is, I think, at the core of a number of identities. As I've previously written, &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/06/on-not-quite-fitting/"&gt;I'm something of a skeptic of the universality of "born this way"&lt;/a&gt; for sexualities (I'm agnostic as to whether some people's sexuality is biologically determined - it could well be the case, certainly, and I don't think it would be useful to argue with individuals' experiences of this, but at the very least I doubt it's the majority case).
However, it's a very useful &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; tool, because it allows you to credibly claim that people have to accept you as you are, because you do not have the option to be otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On what is, in some sense, the other side of the fence, I think this also explains many popular uses of evopsych (evolutionary psychology, that is to say explaining psychological features of behaviour by arguing that they were evolutionarily advantageous).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Evopsych has one really compelling "feature": It's so underdetermined and so hard to verify that you can use it to explain just about anything you want.
That's not to say that evolution didn't influence our psychology. Of course it did. But the specific ways in which evolution influenced our psychology are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard to test for, and most evopsych arguments don't constitute anything remotely resembling a reasonable standard of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result if you are, say, a man who experiences a particular socially constructed version of masculinity that you're quite attached to and don't want to do the work of changing,
evopsych is &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; useful for you, because it lets you make the born this way argument - so sorry, can't possibly change this behaviour, it's just hardwired into us.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the internet seems to have iterated this observation to its logical conclusion, and we are now mostly credibly signalling that we are just unable to accept evopsych arguments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubiquitous Incommensurability</title>
    <updated>2020-04-17T10:40:38+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Ubiquitous Incommensurability&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-17&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We were talking in &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/jm97tDN"&gt;bookchat&lt;/a&gt; about favourite books the other day, and how difficult some people find the problem of listing, say, your top ten favourite books.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I claim the reason that this question is hard is that it's actually impossible, and not in a good way, because even within a category such as books, many things are incommensurable - it doesn't really make sense to compare them in such a way as to say that one is definitively better than another.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to illustrate this, let me tell you about two of my favourite books. &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2VdFtMd"&gt;Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2yiOQBs"&gt;A Civil Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sorting Things Out is a nonfiction book about the way classification systems are developed and how this affects the people interacting with or being classified by them. A Civil Campaign is a book late in a space opera series that is mostly a romantic comedy about marriage and edible bug byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both of these are favourite books of mine in the following senses:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My life is significantly improved by having read them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would unambiguously recommend them to anyone who thought they sounded appealing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no book I strictly prefer to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which of these books do I like better? I don't think the question makes sense.
Each book serves a very different role for me, and those roles are not at all interchangeable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is an idea in economics of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference"&gt;revealed preferences&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that preferences can be inferred from behaviour. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem"&gt;Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility Theory&lt;/a&gt; uses a similar idea to attach a single scalar utility value to a set of things being chosen over. These may both be true in some sense, but a naive adoption of them hides something very important: How incredibly context sensitive choices between objects are.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You might imagine that you can find out which of these books I prefer by asking me to make decisions, but the problem is that which book I choose will be heavily influenced by how you ask the question.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some possible variants:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I had to give away one of these books, which would I pick? A Civil Campaign, because Sorting Things Out costs more to replace. (Advantage: Sorting Things Out)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I were given an extra copy of one of these books, which would I pick? A Civil Campaign again, because I know many more people who would enjoy it than the former and I'd gift that on. (Advantage: A Civil Campaign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I could only ever read one of these books again, which would I pick? Sorting Things Out, because I use and refer to its ideas much more often. (Advantage: Sorting Things Out)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I were stuck on a desert island with one of these books, which would I pick? A Civil Campaign, because it's much more emotionally comforting to reread and I'm not likely to be up to much more than that on a desert island. (Advantage: A Civil Campaign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One way to think of this is in terms of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency"&gt;pareto optimality&lt;/a&gt;: You can only count a book as better than another if it is better in all degrees. I think this is too strong - for example I'd consider either of these books better than, say, The Tao of Pooh, because I consider the latter to be a dreadful book that I would not recommend to anyone. Are there senses in which The Tao of Pooh is better than either of these books? Yeah, probably. It's more accessible than Sorting Things Out for example, but I would still say Sorting Things Out is the unambiguously better book.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I think it is still true that many pairs of books are &lt;em&gt;incommensurable&lt;/em&gt; - you cannot readily say that one of these things is better than the other, because "better" is so context dependent. Further, nothing about this is book specific - the same is true for meals, films, people, and almost everything else. Context is important a driver of preference between objects as the objects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can certainly demand that I reduce those contexts to probabilities, and make decisions about what I would prefer in each context to reveal my preferences, in order decide which one I strictly prefer by comparing the resulting subjective utilities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To this demand, I offer the following rebuttal: Nope. Shan't.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Dust Motes and Electric Plugs&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-18&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the last post I talked about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html"&gt;incommensurability&lt;/a&gt;,
how in general you can't compare things and say that one is better than another.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely true, but the reason (that context matters) is important: Without context, you can't say one thing is better than another. With context, you're probably going to have to choose. That choice doesn't have to be stable, it &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;doesn't even have to be deterministic&lt;/a&gt;, but you're still going to have to choose, because not choosing is often the same as choosing by default to go with the status quo.
That may be fine sometimes, but often the status quo isn't so great.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem"&gt;Trolley Problem&lt;/a&gt; is very annoying, but one of the reasons it is very annoying is that it deliberately strips the decision making of context.
Implicit in the trolley problem is that you &lt;em&gt;can't ask questions&lt;/em&gt;. Variations are tried to tease out your moral intuition (the fat man version, the surgeon version, etc), but within the frame of a particular trolley problem you are not allowed to defer your decision making to context.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, in trolley-like situations you are going to have to choose. You have access to the context, so you don't have to choose contextless, but you do have to choose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://robots.law.miami.edu/2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MoralMachineMonster.pdf"&gt;Why the moral machine is a monster&lt;/a&gt; is a paper I really like which talks about the application of the trolley problem to self-driving cars and why you shouldn't: Software isn't ethics, it's policy, and if you consider the behaviour of self-driving cars having implemented a version of the trolley problem, you need to consider not just the effect of individual ethical choices, but also the way people shape their behaviour knowing that cars implement those choices.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general this is what policy is: Decisions that are made in the absence of a specific context, to be implemented in specific cases using context only to the degree that it is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html"&gt;legible&lt;/a&gt; to the policy makers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/"&gt;safety in complex systems literature&lt;/a&gt; is a good source of evidence around how people behave in the presence of policy: Which is that they often violate it. Some of this is &lt;a href="https://danluu.com/wat/"&gt;normalization of deviance&lt;/a&gt;, and some of this is because policy can never be sufficiently powerful and flexible to adapt to local context.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, sometimes you have to set policy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is particularly true with coordination problems. When it comes to walking you can rely on &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html"&gt;people deciding which side of the path to walk on&lt;/a&gt; but with cars you actually want to set some policy as to which side of the road to drive on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a harmless example because it doesn't actually matter which side you pick, but there are other less harmless ones where you're forced to make hard trade offs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of less harmless ones.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another annoying thought experiment is &lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wYTFWY3LKQCnAptN/torture-vs-dust-specks"&gt;torture vs dust specks&lt;/a&gt;, which asks whether it is better to torture someone horribly for 50 years or to give each of an inconceivably large (more than the number of atoms in the universe by some inconceviably large number of orders of magnitude) a speck of dust in their eye. Yudkowsky thinks the answer is obvious, and so do I: The answer is that the question is bad, and he should feel bad for posing it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That being said, I reluctantly agree with what I presume is his position, that the torture is probably the preferable option, and we can see this with a (somewhat) less ridiculous variant: Would you rather one random person on earth have their eye painfully removed, or every single person on earth have a slightly annoying dust speck in their eye?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Note: This is a question of &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/28/contra-askell-on-moral-offsets/"&gt;axiology&lt;/a&gt;, not of ethics. I'm, for the moment, not asking you to choose policy or make a decision, I'm just asking which of these situations are better).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is obvious: Removing a random eye is better.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are currently about 7.5 billion people on the earth. Suppose each of those people had to choose between touching their eye to remove a minor inconvenience, and having a one in 7.5 billion chance of losing that eye.
Would they take it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course they would. People touch their eyes &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. COVID-19 is teaching us just how often we do it. This has potentially bad consequences, such as disease transmission, and eyes can definitely get infected to the point of losing them as a result of being touched. It's not very likely, but it doesn't have to be very likely for this to matter, all we have to argue is that people shouldn't credibly believe that there's a less than one in 7.5 billion chance of something at least as bad as losing an eye to happen as a result, and I think the reality is that the answer is that there's a significantly greater than one in 7.5 billion chance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with policy?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, consider &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets"&gt;electrical plug design&lt;/a&gt;. A friend of a friend once pointed out that there's an interesting trade off implicitly being made in the design of the UK sockets. UK sockets are among the safest in the world from the point of view of preventing electrocution - it's really very hard to electrocute yourself on a UK socket (though a sufficiently dedicated small child with exactly the right mix of ingenuity and stupidity can do it, as I learned the hard way). On the other hand, a UK plug can lie on its back in a way that makes it essentially a caltrop, and some people will step on that and hurt their foot (possibly falling over and injuring themselves badly! This too is a fatality risk, especially for older people).
So, here we are presented with a policy trade off between injured feet and electrocutions. You can't play a "Would you rather?" with these exactly, but people confronted with policy do absolutely have to trade these two off against each other. You can potentially improve both, but it will likely come at the cost of something else - possibly time and money as you roll out a new standard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another example of this is speed limits. Why is the speed limit not 20mph everywhere in a city? Why are cars allowed in cities at all? Either of banning cars or reducing the speed limit to 20mph everywhere would have a significant impact on mortality rate, but it would also be incredibly inconvenient for a lot of people, so currently policy is prioritising a large amount of inconvenience against a certain amount of death.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We're also seeing this in COVID-19 planning. Closing schools is an example where policy has chosen a truly vast amount of inconvenience against a relatively small amount of death (possibly partly because the error bars on "relatively small" are really quite large). I'm not saying if I think they're right or wrong to do so (this isn't a thing it's &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-09-11:13.html"&gt;useful for me to have an opinion on&lt;/a&gt;), but I sure am glad I don't have to make the choice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, &lt;a href="https://mindsarentmagic.org/"&gt;Paul Crowley&lt;/a&gt; convinced me that the optimal decision for this is always going to take the form of a linear trade off between these. Say, we might choose that 1000 inconvenienced parents is worth 1 death. The argument only works if the set of available policies is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set"&gt;convex&lt;/a&gt; but it usually is. I don't think we'll necessarily be able to make good choices about those trade off parameters, andindeed think usually trying to make good choices is probably impossibly hard work, but it's probably often worth thinking about lower and upper bounds, especially ones that are revealed by your preferences in other ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example there are, say, about 3 million cars in London (it's a bit lower than in terms of ownership but people also drive in. This isn't a precise measure). There are also about 100 road fatalities per year in London. So at the bare minimum we've decided that moderately inconveniencing 3 million people for 4 days is worse than a single death. It's not obvious that COVID-19 policy is consistent with that trade off, but equally there are arguments that it shouldn't be (policy during a crisis needn't reflect policy outside that crisis).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am not a utilitarian. I think it's a bad ethical framework, and people shouldn't use it for individual ethical decisions, but I am increasingly coming around to the view point that it might be a good ethical framework for designing policy. You need to be careful about this, because &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/11/shaping-the-world/"&gt;trying to impose simple rules on complex systems often destroys them&lt;/a&gt;, but if you're going to set policy this is probably the sort of thinking that you need to engage in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the difficulties with this is that it implies that our individual ethical decision making process should be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; different from those of people setting policy. The result will often be that they do things we regard as outrageous like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life"&gt;attaching monetary value to a human life&lt;/a&gt;, which they need to do in order to make policy like this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This seems bad, but I increasingly feel that it seems bad for the same reason that national debt looks horribly fiscally irresponsible if you look at it like individual debt: We're trying to analogise between two things that are actually much more different than they look at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Notes on becoming a cis man&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-19&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please note: I ask for clemency and/or good faith reading of this post. This is stuff that is difficult to talk about without stepping on someone's toes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Required prior reading:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1251790486341390338"&gt;Lexie's thread about why cis people should be allowed to think about gender too&lt;/a&gt; (to be possibly replaced with a link to a blog post later if they write one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/the-inner-sense-of-gender/"&gt;The Inner Sense of Gender&lt;/a&gt; (this was in fact written based on a conversation with Lexie)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/06/on-not-quite-fitting/"&gt;On Not Quite Fitting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In particular this tweet from Lexie's thread is relevant:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I have cis friends who have done introspection of their gender, and are now more sure that they’re cis – but talking about it gets shouted down as “you’re trans but you haven’t realised yet”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm one of those cis friends, and I thought it might be useful to talk about this process given that it's not one that gets talked about much.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First off, some politics: My basic stance on transition is that if you want to do it, go for it, you're entitled to. There may be some sort of intrinsic transness vs cisness, I don't know, but I don't think it matters for the purposes of who gets to count as eligible to transition. Bodily autonomy is important, gender is a thing that it is good for people to experiment with if they want to, and people should be trusted to make their own decisions in this space.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In particular&lt;/em&gt; while I would never suggest this about anyone in particular (and indeed don't have anyone in particular I even suspect of this) I'm morally certain that there are people out there who are at about the same point on the cis/trans spectrum as I am and have decided to transition. That's cool by me. It would both be inappropriate of me to police that, and also I wouldn't want to police that. It's just a thing that they're entitled to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I personally decided that transition wasn't the most useful route for me to go down and took an alternative path, but there's no reason other people should make the same decisions as me even presented with broadly the same experience of gender as I have.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another political-ish note: I'm going to be disagreeing with some things some trans people say in this post. This can be dicey, but I feel reasonably confident in doing so because what I'm going to be disagreeing with his how they interpret &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; lived experience, not how they interpret theirs. Also, almost all of these are things that I've also talked extensively with other trans people about and largely agreed with them on - there's no broad consensus that I'm disagreeing with, we're just all figuring this out together.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, on to the main point of this post...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I wrote "the inner sense of gender" I described myself as "almost certain that I am cis". This fluctuated a bit (both up and down) in the interim, and various people predicted that I would in the end decide I was trans, but I have largely largely settled on certainty that I am cis, at least to the degree that I think the question still makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I'm not sure it makes sense is that I'm increasingly unconvinced that gender is really a thing.
Many things are &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/gendering/"&gt;gendered&lt;/a&gt;, and that the orientation of gendering is kinda defined by the statistical differences between some sort of "archetypal cis" men and women, but that doesn't neatly fall into saying that there is any one thing that we might call gender. Gender isn't a linear progression from man to woman, it's more like a big ball of biopsychosocial... stuff. This is a lot of why my politics of transition are basically "bodily autonomy, end of story" (the other part is that gatekeeping is not a thing that has historically covered itself in glory in this space).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But, to be concrete: My pronouns will remain he/him, I'm unlikely to engage in any major gender defiance regarding my aesthetic, and it's basically certain that I will never attempt any sort of medical transition (I'll confess to a certain amount of curiosity about the effects of hormones, but it really is just curiosity). To a very large degree I will continue to play the social role of man, and I will become increasingly comfortable with that (and also comfortable with ditching the bits of masculinity that I think are bullshit).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I still think if we had magic Culture level body changing tech I would experiment with other gender presentations, and I still think there's a decent chance that I might end up choosing a feminine or androgynous presentation as my default given that option, but I'd also like to be able to fly and the level of emotional significance these two facts hold is broadly equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What's changed?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, Lexie has been writing about &lt;a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2020/04/adventures-in-embodiment/"&gt;embodiment&lt;/a&gt; recently. I've been part of some of the conversations that prompted that, and have been working on it myself too. I've, sadly, not achieved the same level of euphoria, but I don't think this is a gender thing I just think euphoria is hard emotion for me to access (I'm working on it). I've specifically been working on it in the context of Focusing and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;my work on feelings&lt;/a&gt;, which has been extraordinarily helpful. I've also been working on it in the context of Alexander Technique and some of what I've been learning from that in the context of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html"&gt;letting my body drive&lt;/a&gt; (one of the minor personal annoyances of the pandemic is that it's interrupted my study of this).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One side effect of this is that it has resulted in a great deal more comfort in my body, and reduced my dissociation from it. A lot of things that previously looked kinda like gender dysphoria turned out to be fantasies of "If only my body were completely different I'd be able to connect to it", but it turns out to be perfectly possible for me to connect to my body as it is, and to enjoy my experience of it, it's just quite hard work to acquire the skillset. well maybe it would be easier (certainly it's a common reaction to going on estrogen, but I suspect that some of that is genuinely just that estrogen makes it easier to connect to your embodied emotional state).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This also ties in to a lot of trauma. A thing that I saw on Twitter the other day (I don't want to refind the tweet because it's a general theme and I don't want to pick on her in particular) was a trans woman saying that one of the reasons why she knew she was trans was that "cis men don't typically experience their masculinity as traumatic" and... I'm sorry to report that this is not true. I'm not going to say that we experience exactly the same sort of traumas from it as trans women do (I'd be very surprised if we do, but I'd also be very surprised if there weren't some large overlap). Some of this is that &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/"&gt;norm acquisition in general is traumatic&lt;/a&gt;, some of that is that many of our norms around masculinity are really quite bad.
Going through masculinity training just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; traumatic. I expect the same is true for going through femininity training, though the traumas are different.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of my specific traumas around this are that many masculine norms are very violent, both literally and figuratively, and are quite damaging to be coerced into. Current western masculine norms are also very homophobic. This is both a problem if you're not actually straight (which I'm not), and if you just happen to have some more feminine traits (I perform masculinity reasonably well in some ways and quite badly in others - for example I'm much more into talking about feelings than I think even the average woman, let alone the average man).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, gender non-comformance is punished (both by people of the same gender and the opposite), and almost nobody is perfectly gender conformant, so most people will have gender related traumas. Unpacking some of mine was essential for acquiring a healthier relationship with masculinity (and part of that healthier relationship is boundaries! I'm now much happier saying "No, fuck off, that's a stupid way to be a man. Shan't." to the worse bits).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The final aspect for me has been sex. I've been having a lot of it over the last year or two, and it's been very helpful. I don't plan to go into details here, but I'll note a couple significant features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First off, lets talk about autogynephilia. I basically agree with Scott Alexander on this: &lt;a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/10/autogenderphilia-is-common-and-not-especially-related-to-transgender/"&gt;Autogenderphilia is common and not especially related to transgender&lt;/a&gt;. I've had more than a few fantasies about myself as a woman. I've had more than a few fantasies about myself as a man. I am reasonably gender flexible in fantasy. It's fun and I don't intend to stop. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html"&gt;Gender is sexy&lt;/a&gt; and fantasies are supposed to be sexy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you don't realise that this is a thing, it can be very confusing, and the way that literally everybody talks about it (from "autogynephilia isn't real" to "autogynephilia is the main reason people are trans". Both seem to be obviously false) is extraordinarily unhelpful for making sense of a perfectly healthy and common experience.
People do a lot of things in fantasies that they don't especially want to do in real life, and turning this into a whole big thing is a great way to confuse people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Secondly, a lot of gender related traumas are connected to sex. I don't want to go into details here, but they definitely were for me (it's less dramatic than you might be imagining from that). There is a lot of shame connected up with masculinity and desire, and acquiring a whole bunch of emotions skills while also having a whole bunch of sex was a great way to expose, confront, and defuse those.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, for me at least having a penis is fairly central to my experience of masculinity (I'm aware that this is complex for many trans people, so treat this as a personal claim, but I expect it's a personal claim a lot of cis men would make), so uh getting comfortable with using it was a pretty good way of getting comfortable with masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, sex ties in a lot to embodiment. In many ways the key to good sex is to embody well during it, so sex works very well for providing the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; for growth in this space (of course, finding people you feel &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safe&lt;/a&gt; with is equally important here).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;None of this has added up to me suddenly being completely clear or comfortable with my own gender or body, but I'm vastly more so than I've historically been, and I've acquired the skill set and the understanding that allows me to continually improve on that over time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, at this point, I am reasonably comfortable in saying that yes I've thought about my gender a lot and I have concluded that I am a cis man, and that I am confident that the more work I do in this space the more thoroughly I will come to understand and embody that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Accelerator/Brake Model</title>
    <updated>2020-04-20T16:07:20+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;The Accelerator/Brake Model&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-20&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I recently read &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2VOS9IK"&gt;Come As You Are&lt;/a&gt;, a book about sexuality (primarily women's sexuality, but it mostly works for everyone).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is by far the most &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html"&gt;annoying&lt;/a&gt; book that I will nevertheless recommend. It was about 50% stuff I already knew (which I only skimmed but seemed pretty good), but the other 50% contained a lot of useful ideas that helped make sense of some things I only partially knew. It was also 100% annoying and I hated the author's writing style. I will grant I am not in the target audience for it (it is primarily written for women), but the friend who recommended it was a woman and she also hates the writing style so I don't think that's why, I just think it's objectively very annoying (especially if you're not from the USA).
Nevertheless, it was on balance very worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing that was particularly helpful was the brake/accelerator model for sexual arousal. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The model is very simple: There are two systems, the Sexual Excitation System (SES), the accelerator, and the Sexual Inhibition System (SIS), the brake.
The SES is what turns you on, the SIS is what turns you off.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're currently not interested in sex and you'd like to be, you need to understand which of these is at play:
It might be that your accelerator isn't being pushed by the current sexual context, or it might be that something is pressing hard on your brake.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Different people have different levels of sensitivity on each of the brake and accelerator. On average women have much more sensitive brakes (i.e. are much easier to turn off) and men have much more sensitive accelerators (i.e. are much more easy to turn on), but there's a lot of individual variation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the least helpful things you can do is make a mistake about which system is in play. It doesn't help to try to turn someone on if their foot is slammed hard on the brake, and it doesn't help to try to make someone comfortable and at ease if they're already fine and the problem is just that the context isn't at all arousing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The former is particularly bad, because pressure is one of the things most likely to activate someone's brakes, because it creates negative emotional association with the whole experience. It's also particularly common, because people (especially people who have relatively insensitive brakes, like most guys) often don't realise that the brake is a potential problem at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since reading about the brake/accelerator model I've been seeing it everywhere. I think a lot of motivation is like this, where there are things that we really want to do (the accelerator is on hard) but also procrastinate hard because there's a huge ugh field around the thing and we find it massively hard (so are the brakes) and we just end up with the gearbox in our head grinding.
In the same way as with sex, trying to want to do the thing even more isn't going to help, and treating it as an issue of motivation will just cause one to build up even more guilt and shame around the subject, making it even more aversive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This likely also ties in to the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; model of growth, where desire acts as the accelerator and a lack of safety acts as the brake (and indeed a lack of safety is often a major brake activator in a sexual context).
Given &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-19-10:52.html"&gt;the context&lt;/a&gt; in which I've been thinking about a lot of the personal growth work, it's probably not entirely a coincidence that these track.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Does a fish have a face?</title>
    <updated>2020-04-21T08:44:15+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Does a fish have a face?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-21&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm trying a new thing today, which is to integrate my daily notebook practice, my daily rereading practice, and a bit of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;randomization of decision making&lt;/a&gt;. I don't plan to do this every day, but I may do it more often.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The basic mechanism:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I pick a book of my choosing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I generate a page number uniformly at random from the main book contents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I pick an interesting passage and copy it out here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I then write something inspired by it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If this takes off I'll probably build some tooling into the notebook for getting me to do this properly but for now I'm mostly hand cranking it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is partly inspired by having recently-ish been listening to &lt;a href="https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/"&gt;Harry Potter and the Sacred Text&lt;/a&gt;. I'm deeply indifferent to Harry Potter but have been enjoying their sacred text reading techniques. This process in particular is very loosely inspired by their (in turn somewhat loosely interpreted) practice of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina"&gt;Lectio Divina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today's reading comes from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3exHrih"&gt;Finding Our Sea Legs&lt;/a&gt;, page 126:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he hedges his bets when it comes to dogs, it is hard to imagine Levinas having much time for the idea that a fish might have a face, or the idea that I could be infinitely responsible for a fish. Fish, as far as we human beings are concerned, are more alien to us than the stranger who knocks on our door, or the dog who wags his tail in greeting. They move in a different element, they have no lungs, their blood is cold, not warm, they do not sleep. And yet, while they may not have faces in the sense that Levinas means, they still hav efaces, in the ordinary everyday sense: We can look them in the eye, and these denizens of another world can look back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This might seem like a strange passage (of course fish have faces) but the idea of a "face" in this context is more about our experience of the other as a person. Backtracking to earlier in the book (pages 52-53) we have the following passage:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This curious and seemingly paradoxical idea of the 'face' is that the heart of Levinas's phenomenology of ethics. When we encounter the face of another [our relationship] is 'straightaway ethical.' When I encounter another person, I find myself responsible for them - I find myself unable to do anything other than to respond to them &lt;em&gt;as&lt;/em&gt; another person - whether I like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So the question of whether a fish "has a face" is about whether our interactions with a fish have this phenomenological character: Do we treat a fish as a subject of ethical experience?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Experiences on this tend to differ, both by person and by context. Many people are vegetarian precisely because they experience animals as ethically relevant, and I know one person who as a child became vegetarian in a way that they literally framed as not wanting to eat anything with a face, a category in which they included fish.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don't consider fish to be all that ethically relevant (oddly, I consider animals more ethically relevant than fish and yet I eat animals and mostly don't eat fish. This is primarily for environmental reasons though). I will not mourn the death of a fish. And yet, encountering a fish out of water, gasping on dry land, it is hard not to feel sorry for it.
In the abstract, I don't care about the fish, but confronted with the actual reality of the fish and its suffering, it is hard not to experience it as ethically relevant, as having a face.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Almost (I may have been subconsciously inspired in my choice of book) entirely coincidentally, yesterday I was listening to &lt;a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/02/18/episode-34-paul-bloom-on-empathy-rationality-morality-and-cruelty/"&gt;the Mindscape podcast episode with Paul Bloom&lt;/a&gt;, the author of &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2xCBEYd"&gt;Against Empathy&lt;/a&gt; (which I haven't read).
His essential argument is that this empathic experience leads us astray from good ethical behaviour. It causes us to overfocus on the individual in front of us - this empathy is what causes us to treat the fish as ethically relevant even if we don't "rationally" believe it to be. It's what causes us to be kind to our neighbour but ignore millions of people living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's also what causes us to overvalue people like us and undervalue people different to us - it's much easier to be empathic to someone whose lived experience we can easily understand, and if we tie our ethics to our empathy then we will tend to prioritise those like us and neglect the Other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, one can bite this philosophical bullet and say that yes we should be rational in our ethics but also we should consider fish as ethically relevant. This is how you end up with things like &lt;a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/wild-animal-suffering/"&gt;Effective Altruists who are very concerned about wild animal suffering&lt;/a&gt;. It's possibly they're right - I don't agree with their concerns, but I don't think they're in principle invalid.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do think he has a point, and that a certain amount of rationality and deliberation in ethics is important, but I think too much of that will drive us towards utilitarianism, which is more like &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-18-11:10.html"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; than the sort of living ethics that I think improves our behaviour in day to day life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's worth using rationality as a tool to improve our ethical behaviour, but &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html"&gt;emotion is key to effective rationality&lt;/a&gt;, and empathy and the experience of the other is a crucial tool in navigating any sort of rational ethics.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Power, baby, power</title>

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Power, baby, power&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-22&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm continuing the theme of notebook posts prompted by random passages from books. I've also decided to deliberately do this on books that aren't from my daily rereading practice to try and use it to integrate some of the books I read less often into my &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-13-11:35.html"&gt;memetic domus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Today's reading comes from "I'm very into you", which is a collection of correspondences between &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Acker"&gt;Kathy Acker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Wark"&gt;McKenzie Wark&lt;/a&gt;. This section comes from Page 59. I also randomly selected a line (line 8) because Acker apparently hates paragraphs and this made it hard to select a passage manually.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember going to some Pomo conference Sylvère had a hand in, the early days, and that creep [Bernard Henri] Levy gives a speech (after Sollers has done his usual blather) all about Eve coming out of the rib of Adam, and therefore and therefore... So XXXXXX, very beautiful, asks him a question. Then she disappears. An hour or two later, she reappearing, we ask XXXXXX where she's been. "With Levy." "Why?" "Power, baby, power."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Two things most strike me about this exchange:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unsurprising, despite how nice it would be to imagine that human nature doesn't work this way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It strikes me as very gendered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm interested in unpacking the gendered nature of it. I can just about imagine (possibly inaccurately) the script playing out this way if both people involved were women, or both people involved were men, but the thing I can't imagine is it playing out that way if the speaker was a woman and XXXXXX was a man.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Specifically what I can't imagine about it is not that a male XXXXXX wouldn't have been attracted to the powerful woman, but that he would so freely admit it. I genuinely don't know whether it's typical for men to experience power as attractive in a woman (my guess would be yes, but I don't really understand either men or attraction well enough to predict this confidently), but it definitely feels off script for men to &lt;em&gt;admit&lt;/em&gt; that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My impression is that the official cultural script for men being attracted to powerful women is that it's a shame/submission thing. The domme is the official script for the powerful woman who wields power in a sexy manner, and an intrinsic part of the sexiness of this script is partly that you're going off the official gendered script.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have at least two easily available hypotheses for why this is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power is coded masculine (perhaps because of a mix of patriarchy and more general &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/gendering/"&gt;gendering&lt;/a&gt;), so power intrinsically feeds in to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html"&gt;competent performance of a masculine aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power is just attractive in general and men are supposed to pretend it's not because of masculine bullshit about how we're supposed to be the ones having power over others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A third possibility is that I'm just wrong and this would have played out exactly the same way when gender flipped. I don't &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; this is the case, but even if it is I'm interested in where I've got these scripts from.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One reason power might be intrinsically sexy is its streamlining nature for a lot of the process of generating attraction. In the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-31-09:52.html"&gt;mutual escalation&lt;/a&gt; that is flirting, one of the things that slows it down is a safety aspect - not so much physical safety (also that, but that's not the thing that's directly relevant here). People are hesitant in escalation because of fear of rejection and consequences, and power acts as a certain shield to that. Power essentially lets you take shortcuts in the flirting process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of those shortcuts are bad but work, because they involve violating boundaries because you know you can get away with it. Violating boundaries is another of those things which it would be nice to pretend doesn't work but actually does - the reason not to do it is &lt;em&gt;unethical&lt;/em&gt;, not that it doesn't work. e.g. just kissing someone fairly early on in the process whether they want you to or not is a pretty effective way of polarizing and finding out if they're into it. You shouldn't do it, but if you're powerful you can probably get away with it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This may partly explain the gendered nature of power as sexy - in gender training women get trained not to enforce their boundaries, and men get trained to enforce them too rigidly and interpret anything as an attack. If you do this to a woman, you might get away with it. If you do this to a man, you might get punched.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This also, perhaps, explains part of why so many men with power end up turning out to be sexual predators - they've essentially learned that violating boundaries will get them sex. My guess is that many of these men didn't &lt;em&gt;start out&lt;/em&gt; rapey, their sense of appropriate behaviour just gradually eroded over time. This doesn't absolve them of responsibility - their actions were still ultimately unethical - but it puts an interesting spin on it. Are we actively training people with power to be ethically worse? If so, what can we do about it? Relying on people with power to be virtuous enough to resist that training doesn't seem like a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today's reading comes from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2VMdTVs"&gt;Random Justice: On Lotteries and Legal Decision-Making&lt;/a&gt;, page 75-76:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;random selection is intended to provide defendants and litigants with the opportunity to be tried by a representative cross-section of the population. The idea here is that fair and democratic social arrangements require that people be accorded the chance to be tried by juries drawn from a cross-sectionally representative pool. That a randomly selected jury will provide the opportunity to be tried by a representative cross-section of the population is, however, by no means guaranteed. [...] a perfectly representative sample is the average ideal of many random samples of a population and is not to be expected in any particular randomly drawn sample - or on any particular petit jury. Perhaps most importantly of all, even if random selection were to yield a jury perfectly representative of the population, the appropriateness of the outcome might still be contested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is actually a really excellent point for tying together a number of my interest areas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In particular it prompts me to think about:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between statistical fairness and individual fairness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What "representative" really means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is representativeness good?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interplay between justice and identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The role of legibility in diversity initiatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As is well known &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/09/towards-a-more-perfect-democracy/"&gt;I'm rather a big fan of random selection&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the reasons for it is the guaranteed proportionality properties of it. However, there are some major distinctive features of juries compared to the situations I've focused on that I'd not previously appreciated until reading this passage just now (despite having read it before!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First off, consider the difficulty of representativeness. Say we've got 12 jurors. Any group whose prevalence in the population is not a multiple of \(\frac{1}{12}\) will not be perfectly represented in the jury - they'll either be over or underrepresented.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a particularly big deal for minority groups. For example, consider Muslims. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom"&gt;Wikipedia tells me&lt;/a&gt; that 4.4% of the UK population are muslim. Therefore the correct number of muslims on a jury of 12 people is 0.528. This is, obviously, hard to achieve.
Random selection achieves this on average by assigning one muslim to the jury 32% of the time, no muslims 59% of the time, and more than one muslim 9% of the time (these numbers are all rounded). That's all very well, but if you're a muslim and you consider it important to have muslims on your jury, it's of small comfort if you're one of the 59% who doesn't get any. Statistical fairness is all very well, but an individual up for trial might quite reasonably expect that it should be fair in their individual case too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This leads further to the question of which groups you want represented.
For example, it might be important to consider ethnicity.
Again, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_British"&gt;according to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, 81.9% of the UK population is white. This means you want 9.83 white people on your jury. Depending on whether you round that to 9 or 10, that gives you 2 or 3 people of colour on your jury. But which racial groups do you want in those 2 or 3? People of colour have certain unifying experiences, certainly (e.g. being on the receiving end of racism), but they're very far from a unified group.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This gets worse when you consider intersections. For example, one can be representative of both ethnicity and gender without being representative of their intersection. Does it matter if all three of your people of colour are men but you make up the gender balance by including more white women? It probably does. Intersectionality tells us that the interplay of racism and sexism is significant in ways that are more than the sum of their parts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's take a step back and ask why this matters. It matters because how we form judgements about people is significantly affected by how legible they are to us, and identity is a big part of this.
I've &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/06/the-ethics-of-false-negatives-in-interviewing/"&gt;previously written about how this affects interviewing&lt;/a&gt;: The heuristics we use for judging people are based on those that are reliable for people who we are familiar with, a group that is generally heavily biased towards people who are like us. These heuristics are not necessarily prejudicial outside that group, but they may be wildly inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This suggests one obvious modification to the principle of representativeness in juries: Where the speaker is part of a minority group, we should aim to err on the side of overrepresentation of that group in the jury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, this is tricky, and risks falling afoul of what Amartya Sen, in his book &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cDC1jV"&gt;Identity and Violence&lt;/a&gt; calls the &lt;em&gt;assumption of singularity&lt;/em&gt; - the idea that we all have a single immutable identity that has primacy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A particularly ironic example of how identity can affect our judgement comes from Miranda Fricker's book, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3cGXfgG"&gt;Epistemic Injustice&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that a hearer responsibly judges a speaker to be untrustworthy (because insincere) owing to the fact that the speaker avoids looking her in the eye, frequently looks askance, and pauses self-consciously in mid-sentence as if to work out his story. The speaker’s behaviour justifies the hearer’s judgement inasmuch as it fits an empirically reliable stereotype of insincerity. In fact, however, this individual is speaking entirely ingenuously, and his shifty manner is simply due to the rather idiosyncratic manifestations of his extraordinary personal shyness. This speaker, let us agree, constitutes an exception to an empirically reliable rule, and thus the testimonial injustice he suffers is caused not by prejudice but simply by bad luck. What should be said about such an example?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we were to consider this shyness example to be an instance of testimonial injustice, then it would be a case of non-culpable testimonial injustice: clearly the hearer has done nothing for which she is blameworthy, either epistemically or ethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What should be said about this example is that somehow Fricker has managed to be either unaware of or indifferent to the existence of people with autism. She has taken a generally (but not wholly! Difficulty with eye contact may also result from e.g. trauma) reliable heuristic on neurotypical people, and declared that because the error is not based on an identity group that she recognises as valid, the error is not culpable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is almost an example of what I've previously described as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-23-09:37.html"&gt;legibility privileges&lt;/a&gt;: The relevant features of identity are ones that are, apparently, illegible to Fricker (autism as a feature identity is perfectly legible, but &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html"&gt;legibility is a relationship&lt;/a&gt;), and so are discounted from consideration.
If you have an autistic muslim woman on trial and the jury selection carefully is carefully padded out with muslim women in order to give her a fair trial but you end up with a jury of 100% neurotypicals (which is highly likely due to the relatively low prevalence of autism) then the selection would potentially be completely missing the point.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As with many seemingly intractable problems, this admits a relatively feasible solution: You have to ask them. People have choice over what aspects of their identity have primacy, and we have a moral duty to respect those choices.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the case of the jury, what seems like a natural solution to me is to start the process of jury selection with a negotiation between the prosecution, the defence, and the judge, about some criteria that the defence would like to ensure is represented in the jury, and then ensure that (say) three out of the twelve jurors satisfy those criteria. Both those three and the other nine would still be randomly selected, but they would be selected from within fixed subsets of the population.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You'd need careful guidelines for how this is to be implemented in practice, and I'm not at all an expert in law or jury selection, so it's likely that I'm missing important features, but I do think some principle like this is worth considering every time you're making a decision about someone - whether it's a jury, as in this example, a hiring panel, or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democracy isn't just voting</title>
    <updated>2020-04-24T12:42:29+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Democracy isn't just voting&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-24&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This post's reading comes from Amartya Sen's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2XYL8aP"&gt;Identity and Violence&lt;/a&gt;", page 55, although actually it mostly comes from Nelson Mandela's "Long Walk to Freedom" (which I haven't read).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his autobiography &lt;em&gt;Long Walk to Freedom&lt;/em&gt;, Nelson Mandela describes how influenced he was, as a young boy, by seeing the democratic nature of the proceedings of the local meetings in his African hometown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone who wanted to speak did so. It was democracy in its purest form. There may have been a hierarchy of importance among the speakers, but everyone was heard, chief and subject, warrior and medicine man, shopkeeper and farmer, landowner and laborer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In context the point that Sen is making is that the idea we have of democracy as a "western" ideal that we've inherited from the greeks and imposed on the rest of the world is bogus, and in fact democracy taken in the general 
as any form of collective decision making that involves its participants equally in the process is found in my cultures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'd like to highlight something else: The democratic ideal that he is describing is actually quite far from the western one, and it's better.
These days in a lot of the west we have this very anemic idea of democracy, where we've basically reduced it to voting,
and voting is in many ways supposed to be the thing you do when better ways of doing democracy have failed.
Reducing democracy to voting is already failure, even before you get into the question of what voting system you should use.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Really the starting point for democracy is not the vote but the discussion (not the debate!) - people getting together to try to figure out the best solution, in a way that respects everyone's needs and viewpoints. Everyone speaks, everyone listens. You don't necessarily have to all agree at the end (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making"&gt;Consensus-building&lt;/a&gt; is sometimes a good idea, but it's hard and not always worth it), but everyone has the option to be heard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't to say that voting is never a good feature in democracy. Voting has a lot of advantages when what you want is a relatively low cost way of deciding between a small number of options, but most decision making isn't like that (and the decision theorists who tell you it is are lying to you). Most of the interesting parts of the democratic process consist of getting to the point where you can reduce things to that small number of decisions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is particularly useful for &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/11/democracy-for-lunch/"&gt;decisions that don't matter very much&lt;/a&gt;, because it lets you get them out of the way quickly, but for more momentous decisions it largely comes at the end when you've exhausted the possibility of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the big limitations of voting over discussion is that it cannot put new things on the table. You can vote for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above#Re-open_Nominations_(RON)"&gt;RON&lt;/a&gt; (the only candidate that can promise change!) in some systems, but most voting in practice does not meaningfully allow that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, I think, suggests a feature that is important and absent from most voting systems: They need to be able to fail. One possible conclusion of voting should be that it concludes that you weren't ready for voting yet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Consensus seeking votes are the easiest example of such a thing: Unless 100% of people agree on an option, the vote fails and you have to go back to discussion. You can do similar things by requiring supermajorities: If \(\frac{2}{3}\) of people approve some outcome, you select that, otherwise back to the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think one reason we overfocus on voting is that it's easier to do at scale (lotteries are also easy to do at scale, but we don't like those for various reasons - some good, some bad). The democratic ideal of discussion really only works with small groups - even our parliaments are too large to really manage it, let alone our populations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I feel like there are probably systems that solve this by essentially patchworking together many small democratic groups, but perhaps the biggest problem with getting there is how little small scale democracy there is in most people's lives. The overwhelming majority of small group interactions we have result in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-15:27.html"&gt;someone basically taking charge&lt;/a&gt;, and because people are increasingly atomized most of us don't seem to be part of any communities that could be or would benefit from being democratically run (maybe this isn't true? It's certainly my impression).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do think one part of that is the absence of good &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/the-missing-social-technology-sector/"&gt;social technology&lt;/a&gt; for this. John Gastil's &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ePnt2m"&gt;Democracy in Small Groups&lt;/a&gt; describes how small group democracy is actually implemented in practice in some of the communities where we do have that, and frankly I'm a democracy fan and I still think it sounds &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe what is needed is something like &lt;a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/"&gt;Liberating Structures&lt;/a&gt;? A toolkit of easy to use small group democratic processes that people can just plug in to their lives and use where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The conditional love of a small town</title>
    <updated>2020-04-25T10:40:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;The conditional love of a small town&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-25&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From bell hooks's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2W0Q9gk"&gt;All About Love&lt;/a&gt;", Page 100:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like living in small towns precisely because they are most often the places in our nation where basic principles underlying a love ethic exist and are the standards by which most people try to live their lives. In the small town where I live (now only some of the time) there is a spirit of neighborliness [...] We protect and nurture our collective well-being. We try to make our home place a positive environment for everyone. We all agree that integrity and care enhance all our lives. We try to live by the principles of a love ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the book she defines love based on the work of Erich Fromm as "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of one's own or another's spiritual growth", which is a definition I quite like (with perhaps mild quibbles about the word "spiritual"), although given how into personal growth I am (it's practically a love language), I would.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So a community that lives by a love ethic is one where everyone is committed to contributing to each other's personal growth.
Such a community is &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; appealing to me, and I often fantasize about finding or creating it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, the idea of finding such a community in a small town? Not just no, but hell no.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing I think this illustrates is how non-transferable experiences of marginalisation are.
bell hooks obviously has more experience of marginalisation than I do - she is a black woman in the US, while I am in most regards a fairly privileged white man. But I am also a queer neurodivergent person, and the experience of small towns for people like me is literally the worst.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're sufficiently "weird" and live or go to school in a small town, chances are pretty good you know almost nobody like you, and it's awful.
In a large city you may still struggle to find people like you, but those people are at least there and once you've found a few you will find more through them. It is possible to build a community of people like you, and to build a love ethic within that community, in a way that I don't think people like me are ever going to really find in a small town.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been reading James C. Scott's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2Kzllyc"&gt;The Art of Not Being Governed&lt;/a&gt;" recently (a book I suspect has never previously been linked to bell hooks's "All About Love"), which is about the hill people of Zomia, a large region of South East Asia, and their relationship to the states. In particular it points out that that rather than being some sort of "living ancestors" of the people of the valley states, the hill people are typically the descendants of refugees who fled the state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things that this has been making me think about is the use of marginalisation as an enabling technology. Many schemes for organising humanity along legible lines work much better if you can just get the people who don't fit to leave. Otherwise you'd have to force them to conform to the system (hard, probably causes rebellions), kill them (same. Also ethics I guess), or adapt the system in order to accommodate the actual richness of human experience (yeah right).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the case of Zomia this is a flight from the large to the small - from the big states to the small isolated communities of the hills - but when it comes to towns there's an equal flight from the small to the large. The people who are weird and don't fit in nope out of the small towns and go find somewhere where they're less constrained. Small communities enforce their own sort of legibility on the people within them, and those who are illegible to them flee to the cities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It may well be that small towns do exhibit the sort of love aesthetic that bell hooks describes, where everyone living in them promotes each other's spiritual growth, but if so they do so by driving out everyone who tries to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;grow in ways that are not approved&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
