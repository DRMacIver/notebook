&lt;p&gt;Another abandoned draft, this one dredged up from an old Google doc.
It was meant to be part of a longer book-length project but I lost
steam, because that’s what happens when I undertake longer book-length
projects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When we use a word, we might know exactly what we mean by it, but
unless other people know what we mean by it our use of it isn’t very
useful. If I wrote a long essay about the strengths and weaknesses of
incorporating scamprooft&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;These are of course all completely made up words.&lt;/span&gt; into our florbnoggle practices, this
would not be very helpful to a reader that doesn’t know what scamprooft
is and hasn’t ever practised florbnoggle in their life.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Of course, such a reader probably won’t benefit from
reading such an essay in most circumstances, but they might if you can
adequately communicate them that florbnoggling is basically the same as
bungipopping, a practice they are quite familiar with, except you zeft
when in bungipopping you would smork.&lt;/span&gt; We
can solve this problem by giving people &lt;em&gt;definitions&lt;/em&gt; of concepts
we are using that they might not be familiar with, in order to help them
understand what we mean by them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A definition, informally, is an explanation of what some concept
(usually labelled with a word or a phrase) means. That is, it tells you
how to apply the concept.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;“Definition” is used in a variety of other related ways.
For example, you can “define the problem”, you can “define the terms of
an agreement” etc. When I talk about definitions in this chapter, I
don’t mean those senses, I mean specifically defining the meaning of
some term.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The key thing that a definition lets you do is understand when some
item fits the concept. This provides you with &lt;em&gt;conditions&lt;/em&gt;
(things you can check) that allow you to tell whether something is an
instance of that concept or not. That is, a definition is supposed to
communicate to you some sort of decision procedure that you can use to
check whether the concept applies in a given instance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Most definitions we use in practice are in some sense incomplete -
there will be some things that the definition gives you a clear yes to,
some that it gives you a clear no to, and a large class of states
(often, but not always, somewhere between the two) where it doesn’t give
you a clear answer. Sometimes that’s a limitation of the definition and
a better definition would decide between them, sometimes it’s just that
the precise boundary is just genuinely fuzzy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some things are just extremely hard to define without
introducing some sort of circularity or non-linguistic explanation. We
explain the colour “red” by pointing to red things until you get the
pattern.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Defining things perfectly is hard to impossible, and often even
undesirable, but some amount of definition is necessary if we’re to be
able to communicate at all. This chapter is about how to use definitions
well, and to do that we’re going to have to dig in to what a definition
actually does, and how to take advantage of definition’s strengths while
compensating for its weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id="necessary-and-sufficient-conditions"&gt;Necessary and sufficient
conditions&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;ideal&lt;/em&gt; of a definition is the sort of definition you
would see in mathematics, which takes some concept and provides strict
necessary and sufficient rules for when it applies. For example: a
square is a shape with four straight sides, all of equal lengths, and
each corner having the same angle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What it means to say that these are &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; conditions is
that if something doesn’t satisfy all of them it is not a square. For
example, an equilateral triangle is a shape with three straight sides,
all of equal lengths, and each corner having the same angle. You can
tell that it’s not a square because it fails the condition of having
four straight sides even though it satisfies all the others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What it means to say that these are &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; conditions is
that if something satisfies all of them it’s definitely a square.
There’s no possibility of saying “Oh whoops I forget that there’s a
secret extra requirement”, these conditions lay out what it means to be
a square and anything that satisfies them is one. We will often write
sufficient conditions as an “if” statement. e.g. “A shape is a square
if…”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To look it another way: A necessary condition is something you can
check in order to show that an item of interest &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; the
thing. A sufficient condition tells you something you can check to show
that an item of interest &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the thing. We will often write
necessary conditions as an “only if” statement. e.g. “A shape is a
square only if…”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Having a set of conditions which is both necessary and sufficient is
very convenient because it gives you a precise&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to have sets of conditions that are necessary but not
sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, you &lt;em&gt;weaken&lt;/em&gt; a set of necessary conditions by
removing parts and they’ll still be necessary, so e.g. “a shape with
four sides of equal lengths” is a condition that is necessary for being
a square (every square has four sides with equal lengths) but not
sufficient because e.g. a rhombus (a square which has been skewed so
that all sides have equal lengths but some corners are pointier than
others) satisfies these but is not a square.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Similarly you can &lt;em&gt;strengthen&lt;/em&gt; a set of sufficient conditions
and still have a set of sufficient conditions. e.g. Anything satisfying
“a shape with four sides of length one and all angles equal” is a
square, but a square with sides of length two does not satisfy these
conditions so they are not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Generally with non-mathematical objects we’re not so lucky as to have
simple necessary and sufficient conditions. Those that are tend to refer
to human-constructed concepts that are built as having necessary and
sufficient conditions deliberately. e.g. legal concepts tend to come
with a very explicit decision procedure for determining that they apply.
You’re “officially married in the country of X”&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Normally one would just say “married” here, but this
blurs multiple related but distinct concepts together, and also elides
historical marriages from before state records begin.&lt;/span&gt; if
you’re officially recorded as married in X or by some country whose
marriages are recognised by X (and if your marriage is of a type that is
recognised by as permissible by X due to e.g. constraints on gender).&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;It’s almost certainly more complicated than this. I am
not a lawyer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For things that are more about describing things that actually exist
in the physical world, what you tend to find is that it’s easy to
provide sufficient conditions and it’s easy to provide necessary
conditions, but there’s a large gap in the middle. e.g. the sorites
paradox (how many grains of sand count as a heap?) can be thought of as
being about this gap: It’s easy to provide a sufficient condition
(e.g. if you’ve got between one and two million grains in a pile, that
counts as a heap), it’s easy to provide a necessary condition (e.g. you
need more than one grain to count as a heap), but somewhere in the
middle the question gets hard to resolve. You’ll have this problem with
most continuous quantities - how tall do you have to be before you count
as tall? How old do you have to be before you count as elderly? There
isn’t a clear boundary, but it’s easy to create necessary conditions and
easy to create sufficient conditions, it’s just not easy to create
conditions that are both.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Running into problems like this is often what stops people coming up
with good definitions for things: They are aiming for a mathematical
style set of necessary-and-sufficient conditions, this doesn’t work, and
then they give up on the whole thing as indefinable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In fact, definitions are perfectly possible for real-world concepts.
We have to give up on them being as nice as mathematical definitions,
but we can still use them to provide people with helpful handles on what
we mean, and it starts by recognising that we’re often going to want to
provide separate necessary conditions and sufficient conditions, and
we’ll almost always have ambiguous edge cases that any definition we
provide won’t cover. This doesn’t stop them being useful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, a necessary condition for being a definition is that it
is an attempt to explain what a term means using language. This is not a
sufficient condition (e.g. talking about the history of the use of a
term satisfies this condition but is not really a definition).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A sufficient condition for something being a definition is that it
has the form “A (term) is a (thing) which…”. This gives you something
very like the mathematical type of definition, and you can sure that
something that looks like this is, or at least can function as, a
definition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Much of the interesting work of defining things lies between the
regions set by these two conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id="ostensive-definition"&gt;Ostensive Definition&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One useful way of defining things is by &lt;em&gt;ostensive
definition,&lt;/em&gt; which means roughly “definition by showing”.
Classically, you point out a bunch of examples and define your term as
meaning “this sort of thing”. When you see it in writing it will often
look like “By this term, I mean things like…”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ostensive definition as defined this way is bad and I don’t like it,
but the thing that it is trying to point to is good, so I’m going to
shamelessly redefine the term (in a way that includes the original
usage) as meaning a definition which uses examples in some essential way
(i.e. not just as illustrations of some point).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The limitation of definition by just pointing at examples is this:
You can think of an example of a concept as being an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt;
specific sufficient condition, and you need at least some sort of
necessary condition preventing you from generalising that condition too
far. “You see this thing? It’s a cat.” gives you a sufficient definition
for being a cat, but it doesn’t tell you what else is a cat. It would be
perfectly reasonable from this one example to assume that cat meant, for
example, animal, and start calling dogs cats as well.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This isn’t pedantry! It’s an actual problem in language
acquisition, both first language and foreign languages.&lt;/span&gt; At
the bare minimum, defining things ostensively requires you to point at
both examples of the concept and non-examples of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In theory, you can define anything you like ostensively as long as
you’re able to interact with the recipient. You give them a bunch of
examples, and then they point at more examples and you say whether they
are or aren’t an instance of the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In practice, most of the time, this doesn’t work very well. Both
because you’re not necessarily getting to interact with the people
you’re defining things for (e.g. if you’re writing it down), and also
it’s very slow because it can take a very long time for them to figure
out the right decision procedure for the concept.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is that people are not necessarily generalising in the
way that you want them to. If you show them a bunch of examples and they
come up with a rule for distinguishing them, there can be many rules
that work.This means that they will consistently have errors in their
understanding of the concept.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Worse, often you won’t even be able to &lt;em&gt;tell&lt;/em&gt; what those
errors are, because either they’re in important but rare edge cases, or
the back-and-forth testing has blind spots because they’re looking for
examples that confirm their theory&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;There’s a classic experiment called the Wason reflection
task which asks you which cards you need to turn over to see if a rule
is satisfied. People very regularly fail to turn over the cards that
they would need to determine that the rule &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; satisfied. For
example, given the rule “if a card shows an even number on one face,
then its opposite face is blue”, you need to turn over red cards and
even cards, but instead people turn over blue cards, which can provide
no information. People don’t tend to show this error in subjects with
which they’re familiar, but they do show it with subjects with which
they’re not, which is exactly the situation you find yourself in when
learning a new concept.&lt;/span&gt;, and you don’t
understand what the examples you need to show their theory is wrong are
because you don’t know what their theory is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can solve, or at least mitigate this, by giving each of your
examples a generalisation - in the case of a positive example (an
example where the concept holds), a sufficient condition that that
example satisfies that makes it an instance of the concept, and in the
case of a negative example (an example where the concept doesn’t hold) a
necessary condition it fails to satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, I’ve given you a couple of examples of definitions, but
I haven’t given you examples of things that &lt;em&gt;aren’t&lt;/em&gt;
definitions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s an easy example of something that isn’t a definition: A cat.
You can tell it’s not a definition because it’s not a use of language,
it’s a cat. A necessary condition for being a definition is that it
involves some degree of use of language (even if it’s just to say “This
is an X” when pointing at an X).&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;“Is a cat an instance of this concept?” is a
surprisingly good starting point in general, because it forces you to
define the boundaries of what sort of thing this concept applies to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s a more interesting example of something that is not a
definition:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priests are identifiable by their consistent attire and groomed
appearance. When not occupied with their official duties, they can be
spotted around town engaged in leisurely activities. They reside in
modest accommodations among the public. Priests dedicate time to
advancing their knowledge and serving the community. They make
themselves available to offer guidance. Though often solitary, priests
derive purpose from their vocation. During infrequent breaks, they
partake in simple enjoyments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;description,&lt;/em&gt; not a definition. It tells you what
priests &lt;em&gt;are like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn9"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn9" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;At least stereotypically. Very few of these things are
universally true of priests of course.&lt;/span&gt;, not what a priest &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;. This
may be useful information about priests and how to spot one, but it
doesn’t tell you anything about what makes someone a priest, or really
even how to tell if they are a priest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using examples like this is an important part of doing ostensive
definition well: If you only pick examples that are far from the
boundary between being instances of the concept and not being instances,
you don’t help people really learn how to make the decision in the cases
where it’s difficult.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another thing that can be helpful is to provide examples where it’s
genuinely ambiguous as to whether it’s an instance of the concept, or at
least it’s not a very good instance. For example, here’s an alternative
paragraph about priests:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priests are people who wear special clothes and live in churches.
They spend a lot of time reading old books and talking to people about
being nice. Priests tell stories to children and sometimes help people
when they are sad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is this a definition? I &lt;em&gt;guess&lt;/em&gt;? It tells you just enough
about what a priest is and what they’re for that I suppose I’d count it
as a definition. But it’s not one I’d be particularly happy with
giving.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sort of ostensive definition is often useful to provide even if
you’re providing a more direct sort of definition, because it greatly
helps the reader understand how the definition works to have examples
and illustrations of how they fit into the definition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id="working-definitions"&gt;Working definitions&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s one small defect with this view of definitions in terms of
necessary and sufficient conditions: It’s wrong. Or, at least, it’s very
limiting - it fails to cover many definitions that exist in practice and
serve a useful functional process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A nice example of this is from Bernard Suits’s book “The
Grasshopper”, which is about philosophy of games. He offers two
definitions of a game. The first is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs
[prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means],
where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less
efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted
just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He then offers the following “portable” definition:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These do not define the same concept - satisfying either of them is
neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for satisfying the
other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you’re going somewhere and you decide to take
the long way around just to add some variety. You discover there’s a
road blocked for maintenance. You could backtrack, but you’re feeling
stubborn, so you instead try to find your way around the road block.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a voluntary (you’re doing it for no other reason that you
feel like it) attempt to overcome an unnecessary (you could always
backtrack) obstacle. It’s not a game in the full sense that Suits
defines it, because it lacks constitutive rules. The thing that is
stopping you from backtracking is not that it would be a rules
violation, it’s that you’re feeling stubborn.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You could argue that there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; constitutive rules that
you’re making up on the fly, but I think that’s cheating and requires
diluting the meaning of “rules” too much.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn10"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn10" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think a better argument would be that Suits is
putting too much emphasis on “rules” and that the things that constitute
a game may not be rules in any sort of formal sense, and any sort of
taking on a restriction to achieve an activity that is constituted by
that restriction is at least somewhat gamelike. Under this view, this
example is a game but not a “Suitsian game” to use Nguyen’s term for
it.&lt;/span&gt;
This is particularly true because I think what happens when you violate
these putative rules is different than what happens if you violate the
rules of a game.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An example from C Thi Nguyen’s account of games is mountain climbing:
There you have the prelusory goal of getting to the top of the mountain,
and a set of constitutive rules about how to do it (you have to climb
the mountain). You could achieve the goal of getting to the top of the
mountain by travelling there in a helicopter. You would still have
achieved the goal, but in violating the rules you are &lt;em&gt;not doing
mountain climbing&lt;/em&gt;. In contrast, in our detour example it’s not that
you’ve failed to do something well-defined. There’s no game of “take the
long way around” that you’re now not playing. It’s just not what you
want to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the other direction, suppose someone threatens to kill you unless
you beat them at chess. Your playing of this game of chess is in no way
voluntary, but you’re still playing a game in the full definition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, in the strictly idealised mathematical sense of definitions as
providing necessary and sufficient conditions, these aren’t the same
definition, they’re barely even related. And yet, it sure seems like
Suits’s portable definition adds something to your understanding of the
meaning of games on top of the full definition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of what it adds is &lt;em&gt;convenience&lt;/em&gt; - the full definition of
games is somewhat unwieldy, and introduces many other terms as part of
its definition. It’s strictly a better definition in terms of giving you
the full concept in detail and making it easier to analyse something in
terms of Suits’s conception of a game, but it’s hard to get much of an
intuitive sense of.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast “a voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles”
is pretty intuitively comprehensible and it is easy to see its gamelike
structure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id="afterword"&gt;Afterword&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that’s where it randomly cuts off. Chalk this one up to another
victim of “things I wish other people understood but that I don’t find
worth the effort of explaining”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Things I believe about ethics and personal development</title>
    <updated>2024-01-15T07:18:28+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Things I believe about ethics and personal development&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-15&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn’t exactly an abandoned draft, in that it’s more or less
complete as it is, but it’s pulled out of an old Google doc and I wanted
it to be somewhere more permanent and visible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is a core to my self-work that I struggle to articulate and
that end up mostly showing up as empty space that I write around. I’d
like to articulate these, with a particular focus on providing clear
statements of belief that are easy for others to disagree with.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Many of these probably require deeper articulation, I am trying to
resist the urge to articulate them. If there is one that you’d like to
discuss, I’m happy to elaborate as much as you need.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By self-work I mean “things that are sort of like therapy”. Anything
that is designed to in some way change your experience of yourself as a
person, your emotional responses, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can, and probably should, change your nature as a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Self-acceptance” in the sense of not constantly beating yourself up
is important and you should do that one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Self-acceptance” in the sense that you’re fine as you are and don’t
need to change is bad for you and bad for others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can get better at things that matter with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things that make you unhappy or hurt others are problems, and you
can likely fix them or work around them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very little of the things that you think of as inherent features of
yourself are actually immutable. If you want to change or compensate for
them you probably can.
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But it’s sometimes going to be a lot of work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And sometimes you’re better off just leaning into them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you do matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People will evaluate you based on your actions and they are right to
do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-work fundamentally needs to start with acting in the
world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to change how you think and feel, but it is more
important to change what you do and change the others in support of
that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By this I mean change &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, not later when you’re done
healing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-work can and should be directed towards becoming a morally
better person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without this, it is doomed to fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempting “ethics-free” self work will likely make you a morally
worse person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the central links between self-work and ethics is your
relationship with guilt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming a morally better person does not usually mean feeling
guiltier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling easily overwhelmed with guilt is in fact a moral
failing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never feeling guilt is also a moral failing.
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Either you’ve suppressed the feeling of guilt, which means you can’t
tell when you’re doing a bad thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or you’re over-scrupulously avoiding doing anything that makes you
feel guilty, in which case you are ineffective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, ethics is fundamentally grounded in self-work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is useless to ask what you should do in the abstract, because the
most important ethical question is “How do I become the sort of person
who does that?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making yourself miserable in the pursuit of ethics probably in the
long run produces worse results than learning how to be happy being a
good person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community building is vitally important for both self-work and
ethical development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-work is fundamentally interpersonal, because being a person is
fundamentally in relationship to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you do not have a community supporting your self-work you will
fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are leading such a community, your self-work needs to at
least be partly directed to being the sort of person who can lead a
community, or your community will fail and it will be your fault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moral realism is clearly fake and distracts from the actual role
of realism in ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethics shape actions and actions have consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ethics shapes relationships and relationships shape people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no objective point of view for ethics. Ethics starts from
subjects and their relationships to others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A core feature of ethics is “alliance building” - I behave this way
because you agree to also behave in a complementary way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But ethics goes beyond alliance building because of the way group
norms shape people. It’s not just about building alliances but about
&lt;em&gt;becoming the sort of person with whom explicit alliances are not
needed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Moral language is in one sense just expressing a personal
preference, but these preferences are not devoid of content, they are
rooted in consequences. e.g. engineering has many ethical judgements
around competence and care that are ultimately rooted in preferences
like “It is bad when bridges fall down”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When we use moral language we are expressing something that is more
than personal but less than fully objective - “X is good (bad)” means
something like “according to the sort of people who I would consider
good, X is (un)desirable, usually based on its outcomes, but sometimes
something intrinsic about it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethics is fundamentally about conflict in the Schelling sense -
the best thing for me is not the best thing for you and vice versa, but
there is an outcome where we cooperate that is better for each of us
than not cooperating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contra Schelling, we change our values each time we cooperate. By
cooperating with you we build trust and love, and I value your wellbeing
more, and vice versa, and this lowers the level of conflict because a
good outcome for the other is also a good outcome for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By repeatedly cooperating we become the sort of people who value
cooperating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also important to value not cooperating with people who don’t
cooperate. Altruistic punishment when someone behaves selfishly is an
important part of this sort of interaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judging people is good and is an important form of altruistic
punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people fall short of their own standards, and it is right and
proper to note that and think less well of them for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should have standards for other people that are at least as
stringent as “Does not fail by their own standards”. e.g. Someone not
treating others as well as you feel they deserve, regardless of whether
they agree with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This judgement does not require an objective morality to be useful
and important. These are judgements by &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; moral
standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These moral standards are how you decide what sort of person to
be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These moral standards are also how you decide what sort of
relationships to have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In many ways those are the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helping people is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I think most people are reasonably altruistic and will feel good if
they help others, and that if this is not the case they probably have
unlearned altruism somewhere along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regardless of whether you are intrinsically altruistic, being in a
community that helps others is selfishly better than being in a
community where people don’t help each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the ways you should help others is to help them live up to
their own standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Punishing people is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When people fall short of your ethical standards, you can and should
make them experience consequences for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default this shouldn’t go much further than expressing
disapproval and maybe downgrading the relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is how you express your preferences for what sort of person to
be in community with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes this will result in breaking the relationship. This is a
failure, possibly a big one, but it is usually better than not having
attempted correction, and often better than many “successes”
(e.g. having to put a huge amount of work into fixing a relatively
unimportant relationship).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For severe ethical failures it can and should go further (call outs,
getting them fired, reporting for crimes, etc. In some cases physical
violence may be appropriate though I’m not personally a fan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Without punishment for transgression of shared norms, communities
die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally punishment goes hand in hand with helping - “I will hold you
to high standards and help you achieve them” but this isn’t always
possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competence is a moral issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s no good having good intentions if you won’t put in the work to
be able to act on them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping people learn to competently act on your shared ethics is one
of the points of communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking responsibility is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad things happen in part because people don’t stop them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are over-focused on &lt;em&gt;not being blamed for bad
things&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People should focus more on &lt;em&gt;not wanting bad things to
happen&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is definitely possible to take too much responsibility but most
people do not take enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This will sometimes result in you being blamed more (because you got
involved and bad things still happen) and being OK with that is one of
the reasons you need to be comfortable with guilt if you are to be more
ethical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A common failure mode of this is feeling responsible for things
going badly without actually doing anything to stop them from going
badly. This is strictly worse than not feeling responsible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about things is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of people in self-work space have had a very disordered
relationship with thinking in the past and so have decided that thinking
is bad. This makes about as much sense as “I was repeatedly punching
myself in the face, so I cut off my hands to stop myself doing that”.
Just stop hitting yourself, idiot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You shouldn’t ignore your feelings when thinking about things
(you’re not doing very good thinking if you are), and you shouldn’t
think to the exclusion of action, but thinking is an essential part of
the acting/feeling/thinking cognitive triangle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done well, thinking is fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part of why people don’t like thinking about things verbally is that
they are conflict averse. If you express your thoughts too clearly then
people can disagree with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rumination is not a central example of thinking, and is an example
of the thinking/feeling part of the triangle going wrong together. You
can often break out of rumination by doing thinking better - e.g. by
writing down your thoughts as clearly as you can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health is heterogenous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a sort of “perfectly spherical idealised human in a vacuum”
generic version of health that a lot of spiritual and therapeutic
practices try to push you towards. This is probably bad for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The healthy versions of two different people will often look very
different from each other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to have a very healthy life that is dominated by
intellectual pursuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is possible to have a very healthy life that is dominated by
physical pursuits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is likely that the optimal healthy life for you involves more of
the generic version of health than you are naturally inclined to
(e.g. more physical activity, more intellectual activity).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health is not mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A healthy life is often something you should be pursuing, but it may
not be achievable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often it will be achievable but you correctly choose not to
prioritise it - it’s too much work, it’s in conflict with other
important things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even if it’s achievable, it may take a long time to achieve.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also the world is better with broken people in it. Many of the most
important changes in modern history have come from people who are
clearly emotionally unhealthy, and who have given their lives to some
overriding obsession and made the world a vastly better place as a
result because e.g. they invented half of the vaccines we use today, or
popularised stainless steel. Maybe any given one of their lives would be
better if they were perfectly emotionally healthy, but their lives would
be worse if the &lt;em&gt;others&lt;/em&gt; were perfectly emotionally healthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Even to the degree that you treat working towards health as
normatively desirable, nobody is there yet, and punishing people for not
being perfectly healthy already is unlikely to achieve the desired
result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing for heterogeneity is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is because people are heterogenous and don’t magically become
homogenous because you don’t approve of that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many people cannot and will not conform to your ideal of how people
should be, and you need to be able to coexist with them without a state
of total war.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally you should be able to form friendships with people who are
very different from you (although not all differences are possible, or
desirable, to form friendships across)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You should certainly be able to support people who are very
different from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exclusive communities are important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communities should be more homogenous than the general population.
It’s important to have communities of people who are in some sense like
you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These communities should have a degree of gate keeping to them,
where people who do not fit the target demographic of the community are,
if not outright excluded, at least expected to expend more effort
fitting in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In particular these communities establish common knowledge within
them, and it is reasonable to expect people who do not share that common
knowledge to acquire it in order to participate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communities also allow people to establish norms that would not work
in the broader world. This can include both stricter norms of good
behaviour, and also weaker norms in which behaviour that would not be
tolerated between strangers is permissible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the functions of such communities is supporting people who
struggle with the broader world. Ideally by helping them navigate it
better, but in extreme cases by sheltering them from it and providing
them an environment in which they can nevertheless contribute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loyalty is important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People adapt norms for low-context low-trust environments to their
private relationships, and this makes them bad people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A prior relationship with someone is in fact a reason to maintain
that relationship and treat it as valuable and give them more leeway and
benefit of the doubt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you’re not prepared to do that, you cannot maintain healthy
relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This does not mean that you should take arbitrary shit from people
you are in relationship with, but it does mean that by being in that
relationship it is reasonable to expect a certain degree of
collaboration in fixing the problems with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a degree of relationship failure past which this is not
reasonable, but that degree has to be pretty severe or chronic before
you break off the relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Because loyalty is important, treating other people’s loyalties as
important is important. Just because you would not form a relationship
with someone does not mean you should punish other people for
maintaining such a relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disagreement and conflict are good and important (disclaimer:
This section is something that I am currently still sorting my shit out
on. I’m not actually good at it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the advantages of a high trust relationship is that it should
be robust enough to support disagreement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One advantage of a low importance relationship is that if the
disagreement breaks it that’s no big deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disagreement clarifies your thinking, and thinking is good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It also is the basis for understanding and improving your shared
norms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we cannot disagree, we cannot find the places where we
agree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disagreement is foundational in being able to orient towards good
together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h1 id="afterword"&gt;Afterword&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This feels unsatisfyingly lacking in an ending that pulls everything
together, but I think that’s part of the point of writing it - I still
haven’t figured out how to pull all of this together. I still think it’s
mostly correct and important though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Journaling as a foundational practice</title>
    <updated>2024-01-16T13:18:15+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Journaling as a foundational practice&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-16&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is another draft bankruptcy, excerpted from another abandoned
book project. Most of the rest of the project is very sketchy but this
is one of the more fleshed out chapters.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Journaling is writing about your life, ideally every day, in a way
that helps you observe key things about it, understand them, and start
to improve them. It returns you to the question of what’s going on in
your life and how you can understand it and improve it over and over
again. It helps you figure out what matters to you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If there is one thing that I wish I had kept up as a practice
throughout the last five years, it’s daily journaling. Every time I’ve
done it it’s been important and transformative and then for one reason
or another I’ve just… stopped.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Editor’s note: Don’t ask how well I’m doing on this
right now please…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Continuity of journaling practice is hard, and the design of the
practice matters both for feeling like you’re getting something out of
it and for making it robust against failure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is what I currently consider an ideal journaling practice:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Journaling is done by hand, with a fountain pen, in an A5 notebook.
For reference, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0B8M88JW9"&gt;I use
this one&lt;/a&gt;, and I think it’s reasonably well designed for the purpose,
but it’s nothing special. Write on some flat surface, with your arm well
supported (note: I am still figuring out ideal writing posture, and may
need to update this advice). Pages in the journal should be dated. I
usually only add a date for the first page of every day (dating every
page is also fine, I just rarely bother). I have a dedicated writing
desk from which phones and computers are banned, but this may be hard to
find space for.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You should have a foundational journaling prompt that you use every
day. The idea of the foundational prompt is that it takes you straight
into just writing without having to make decisions about what to write
about, and it creates a diverse range of different starting points to
get you to examine things from many different angles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mine is this: I draw a tarot card from a standard Rider-Waite-Smith
deck, I consult Joan Bunning’s “Big Book of Tarot” entry for that card.
I read the description of the card out loud. I then write two pages
inspired by it. “Inspired” can be anything that feels right. Often I
pick out some characteristic from the list of characteristics that
describes some problem I’m currently having. Sometimes the card lands
with a big “ouch, too accurate” and I know exactly what to write.
Sometimes the card completely fails to land and I instead describe the
&lt;em&gt;absence&lt;/em&gt; of the card’s qualities from my life. If the card is a
court card I often talk about what it would be like to be the person
represented.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are comfortable with Tarot (this does not require attributing
any mystical significance to it. I don’t), I recommend adopting this as
your specific practice. If you want to try it out without committing to
buying a deck and the book, you can use &lt;a href="https://randomtarotcard.com/"&gt;https://randomtarotcard.com/&lt;/a&gt; for
your card draw and look up the card in &lt;a href="http://www.learntarot.com/cards.htm"&gt;http://www.learntarot.com/cards.htm&lt;/a&gt;
(which is by the same author as the book I use, but the book often has
expanded descriptions).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you’re not comfortable with tarot, I’ll list some alternative
prompts further down.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Note: In actual fact I currently do not my foundational journaling
in my journal, I’m doing it on A4 sheets, because I started it as a
project of working through the deck one card at a time without
replacement and introduced the journal midway through and want to
complete the deck before I switch over to the journal. This section may
be updated if I discover that the switchover doesn’t work, but I have
used a tarot deck this way in the past and expect it to work fine)&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Editor’s note: This project has now been completed. See
&lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/completing-completable-projects"&gt;Completing
completable projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The goal is that the foundational journaling should be done by noon.
If you notice that it is after noon, you should treat it as a matter of
some urgency to go complete it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Immediately after you have done your foundational journaling, you
will ideally write another page of journaling about anything you feel
like writing about. If literally nothing comes to mind, don’t worry
about it. This page is not a requirement of the practice, it’s just a
point at which you are invited to journal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, you should try to journal in whole pages. Keep writing
until the page is full, and then stop. As you notice you’re coming to
the end of a page, try to sum up or fine some appropriate way to drop
the mic at the end.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something else I find useful is to light a candle while journaling.
The way the candle works is that it serves as a sort of anchor: If the
candle is lit, I’m supposed to be journaling. If I notice it is lit, I
should make a decision to go back to journaling or snuff it out. As long
as I’ve completed my foundational journaling, it’s fine to choose to
stop journaling, the candle just serves as a reminder to make the
decision.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Throughout the day if at any point you feel like you need to think
something through or want to express something, go write a page in your
journal about it. The ideal is to cultivate the journal as something you
&lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to use and keep going back to. There is no such thing as
too much journaling as long as most pages you write in your journal feel
productive to have written.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3 id="debugging-notes"&gt;Debugging Notes&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a good opportunity to practise debugging.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Editor’s note: This is partly a reference to a previous
chapter on debugging in this book attempt, but I never actually wrote
that chapter. I may attempt to turn its stub into a notebook post at
some point soon.&lt;/span&gt;
Chances are, if you try to copy the above verbatim, you’ll run into some
problems. I don’t know what they are (if you do run into some problems,
please tell me! I’d like to debug them with you)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I promise that the daily journaling habit is going to be worth it, so
it’s worth spending some time figuring out why it isn’t working for you
and changing that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here are some variants you can try for the physical form:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can, if you must, journal on the computer. I think it’s a bad
idea, but the best system is the one you can actually follow, so if you
hate handwriting and can’t bring yourself to do it, don’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can reduce the volume of journaling, either by writing fewer
pages, switching to a smaller journal, allowing yourself to stop at the
half page mark, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could journal on disposable paper - write it on an A4 sheet and
then shred it if you don’t want to keep it around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiment with different pens and journals. Do you hate fountain
pens? Do you prefer squared over lined? etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For the content you could try different foundational practices.
e.g.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick some book of special significance to you (a bible for example,
but it could also be a favourite novel) and use that as a source of
prompts. Turn to a random page, read the page out loud, and focus in on
some passage that feels salient in some way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than having a special book, you could have a book that you
rotate. Pick some book of your shelves, use that for a while. When you
feel like moving on after journaling, switch it out for something
else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A variation on the above is that rather than random pages you could
work through the book sequentially - read a few pages before journaling
until you find something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core of the foundational practice is that it needs a random
prompt to get you started, and those random prompts have to have a
reasonable amount of range, and a lot of flexibility for interpreting
them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another common way the journaling practice is likely to fail is that
you just stop doing it. Usually you forget to do it one day, and it
makes it easier to forget to do it the next, etc. The practice I
described above has a number of features designed to offset that:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has a specific centre that is easy to return to (do your
foundational journaling before noon).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It makes that centre easy to achieve (it uses a random prompt)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has the candle as an anchor to help stabilise the practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similarly it has a physical book for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But these are all predicated on the fact that it’s relatively easy
for me to find time in the morning to do it, and I have a good physical
space for it. Your problems might be different.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core thing to do though is to decide:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When are you going to do your journaling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you going to do when you miss that slot?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are you going to do your journaling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are you going to do if you’re not able to do it there? (e.g.
because traveling)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For me the answers are:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideally while I drink my morning coffee, but any time before noon is
fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as I can after noon I go do my journaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At my writing desk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I’ll bring my journal with me and try to do some journaling on the
right schedule, but it often won’t be my foundational practice because I
don’t have the tarot deck I’m using with me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h3 id="afterword"&gt;Afterword&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This excerpt was a good reminder that I should try to journal more
reliably again. I haven’t stopped doing it, but I probably average about
once a week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Partly this is because this daily writing project is taking up the
time slot that would otherwise be used for journalling.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cheeseburger Ethics</title>

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Cheeseburger Ethics&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-17&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another draft-amnesty post extracting a usable excerpt from an
attempted book length project, though lightly edited from the version in
draft. Originally based on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1557717189159010304"&gt;a
Twitter thread of mine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An important tool of ethical reasoning I use is the &lt;em&gt;cheeseburger
threshold&lt;/em&gt;: Asking whether an act is ethically better or worse than
eating a cheeseburger.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is useful because some bad things we do are bad like murder, and
some are bad like eating cheeseburgers, and the standards we hold those
different types of act to should be very different.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is not unlike the classic distinction between a
venial and a mortal sin, but I like making the distinction this way
better, both for the examples and because I’m not that interested in
whether your action counts as turning away from god.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The key distinguish factor is that something is murder-bad if the
ethically correct amount to do of it is zero, while it is
cheeseburger-bad if some amount of it is morally permissible and
incremental reductions are morally virtuous even if they don’t - and
aren’t intended to - get you to zero.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;There are of coure strict vegetarians who would hold
that eating a cheeseburger is as bad as murder, but even most
vegetarians who believe that the correct amount of cheeseburgers to eat
is zero will generally treat it as being in a different reference class
to murder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why cheeseburger-bad?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are clearly negative consequences to eating a cheeseburger -
the meat industry has many ethical problems, and even the most ethically
produced cheeseburger in which everyone in the pipeline was well paid,
all the animals were well treated, etc. has significant environmental
costs. Probably even if not vegetarian one should assign some ethical
significance to the life of the cows killed in making the cheeseburger
(both for the meat and for the cheese), and that too should be factored
in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But also cheeseburgers are convenient and delicious and widely
culturally accepted as permissible to eat and so, despite the harms, we
eat cheeseburgers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Possibly you’re vegetarian, or vegan, or hindu, or keep kosher. In
which case I encourage you to substitute your own similar badness act
for the cheeseburger. I like the cheeseburger example because the harms
are so clear - as much as we like to ignore them - and eating it is so
clearly culturally permitted. But you could consider, for example,
driving a car as another cheeseburger style act (environmental cost,
noise pollution, risk of injury to others, etc).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another cheeseburger-bad act might be pirating movies or TV shows.
It’s on its own a “victimless” crime if you wouldn’t otherwise have
bought the thing pirated (of course, it’s easy to convince yourself of
that. Would you really not have?). Certainly the harms of pirating a
digital good are relatively minor. And yet, in aggregate, piracy does
seem to cause a lot of harms, especially to independent authors,
publishers, and developers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I will continue to be using cheeseburgers as my example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The point is that cheeseburger-bad acts are things that we
acknowledge have harms, and that a maximally virtuous version of
yourself might choose to avoid cheeseburgers entirely. The current
version of you could, and possibly should, also choose to eat fewer
cheeseburgers, and we would acknowledge this as morally virtuous,
without requiring that you cut out on cheeseburgers entirely for it to
count.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the ethically correct amount of murder is zero. You do
not get points for saying “Yeah, I know murder is bad, I’m trying to cut
down”. Murder is bad enough that by the time “I’m trying to cut down” is
a consideration, you are already beyond the ethical pale.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although I’ve phrased it as a threshold for how bad an act is, using
this tool more a question of how (if at all) you can reform from
performing such an act.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think this may be a sign that I’m framing this wrong
tbh. “Is it as bad as eating a cheeseburger?” is a useful framing
question, but really what I’m talking about is something more like
categories of ethical acts. Commensurability of acts is part of it but
not all of it.&lt;/span&gt; A habitual murderer doesn’t need to
cut down, they need to change their very way of being. A habitual
cheeseburger-eater just needs to cut down.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is again a subject on which many vegetarians would
differ because they would in fact regard cheeseburger-eating as
requiring a fundamental reform of your character. I suggest again
replacing this with another example.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think it’s very hard for sufficiently many cheeseburger-bad acts to
add up to murder-bad. Someone who eats cheeseburgers for breakfast,
lunch, and dinner, is rude to everyone he meets, drives loud gas
guzzling cars everywhere, and generally goes out of his way to do every
pettily immoral and inconsiderate act he can think of is still not doing
something murder-bad. The correct approach here is still to cut down,
and every step along the way to doing so is morally praiseworthy.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Although they may be enough of a jerk that you don’t
want to praise them. You can think of this instead as being
incrementally less morally blameworthy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, say, running a scam is murder-bad despite not being
nearly as bad as murder - you can’t think of reform from this as trying
to cut down on the scams you run, you need to become a person who does
not run scams.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why make this distinction?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The main reason is because it’s important to be able to acknowledge
that some things we do are bad without it being a big deal. Having a
class of actions which we acknowledge are bad but don’t consider
ourselves morally obliged to eliminate entirely allows us to make
incremental improvements, which has good effects. If we treated all
cheeseburger-bad things as murder-bad, this creates a very strong
incentive against recognising them as bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The cheeseburger example works very well here: Even from a strict
vegetarian’s point of view, it should be considered preferable for 100%
of people to cut out 90% of their meat consumption than for 50% of
people to go full vegetarian. Also, most people aren’t and are not going
to become vegetarian, and being able to view their actions as worth
reducing without having to&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Being able to acknowledge the harms of our own behaviour without
being overwhelmed with guilt allows us to take a proper reflective look
at our own behaviour and, where we decide it’s worth it, improve it, and
where we decide that’s too much work, helps put it in perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Something isn’t working</title>
    <updated>2024-01-18T10:24:43+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Something isn’t working&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-18&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Loosely based on a stub chapter from the same work as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-16-13:11.html"&gt;Journaling
as a foundational practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core of my approach to a lot of things is embarrassingly simple:
If you’re getting outcomes you don’t like, that means something about
what you’re doing isn’t working, and you can fix that. A system is
perfectly designed to achieve the outcomes it achieves, so if you don’t
like the outcomes you have to change the system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is in direct contrast to &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/dont-just-try-harder"&gt;doubling
down on the thing you’re doing&lt;/a&gt; because if it isn’t working then
clearly the solution is to try harder, or to get mad about the fact that
it doesn’t work and conclude it must be some failure of yours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a running joke that when I do coaching, a great deal of the
value I add is to listen patiently and then say “Yes, that does sound
like a problem. Have you tried solving it?”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I very rarely literally say this, but I do often say variants of
this. “What have you tried?” is a common one. Often the answer is that
they’ve not tried anything. Sometimes they have tried many things, but
they haven’t worked.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“They” of course also often means “me”. Sometimes I need someone to
say “Have you tried solving the problem?” to me too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My approach to writing software isn’t that much different. I write
software. It’s software, so it has problems. I fix those problems. &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/03/what-the-fuck-are-we-doing/"&gt;Sometimes
I probably shouldn’t&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately this approach has produced very
good results that would otherwise seem impossible, just by fixing the
problem in front of me repeatedly and seeing what happens.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Fixing things that aren’t working consists of trying to understand
them, based on that understanding trying to change something that you
think will help, and learning from what happens then - either its
success or its failure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ultimately this is a process of &lt;em&gt;debugging&lt;/em&gt;, and it feels very
much like debugging software, where you systematically narrow down what
causes a problem until it’s clear enough to fix.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Software and other &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/two-types-of-work"&gt;crunchy
work&lt;/a&gt; is very good for teaching this skill, because it provides you
with a very tight feedback loop that rewards systematically going
through everything. It’s a good type of work for learning &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-07-08:50.html"&gt;how to
be better at everything&lt;/a&gt; because of how much it rewards diligence.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is interesting contrast to my advice not to just
try harder, but I think they’re compatible. The unified advice is that
if you’re going to put in more work, don’t put it in by doing more of
the thing you’re currently doing, do it on things that you’re not doing
because they seem like too much work.&lt;/span&gt; A lot of these skills then transfer
reasonably well to other environments, as long as you’re prepared to
understand how crunchy work and squishy work differ. Nobody likes a
software developer who treats everything like a software problem, but
part of why that type is so common is that the basic attitude
&lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;. Treat things as understandable, and fixable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For me in particular I use “debugging” as a concept a lot in
emotional contexts. e.g. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-20-17:58.html"&gt;How I
fix anxiety triggers&lt;/a&gt; is very much a debugging process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the most important things to debug is when you get &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-give-good-advice"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt;
from other people and it doesn’t work for you. It might be that you’re
doing it wrong, but it might also be that the advice is not well suited
for you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1656631345165000704"&gt;said
before&lt;/a&gt; that the universal disclaimer of self-help books is “This
advice has a domain of applicability, and the author is not competent to
assess what it is”. i.e. This will help some people, but the author
doesn’t actually know who. This applies to all advice, really.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some (non-exhaustive) ways advice can fail to apply to you:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is some ideal middle ground, and this advice is designed for
people on the far side of that from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This advice relies on capabilities you lack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This advice solves something that’s not your bottleneck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But from a debugging point of view, this makes such advice actually
quite useful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a book called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Measure-Anything-Intangibles-Business/dp/1118539273"&gt;How
to measure anything&lt;/a&gt; that I am mostly&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think that there is a target audience for whom it is
very good, and I am not that target audience.&lt;/span&gt;
indifferent to, but that had a fundamental premise that has entirely
justified the read for me: A measurement is anything that reduces
uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this sense, everything you try while debugging is a measurement.
Either it solves the problem, in which case you’ve solved the problem
and also learned something, or it doesn’t and you’ve learned something
through how it fails. Use that measurement to find out more about the
problem. Everything you try is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-26-09:43.html"&gt;a
forking path&lt;/a&gt; that tells you something about the system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So here is my advice: Try more things, take more advice, but notice
as you do when something isn’t working, and then fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shared frustrations</title>
    <updated>2024-01-20T12:00:45+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Shared frustrations&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-20&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am, it will shock you to know, annoyingly finickity about things
being done correctly. It hurts me somewhere deep in my soul when people
do things in obviously suboptimal ways.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Importantly I’m fine with people doing things less well
because it’s easier. What annoys me is when people are obviously failing
&lt;em&gt;by their own standards&lt;/em&gt;, getting worse outcomes for a worse
experience of doing the thing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I try to reign this in. I don’t actually like telling people off, so
I’ll often be silently frustrated rather than telling someone about
it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is a bad idea for anything recurring, because as a
result I sound super annoyed by minor things when I finally break and do
say something about it. I’m not saying I don’t do that, I’m just saying
I do that and I know it’s a bad idea. If you will, an obviously
suboptimal approach that is failing even by my own standards…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you two instances of this recently and something
interesting I learned from them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is this: We have an instant pot. Its pressure cooking mode
gets used for roughly two categoires of things: Making stock (usually
beef, sometimes chicken), and what you might think of as “normal
cooking” - stews, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Crucially, these take very different times. Stock takes about four
hours, normal cooking takes somewhere between 20 and 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Adjusting the time on an instant pot is very slow. This makes
switching between these two times irritating. Fortunately, the instant
pot has a feature for this: The pressure cooker remembers two previous
times, and you can press the pressure cook button to switch between
them. So you can have it remember a four hour time and a half hour time,
and everything is fine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At least, everything is fine if people use this feature and don’t set
both timers to four hours, forcing me to do the slow adjustment process
every time I used the normal cooking mode. Very annoying.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I did eventually explain this feature to the others in my house, and
of course neither of them knew about this feature - it’s not like they
would have been maliciously setting the timer wrong, and it’s a pretty
non obvious feature until you know about it, and I only found out about
it relatively recently. Problem solved. But I’d been vaguely annoyed
every time I used the instant pot for the entire several month period
between discovering this feature and telling people about it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;To be clear I don’t use the instant pot &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;
often, so we’re talking about maybe 3 or 4 times at most.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More on this in a moment, but now let me tell you about another
kitchen irritation: Someone has been stacking the pots wrong. This means
that the cupboard doesn’t close properly because the pot stack is too
tall.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a specific stacking order to the pots. If you get it right,
the pot stack is short enough for everything to work fine. If you get it
wrong, they don’t nest and it’s too tall. Someone had been placing pots
in a non-nesting order, and this was causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Eventually we were in the kitchen together at the time when the pots
needed stacking, and I showed them how to do it. “Oh, that’s how you
stack them! I had no idea those nested, they look exactly the same size.
That’s been so annoying.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are two interesting things about this response:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They were in fact correct, it was slightly non-obvious. The pots are
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exactly the same size, but they do look pretty similar from
the outside, it’s just that one has much thinner metal than the other so
although they look similar in size the slightly smaller one nests easily
in the slightly larger one, because the interior of the slightly larger
one is much larger relative to the slightly smaller one than their
exterior would suggest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’d been annoyed by this too, and I hadn’t shown them how to
solve their annoying problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This recontextualised some things for me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That instant pot thing? Adjusting the timer to four hours from half
an hour is just as annoying as adjusting the timer from four hours to
half an hour. I shared it as a “this is a thing you do that is annoying
to me and here is how to not do it” but in actual fact it was probably a
thing we &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; were finding frustrating, and that I could easily
have shared as “Hey you know that annoying thing? I’ve figured out the
solution!”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing about being annoyingly finickity is that because I care
about doing things right, and because I &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-18-10:00.html"&gt;debug
everything so reflexively&lt;/a&gt; is that “obviously suboptimal ways” is not
actually obvious to others. It’s obvious to me because I’ve &lt;em&gt;figured
it out&lt;/em&gt;. Sometimes through careful problem solving and sometimes
because I accidentally pressed the button twice and noticed what
happened when I did.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I’ve done that, I can share this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The silly thing is that I’m actually very good at sharing knowledge a
lot of the time. I have a sort of habitual attitude of teaching when
people ask me for help. e.g. a great habit of mine that you should
definitely steal is that when people can’t find a link and I find it
using search, I give them both the link and also tell them how I found
it. This is a great way of helping people be better at search, which is
a surprisingly deep and hard to learn skill.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;The downside of this habit is that it sounds a bit too
“let me google that for you” if you’re not careful. I usually &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/telegraph-your-moves"&gt;telegraph&lt;/a&gt;
why I’m doing this quite carefully, and am very explicit that it’s not a
problem if they apologise for not googling for it themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I’m good at sharing information spontaneously - you’re
reading this on one of my outlets for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But volunteering information to someone specific, in response to
something that they’re doing wrong, feels different. Like I said, it
feels like telling them off, and I don’t like doing that. It feels bad
for me to do it, and I’m worried about people reacting badly to it. Most
people don’t like unsolicited advice. Not that I expect anything to go
terribly wrong from telling partners about minor things, but it might
hurt their feelings and I don’t actually like doing that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do think this fear is somewhat real - a lot of the time people
don’t like being told they’re doing it wrong, and often wrong is
subjective. Sometimes &lt;em&gt;I’m&lt;/em&gt; wrong because the suboptimal way is
in fact optimising for some preference I don’t know about. I suspect
it’s exaggerated in my head, but it is a real possibility.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I think a lot of the time, the fear is largely the result of a
skill issue on my part, and I need to stop thinking in terms of “argh
you’re doing it wrong” and more “boy it looks annoying to do it that
way. Can I show you a thing?” and see how people respond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developing new capacities</title>
    <updated>2024-01-20T12:44:36+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Developing new capacities&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-20&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a general phenomenon that I think of as “capacities” - your
ability to do things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A capacity can be anything. It can be a broad skill, it can be a
narrow trick that you know how to solve some particular problem with. It
can be a physical item. It can be someone you know who you can do the
thing for you. It can be some complex emergent combination of all of
these thigns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A capacity is not just that you can or can’t do the thing. It’s
&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you do the thing, and a crucial part is how easy it is for
you to do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A good illustration of this for me is cars. I’ve owned a car, for the
first time in my life, for a bit over a year. Previously, whenever I
needed a car I rented one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From a financial perspective, I’d probably still have spent less
money on my car if every time I used it over the last year I rented a
car instead. We’re getting to a point where it might be close, but I
think I’d still have spent about 50% less money.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In actual fact I’d have spent a lot less than that of course, because
most of the times I’ve used the car over that year I just wouldn’t have
bothered. It’s not just about the financial cost, it’s about the fact
that my car is literally right there and I can just get in and drive.
Renting a car adds a significant effort overhead that makes small
transactions not worth it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Yes, I’m aware of Zipcar and the like. In my experience
they’re exactly optimised for use cases I don’t have, and end up
strictly worse for almost anything I care about.&lt;/span&gt; In theory, owning the
car doesn’t make me able to do anything that renting a car wouldn’t, but
in practice the different effort levels involved make it a very
qualitatively different capacity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, as well as the cost and convenience, having the ability to
casually drive means I get better at driving because I do it more
regularly. This makes driving less stressful, so I’m more willing to do
it. Having the capacity teaches you to use the capacity, and thereby
enlarges it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I did know this prior to owning a car, but I probably still
undervalued it. The main thing I bought a car for was to be able to
drive to and from my parents’ house - it’s about an hour’s drive from me
by car, and essentially has no public transport options to get there in
under three hours.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;In actual fact, I would probably still just about be
ahead on cost if I’d taken a taxi to and from my parents’ every time
I’ve visited them since buying this car. It would come to maybe £200 for
the round trip, and I’ve probably visited them maybe 20 times since
then, which is only £4,000. But also many of the trips would not have
happened at this price tag - it’s easy to pop around for dinner on a
whim with a car, but that wouldn’t happen with a £200 price tag and the
need for advance planning that comes with a taxi.&lt;/span&gt; It was very much a response to a
particular problem I had.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But once you have a car, you can just use it for easy things. I use
it for shopping from time to time, I use it for moving big things. I can
bring a giant stack of firewood back from my parents’ place if I want,
which a taxi would side eye me on. I can pop over to the next town
easily.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I probably still underutilise the car to be honest. Part of this is
that I feel at some level I shouldn’t be driving too much (I think this
is true but that I’m probably overstating it). Part of this is just that
I’m still used to a mindset that I’ve had for most of my life, where I
don’t own a car and can’t do car things as a result.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This seems like something I should fix. The car is useful, and
expensive to maintain, so I might as well figure out how to make use of
it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a much more &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/why-is-it-hard-to-choose-what-to"&gt;proactive
mode&lt;/a&gt; than I often remember to deploy. I’m all about “That does seem
like a problem. Have you tried solving it?” but this is much more “That
does seem like a solution. Have you tried finding problems to solve with
it?”. It’s worth doing, I just don’t habitually do that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Importantly: I don’t know that I could have done it nearly so well
without owning a car and starting to recontextualise how useful they
are. Once you have the capacity and you figure out how to use it well,
you unlock a lot of hidden value that just thinking in terms of what
problems you already have that could be solved with it, because it
doesn’t just solve existing problems for you, it opens up things that
you don’t even think of as problems because it doesn’t occur to you that
you can do them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I’ve been thinking about this recently is that my income
has gone up a lot over the last year, and money is very much a capacity,
and I’ve been trying to figure out ways to deploy that capacity for life
improvement recently. It’s going pretty well. There are fairly modest
low hanging fruits available that you just don’t think about when money
is tight, and aren’t even that expensive once it’s loosened up a bit.
For example I paid for an ironing service recently, because I like
wearing collared shirts&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Although I haven’t actually started wearing them again
yet. Lost the habit and I’ve been busy.&lt;/span&gt; but hate ironing. It cost about £20
to get literally every shirt I own ironed. Not free by any means, but
very affordable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another capacity I’ve been working on that flows out of this recently
is that I realised that my household would very much benefit from some
additional help with admin, so we’ve hired a part-time PA&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;How did I find a PA? I posted on the local Facebook
group asking if anyone was available for such work. Another thing I
recently discovered existed, and thereby developed a capacity I
previously lacked.&lt;/span&gt; on
an experimental basis. We’ll basically give her odd jobs and pay her
weekly at a rate of £15/hour for however much work she’s done during
that week. This is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; early days experiment, so there
are loads of things that may or may not work about it, but I’m very
happy to have done it nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about this decision is that I don’t
really know what sort of tasks we’ll give her. The specific prompt was I
wanted someone to offload a search for a good cleaner to, but that’s
totally something I could do myself&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And has been totally something I could do myself for
months…&lt;/span&gt;. We’ve got a bunch of
other small tasks like that, but there’s a very real possibility that
we’ll just work through a TODO list and then by done.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I don’t think so. I think having someone like this to offload
tasks to is going to be a really good capacity to have, and I’m looking
forward to finding out ways to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drawing on resources</title>
    <updated>2024-01-21T10:24:34-08:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Drawing on resources&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-21&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Complementary to the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-20-12:01.html"&gt;capacities&lt;/a&gt;
view of things, another useful broad label is “resources”. Resources are
essentially anything you can draw on to do stuff. Possibly, though not
necessarily, in a consumable way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s some overlap between the two concepts of course, in that
every resource implies a capacity of stuff you can do by drawing on that
resource. e.g. I talked about money as a capacity, and money is
obviously also a resource.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the places I find this view most useful is creativity in
general, and writing in particular. When you are writing, you have
essentially all of your existing pool of experiences and knowledge as a
resource to draw on. All of the e.g. conversations you’ve had, books
you’ve read, idle thoughts you’ve had, things you’ve done, previous
material you’ve written, sit together in your head as a kind of pool of
inadequately articulated material that you can pull on and refine out
into something that you write about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of the view that creativity isn’t really something you
generate, but is instead a (skilled and difficult!) exploration of the
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-things-come-to-be-as-they-are"&gt;adjacent
possible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The resources available to you define your adjacent
possible because you draw on them to elaborate and combine them into new
material.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing that seems to be common with creative resources is that
they become stale. You see this with some authors who, for example, draw
on their professional experience and produce really good work, but the
more they become writers and the further divorced they are from that
professional experience, the more shallow their writing becomes. I liked
Lethain’s &lt;a href="https://lethain.com/writers-who-operate"&gt;writers who
operate&lt;/a&gt; as an expression of this problem. This was definitely part
of my concern with my consulting business too - I was a bit too far
removed from the professional experiences I was drawing on, and as a
result I’m appreciating going back into more senior IC level work. It
definitely feels like I have a much richer set of renewing experiences
to draw on now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You also see this thing in fiction. For example, hypothetically, you
might have a science fiction writer who is clearly drawing on his
experience as a software developer who has dealt with a lot of office
bullshit, but the longer he’s a science fiction writer the less relevant
any of that experience becomes. Hypothetically.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This also came up during the pandemic I think. I don’t know if you
noticed, but it feels like a lot of material that was written in
2020-2021 is a bit… flat. As if the day to day experience people were
drawing on as stimulus for their writing was no longer there. I might be
imagining this - it’s certainly at least partly a reflection of
&lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; mood during those times as anyone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One general strategy that I think is worth doing is to seek out
activities that cause you to generate new resources. For example, it’s
good to have regular conversations with people about the sorts of things
you might like to write about.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;A non-trivial number of my posts in general are sparked
by conversations on discord.&lt;/span&gt; I also use &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-16-13:11.html"&gt;journaling&lt;/a&gt;
as a place to generate half formed thoughts for drawing on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Landmarks</title>
    <updated>2024-01-22T08:10:54-08:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Landmarks&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-22&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of why I like solving problems so much is that they
serve as landmarks in the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you’ve got a problem you don’t know how to solve, then solving it
necessarily involves learning something new.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That’s not a deep insight. It’s just what “don’t know how to solve”
means.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But the flipside of this is that the fact that you have the problem
means that you know something about that discovery: It has to solve the
problem, and you do understand the problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Discovery is about walking up to the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-26-09:00.html"&gt;edge
of the familiar&lt;/a&gt; and stepping over.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You start from where you are, and then you go to something new.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Normally, this is bewildering. You step out of familiar territory and
are in a bewildering landscape with a million directions you can go in,
and no clear way to choose between them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After all, if you knew where you were going then it wouldn’t be
unfamiliar territory.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But when you have a problem to solve, it gives you a clear sense of
direction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s as if you can see the shape of the solution towering in the
distance, telling you which to go: This way. Towards me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can evaluate your unfamiliar discoveries against your problem -
do they solve it? Do they help understand it? Do they at least do
something interesting with it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem does not, exactly, tell you which way to go. There will
be dead ends, there will be detours. The landscape of the unfamiliar is
mysterious and hard to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But you can tell if you’re getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People aren’t for any one simple thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But one of the things I’ve always known I am for is expanding the
boundaries of human understanding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’d like it to be in large ways. I certainly haven’t managed this
yet, but I have managed many small ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m not exactly content with that, but I am pleased that I have.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But one of the difficulties is knowing where to start, what to
do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The unfamiliar is vast, and “expand the boundaries of human
knowledge” isn’t exactly a clear mandate. How can you possibly pick a
direction? I don’t know where to start.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I of course know the answer, even if I haven’t always been good at
executing on it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because there’s a little voice in my head that when it hears the
question, answers thus:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes, that does sound like a problem, David. Have you tried solving
it?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I don’t wanna</title>
    <updated>2024-01-23T06:57:00-08:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;I don’t wanna&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2024-01-23&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a particular feeling that I think of as the “I don’t wanna”
feeling. It’s a kind of sluggish resentment, of the sort you get when
someone asks you to do something when you’re tired, or ill, or
hungover.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s the sort of feeling where &lt;a href="https://the-toast.net/2014/02/13/woman-has-to-do-the-same-shit-tomorrow/"&gt;Woman
Amazed And Horrified She Has To Just Keep Getting Up And Doing The Same
Shit Again Tomorrow&lt;/a&gt; starts to become extremely relatable:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t an actual problem,” this woman tried to tell herself.
“The fact that I have to…do things to exist, that isn’t an actual
problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Which, oh God,” she realized, “means there’s no actual
solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I definitely find the frequency with which this feeling comes is a
depression sign. Feeling like this regularly and about regular things is
absolutely not a sign that you’re in a healthy emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I think it’s interesting to note the places that it comes up even
when I’m &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; especially depressed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, it’s often the specific feeling underlying &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-cant-solve-procrastination"&gt;procrastination&lt;/a&gt;
for me. Especially on certain classes of task. e.g. I hate cleaning my
room. I’m aware this is childish.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And probably if I dig deep there’s some &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/parts-of-you-havent-grown-up-yet-004"&gt;child
part&lt;/a&gt; expressing some specificoutrage there&lt;/span&gt;. That’s often how “I
don’t wanna” feels.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But another more interesting place it comes up is tasks for which it
feels like this way &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;. Writer’s block is a very “I
don’t wanna” feeling for example.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I leave it as an exercise to the interested reader to
infer why I picked this particular topic to write about today.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s often possible to work past this particular instance of “I don’t
wanna” with a sort of gentle self-coaxing, but it tends to be a bit like
pulling teeth, with every step along the way requiring a constant level
of coaxing. “You don’t have to do very much, just write a short piece”
or “If you can’t think of anything, why not use this prompt…?”. These
strategies work as long as I &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/believing-that-you-can-stop"&gt;believe
that you can stop&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Of course to a degree that promise is to some degree
fake. e.g. I really am going to write a notebook post every day
regardless of how I feel about it, and I’m not going to abandon a post
literally midway through, though I might cut it short.&lt;/span&gt; sometimes, but there’s a sort of low
bubbling resentment at being made to do the thing throughout the entire
experience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about the feeling of “I don’t wanna” is
that it very much comes with a feeling that the thing being requested is
&lt;em&gt;too hard&lt;/em&gt;, but this is clearly fake. You can tell it’s fake
because the internal response to making the thing easier is a sort of
“Fuck you”, and because a great deal more effort than the thing itself
would take is spent resisting it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Again, leading credence to the idea that it’s some sort
of child part.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think a more accurate reading of this “it’s too hard” feeling is “I
don’t wanna do the thing, so I’m going to &lt;em&gt;make sure&lt;/em&gt; that it’s
too hard to be worth it”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The feeling is also sortof recursively resistant to introspection.
The feeling that comes up when I try to introspect an “I don’t wanna” is
an “I don’t wanna!!”.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I probably don’t need to keep pointing out how extremely
literally this seems like interacting with a child.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things that’s interesting is how often the “I don’t wanna”
isn’t exactly wrong and is more of an “I’m not ready”. There have been
enough instances of having this sort of feeling on something - writing a
thing, fixing a bug, etc. where all I needed to do was sleep on it and
the next day was able to easily and fluently work on it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, in the other direction waiting for the next day is
often actively unhelpful, because it can let the I don’t wanna feeling
really take hold and a long period of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html"&gt;drifting&lt;/a&gt;
can easily begin. That’s the sort of time when an I don’t wanna feeling
is secretly depression. I don’t think my model of depression as a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-19-10:53.html"&gt;consistent
bias towards inaction&lt;/a&gt; is the whole of the picture&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Especially because depression is multifaceted and this
is only one type of depression I’m talking about.&lt;/span&gt;,
but it does seem to keep rearing its head.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One place this feeling really comes up, no matter how depressed or
not I am at the moment, is anything that feels like it’s trying to
“force” creativity. If I’m in a creative mood, being creative is easy,
but it’s not like I stop being able to be creative when I’m not in the
mood - I understand creativity well enough that I have systems that
would absolutely let me do it if I could bring myself to use them when
blocked, but unfortunately most of the time I very much don’t wanna.&lt;/p&gt;
