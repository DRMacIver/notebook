&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Habit Overload&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Attention Conservation Notice: Personal debugging. May be of interest if you have similar problems, which you probably do, but I've not made any particular effort to generalise it into a coherent point.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been noticing recently that a lot of my recurring habits have been slipping,
so I'm attempting to take stock of this and try to figure out what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the problem has a couple of roots:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm trying to do too much. There's plenty of time to do all the habits if I do nothing else, and even if I do a reasonable amount of work on my PhD, but the reality is that I don't do a reasonable amount of work on my PhD because my two modes are "not really doing enough work on it" and "total all consuming obsession", and the latter tends to impinge on the habits and make me feel bad about neglecting them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the habits probably weren't working that well for me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the habits have lost cues that were previously helpful for keeping on top of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My planning system became lightly aversive because it was trying to keep me on track despite the above fighting against me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this can mostly be solved by taking stock a bit of what's reasonable, and deciding what habits to drop and what to keep, and part of that is looking at what's not working and dropping or modifying it based on where it fits into the above.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example I've dropped my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1283138137129193472"&gt;daily paper reading habit&lt;/a&gt; because I decided it wasn't working that well for me - it felt high overhead (because I had to decide to read) and low value (I'd be better served chatting on &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3DkPGuAZiGbeNYlwje6jTlFxz9peIGnjSuZTwF4NGM/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Weird CS Theory Discord&lt;/a&gt;) or reading a book.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another example is that I had a habit of rereading bits of books I'd previously read every day. I've almost entirely dropped that, not deliberately. I think I'm going to formally drop that - doing book driven posts on here fills the same need.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've also, for the moment, dropped my planning system (which was coping board based). It's a good system and I want to get back to it but I think I need to leave some time for my life to normalise into a new routine before I bring it back, and right now it has a bit of guilt attached to it, so I've thrown away the cards and will resume when it feels right to do so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another thing that's been a problem is that I've been reading much less recently. This is I think a loss of a cue - I previously started reading during my morning coffee, which put me in the right mindset for the rest of the day and I would read more later as and when the mood struck me. Recently I've been doing morning pages during morning coffee, which is great and is a high value habit that I will absolutely retain, but robs me of that cue. I've started finishing morning pages by doing at least five minutes of reading, which I'm hoping will help with that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This notebook itself is, of course, one of the daily habits. For the moment I don't plan to drop it as such - I get a lot of value out of it, and I think other people do. Recently it's become a bit erratic and lower quality I think, but it's in the nature of a daily writing practice that that will happen. I might however start skipping days where I've otherwise been doing a lot of writing, or otherwise make some minor modifications to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Questions to Ask When Bored</title>
    <updated>2020-07-17T10:38:40+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Questions to Ask When Bored&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-07-17&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about boredom yesterday and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1283657884392460290"&gt;asked about it on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and had a few conversations about it. This caused me to realise that there are really a lot of different things we're lumping under the heading of boredom, and it might be useful to distinguish them more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of the things we might label as boredom include depression, listlessness, restlessness, fatigue... but rather than trying to put labels on all the different states of being bored I thought it might be useful to narrow it down instead to concrete questions you can ask about the felt sense of the boredom:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I bored of a specific thing that I have to do? (Being in a meeting, working on something tedious, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do I not have anything interesting to do? (e.g. because all of your normal hobbies are inaccessible to you right now)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I unable to find &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; interesting right now? (You're probably depressed)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do the things I am trying to do seem in principle interesting but I'm not in the mood for them? (You might have an unment need and anything that doesn't meet that need)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Am I trying to do things that I don't have the energy for? (You're tired, pick something easier)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there things that I want to do but also want not to do? (e.g. they've got a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-06-09:51.html"&gt;fnord&lt;/a&gt; or an ugh field associated with them)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These questions are all useful debugging tools for helping understand what's actually going on, and treating it as a practical problem to solve. Some of them may be hard to solve in the moment (e.g. if you're exhausted and have no good low energy hobbies it's probably not the right time to try to think of one), but the information they provide in the moment can be used to solve the problem another time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general I find that better introspective understanding also tends to improve my emotional state. Boredom feels bad in part because it signals a poorly understood problem, and getting to the root of what that problem is lessens that feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Annoyingly Hard Algorithm to Beat</title>
    <updated>2020-07-22T13:25:55+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;An Annoyingly Hard Algorithm to Beat&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-07-22&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a vice, and that vice is clever solutions. I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; it when I can hit a problem with some giant theory hammer that cracks it right open. I don't claim this is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; way to solve problems, but it sure is aesthetic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So let me tell you about an algorithm I resent &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;failures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# 10 is arbitrary and the value that works best&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# varies by problem.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;failures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;try_a_random_thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the_thing_succeeded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;failures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;elif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the_thing_was_bad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;failures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I call these failure/success loops. As far as I know they're idiosyncratic to me but I'm sure it's a reinvention because they're so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The basic idea is that you can use them to spend more time on things that have a high chance of succeeding. The parameter value (10 in this case) basically reduces variance at the cost of higher overhead, but either way you end up running things that have a higher chance of working for longer (I haven't bothered to do the maths of the exact distribution, because I inevitably end up using these in situations where success changes the probabiltiy of future successes anyway).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why do I resent the failure/success loop algorithm?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well because it's so dumb and it keeps beating better options.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example suppose you have a multi-armed bandit problem, where you have \(n\) arms and you want to pull arms that succeed and not pull arms that fail. Try the following:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;bandit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;arms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_pulls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;pulls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;failures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Why three? Who knows! But somehow three&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# often ends up being a good choice here.&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;failures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;arm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pull&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="n"&gt;pulls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pulls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;max_pulls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;failures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class="n"&gt;failures&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This keeps pulling each arm until it's failed three times in a row, then moves on to the next one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is this optimal? No, obviously not. This is a well studied problem with lots of interesting theory about regret bounds. From a theoretical point of view this algorithm is garbage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And also every damn time I try to write a multiarmed bandit code and feel super pleased with myself at getting to use some clever theory I find rough edges, go "Hmm... What if I just insert a bit of pregaming to prime the bandit with better information?" and then before I know it I've deleted the bandit code and am left with something that looks like the above.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why does this keep happening?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there are a couple of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is that the situations where they end up beating out clever algorithms for me tend to be ones where &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; is going to work especially well. For example the above bandit algorithm seems to work pretty well in cases where most of the bandit arms have no chance of working and a few of the arms have a not-terrible chance of working. What ends up happening in these cases is that clever algorithms end up not buying you much, occasionally get stuck in weird ways, and you pay high overhead for their complexity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is that the virtue of this algorithm is it's incredibly simple and thus it's easy to tinker with - you can fiddle with the parameter on the fly, you can try other things in the middle, and it pretty much all works fine. There's no complicated state to maintain, and there's plenty of room to maneuver as the result of the simplicity, so even if the base algorithm doesn't work something like it will.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In some sense this is perhaps evidence that the algorithm is less dumb than it seems, but that doesn't mean I resent it any less.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Notes on Reduced Output</title>
    <updated>2020-07-26T11:01:38+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Notes on Reduced Output&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-07-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You've probably noticed that, despite &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html"&gt;my advocacy for daily writing&lt;/a&gt; I've stopped writing here daily.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there are a couple of things going on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is, as noted in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-16-09:22.html"&gt;habit overload&lt;/a&gt; I've got just a bit too much going on habit-wise at the moment, and the daily notebook post has been crowded out a bit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is, a lot of the utility of the notebook has been supplanted for me by other things.
This notebook is a place where I process thoughts and explain things I want to explain, but the former has been taken over by morning pages, and the latter has been taken over by the newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, the notebook is left a bit vestigial. It's not clear what it's purpose is, and it's not quite clear where it fits into everything else in my habit schedule.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a shame, because I like the notebook and I'd quite like to stick with it,
so I think for the next week I'm going to double down on it as follows:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm going to write the notebook post immediately after lunch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm going to use a book prompt every day regardless of whether I feel like writing something else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This should hopefully help it find a better place in my schedule and use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thinking Outside Your Head</title>
    <updated>2020-07-27T17:54:47+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Thinking Outside Your Head&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-07-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As per &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-26-10:40.html"&gt;notes on reduced output&lt;/a&gt; I'm trying to do more book post prompts. Right now I think this will be &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; rough and ready stuff where I'm just gathering together some related thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2LZNHSF"&gt;Behind Human Error&lt;/a&gt; by Woods et al., page 173:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;flexibility tends to create and proliferate modes of operation which create new cognitive demands on practitioners. Practitioners must know more - both about how the system works in each different mode and about how to manage the new set of options in different operational contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Long ago I wrote &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-10-31-16:54.html"&gt;The No Genies Conjecture&lt;/a&gt;, in which I proposed that all systems have at most two of the following properties:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Powerful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flexible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This prompted a good conversation with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisamaphone/status/1252591089900572673"&gt;Chris Martens&lt;/a&gt; about what "easy to use" meant, in that most experts presumably find their tools easy to use.
I think this is a good example of why that is not the case: As flexibility goes up, the amount of state that the expert has to manage in their head will usually exceed the capacity of their week fleshy game.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is also the limitation of what I suggested in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-10-16:52.html"&gt;learning to use the system&lt;/a&gt;, where I talked about how forming mental models is critical to using a system effectively.
In response to this pozorvlak pointed out how one of the features of good UI is to enable the formation of mental models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In particular I thought &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pozorvlak/status/1282994011440021505"&gt;this point was particularly good&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;good UIs foster a good mental model of the system, &lt;em&gt;split over the mind of the user and the information available in the world&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is that this split is rarely well facilitated, especially in systems designed for experts, and this gets only worse as the flexibility of the system grows.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the big problems that comes up a lot in "Behind Human Error" is the problem of &lt;em&gt;modality&lt;/em&gt;. Modal systems are ones where you need different mental models for different states of the system. People commit mode errors when they use a mental model for a different mode.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, I think, points to one of the difficulties of externalising parts of your mental model: what you're externalising it as is, itself, something you need a model for.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know what to do about this, but evidence suggests neither do the people who work on such systems unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Seeing Your Working</title>
    <updated>2020-07-28T10:10:03+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Seeing Your Working&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-07-28&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2ZBIVTz"&gt;Style: Towards Clarity and Grace&lt;/a&gt; by Joseph M. Williams, page 129:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone is thoroughly at home in thinking through a problem, she can suppress in her prose the metadiscourse that records her thinking, allowing little or no of the intellectual process to reach the surface of her prose, or at least to remain the final draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Coincidentally, &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/writing-to-understand"&gt;today's newsletter is about the use of writing to understand rather than communicate&lt;/a&gt;. Using writing specifically as a place where all your thinking goes on the page, and is thereby improved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a complaint I often have: It's essentially impossible to learn to do mathematics by reading research level mathematics, because research level mathematics is performance of this form. A proof as presented is almost &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; a proof as discovered, because the authors have spent a great deal of time refining, generalising, and making the process more elegant. Additionally, it often contains little to no trace of the process that lead to that discovery, and is presented in an entirely different order from that which lead to the underlying insights.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It occurs to me that I would really enjoy reading a book that was just ethnographic studies and interviews of academics, where they talk about the process that lead to some great papers. Ideally these would be by embedded ethnographers who had spent some time observing the academics' actual research process, to try to offset the tendency to historical revisionism that we're all prone to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Inclusivity and Onboarding&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew"&gt;Talking About Machines&lt;/a&gt; by Julian Orr, page 70:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversation of a closely cooperating group can be quite cryptic when the members are sharing information about work; they are considering a well-defined field which can be discussed with considerable economy, verging on code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A thing I have been thinking about a lot recently is the trade off between making a community accessible and the community being able to serve the needs of its core members.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/being-deep-in-an-abstraction-stack"&gt;Being Deep in an Abstraction Stack&lt;/a&gt; I talk about how you need a community of people who share your abstraction stack and there is really no substitute for this no matter how much we want one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately by creating such a community there is a certain amount of inherent gatekeeping: It is a community for people who have that abstraction stack, therefore if you do not have that abstraction stack you cannot participate in the community as a full member. I don't necessarily mean this as a moral judgement - sometimes gateekeeping is good - but there is nevertheless a certain amount of elitism implicit in the existence of such communities. In order to talk about our &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/maintaining-niche-interests"&gt;niche interests&lt;/a&gt; we &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; this cryptic shared language, and attempts to make the group more inclusive by avoiding that will also make it worse for us.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't really have an answer to that other than "deal with it". "I need other people to talk about my interests with" is a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-15-09:33.html"&gt;nice problem to have&lt;/a&gt;, but it's still a need and it's one that it is reasonable to satisfy, and creating slightly exclusionary communities is pretty much the only way to solve that problem..&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I've been thinking about this is &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3DkPGuAZiGbeNYlwje6jTlFxz9peIGnjSuZTwF4NGM/edit"&gt;Weird CS Theory Discord&lt;/a&gt;. The opening paragraph includes the sentence:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to “be” a computer scientist, or even know much computer science, to be here, but if you’re not interested in computer science you probably won’t enjoy the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This hopefully makes it clear that we're not looking to gatekeep (I originally typoed that as "gategeek" which, well, valid) based on formal qualifications, but nevertheless there is a reasonably high bar to participating in the space. People are welcome to join, and they're welcome to learn to become full participants through their experience in the space, but that is there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But, at the same time, we're a tiny free community that I created to serve my particular need for more chatter about weird CS theory. We're absolutely not a computer science institution. We cannot invest a tonne of effort in onboarding people, the best we can possibly hope to do is to be patient and welcoming to people who are still in the process of onboarding themselves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One problem that occurs, and is important to avoid, is when this lack of inclusitivity becomes considered a feature rather than an unfortunate trade off. The specialised language becomes not a useful shorthand but a shibboleth.
I have tried to head that off by making it clear that asking us to explain ourselves is always valid:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[You are encouraged to] Ask questions. (“Can you explain that?” is always fine, though answering “No” is fine too)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have a specific norm that is designed to give people the space to indicate that they need help understanding something, but also a specific norm that we should not exhaust ourselves trying to bring people in.
If people want to bring themselves in, the door is open, but we can only help so much.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this too is exclusionary: Many people don't have the time or resources to do that work themselves.
I feel bad about this, but ultimately the world is still a better place for the community, and there is only so much I can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2yvyoOw"&gt;Democracy in Small Groups&lt;/a&gt; by John Gastil, page 145:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consensus and democracy didn't always work to the satisfaction of the faculty and students at the Meeting School. Even as students obtained ever-greater power, they remaind reluctant to deal with many important issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think an under-appreciated constraint on the running of human civilisation is just how incredibly boring well-functioning politics is. (2020 politics is of course, sadly, not boring).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Worse, it manages to be simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incredibly Boring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extremely detailed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly Stressful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utterly Vital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I feel like this is a combination of factors that a democratic process is almost uniquely poorly suited for, which is I guess why we end up delegating so much of the running of a country to its civil service.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there end up being all sorts of things which have these properties and you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; delegate to a civil service, because they require actual policy decisions, and I feel like we don't really have a good handle on how those work (or, at least &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don't have a good handle on how those work. Is there some sort of ethnographic study of the UK parliament I could read?).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The worst combination seems to happen when a decision &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; an understanding of all these boring details, but people who are not willing to believe that have democratic oversight over the decision anyway.
This is basically how you end up with Brexit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I know enough about how the sausage is made that I wouldn't want a country run entirely by the civil service either (I admit I might still prefer this to the current lot). Experts are, ultimately, still people, and those people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; in some way need to be aligned with the wishes of the populace, at least to the degree that those wishes are reality-based and not actively murderous.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(OK, maybe I &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; want much democracy in the UK, as we seem to be pretty bad at both halves of that)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't have any sort of solution here. I often describe the problem of how to coordinate large groups of people whose interests are only weakly mutually aligned as the fundamental problem of civilisation, so it's not surprising that I'm not going to solve it in a dashed off notebook post, but I do feel like managing this boredom aspect is more important than I had previously realised.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, currently we manage the boredom of politics by getting increasingly frustrated with it and, as a result, eventually deciding to make politics exciting, and that doesn't go so well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Standardised Facts</title>

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2ZB2wmE"&gt;Seeing Like a State&lt;/a&gt; by James C. Scott, page 80:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State simplifications have at least five characteristics that deserve emphasis. Most obviously, state simplifications are observations of only those aspects of social life that are of official interest. They are &lt;em&gt;interested&lt;/em&gt;, utilitarian facts. Second, they are also nearly always written (verbal or numerical) &lt;em&gt;documentary&lt;/em&gt; facts. Third, they are typically &lt;em&gt;static&lt;/em&gt; facts. Fourth, most stylized state facts are also &lt;em&gt;aggregate&lt;/em&gt; facts. Aggregate facts may be impersonal (the density of transportation networks) or simply a collection of facts about individuals (employment rates, literacy rates, residence patterns). Finally, for most purposes, stateofficials need to group citizens in ways that permit them to make a collective assessment. Facts that can be aggregated and presented as averages or distributions must therefore by &lt;em&gt;standardized&lt;/em&gt; facts. However unique the actual circumstances of the various individuals who make up the aggregate, it is their sameness or, more precisely, their differences along a standardized scale or continuum that are of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a very interesting passage that I think I probably just nodded and skimmed over when first reading this book. I find that often the random page approach is a good way of highlighting such passages.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't have a huge amount to say about this passage right now (because I'm ill and it's hot and as a result I am quite stupid today) but I feel like it's especially relevant right now during the COVID-19 epidemic, where we're seeing a lot of this sort of thing. Death rates, hospitalisation rates, etc. are very much an example of standardised facts, and are eliding a lot of the weird and very unpleasant ways in which people's COVID-19 symptoms differ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3fiWsnC"&gt;Jonathan Strange &amp;amp; Mr Norrell&lt;/a&gt; by Susanna Clarke, page 480:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Artists are tricky fellows, sir, forever reshaping the world according to some design of their own," said Strange. "Indeed they are not unlike magicians in that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A thing I often think about is the blurry line between true and useful, communication and performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the context of the story, this is about visual art, but the same happens with the written or spoken word: When we attempt to convey facts, we end up summarising, simplifying, focusing on what we think is important about it, and often when we do this we end up saying things that are not, in the strictest sense, true.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(In context, Norrell is complaining about a painting that has a mirror where there is none).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes this is because we elide crucial details. Sometimes it's a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children"&gt;lie-to-children&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes it's to give the story the true aesthetic without the elaborate scaffolding needed to convey that aesthetic accurately (the mirror).
Sometimes, of course, it's just a lie.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think we end up doing this more than we think, because memory is more fallible than we like to treat it as, and we tend to think more in terms of aesthetic and narrative than detailed recollection of facts. In this sense we are all artists.&lt;/p&gt;
