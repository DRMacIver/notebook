&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please note: This post is much more for me than these posts normally are. It's very stream of consciousness. You might find it interesting anyway, but I can't promise it will make sense.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Basically, I tried to do some maths, and I ended up mostly processing a bunch of feelings instead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do you remember being able to concentrate for a sustained period on some work?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Neither do I, really, but I'm aware it must have happened at some point. A lot of my school reports are the usual smart kid thing to the tune of "David clearly understands the material but I wish he would do the work".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There were a few points in my life where I actually did the work, but most of the rest of the time the work was pretty invisible to me too. I clearly understood the material, but I'm not sure when I did that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the other hand I also spent an entire summer during my A-levels studying a mathematics textbook that would have been a bit advanced a few years into university.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Imagine doing that. It's a struggle for me too. People think I read a lot, and I do, but it's not exactly uninterrupted, and reading a maths textbook is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But why can't I do it? It feels like &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-20-10:33.html"&gt;being blocked&lt;/a&gt;. The capability is clearly there, you just need to do the work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is probably a feelings problem, isn't it? So today, it's time to do some maths and have some feelings about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm going to work through some of the exercises in "A Short Course on Banach Space Theory" by Carothers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why this book?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, it's small, cute, and based on material that I always would have found a bit hard but was once upon a time relevant to my interests.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's also utterly useless. Why would you spend time on this material? I'm sure there's &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; application somewhere, but if so it's probably to things I also don't care about. I'm doing this for the pure joy of doing mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is there joy in mathematics? I feel like there used to be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let's do this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Page 1:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a list of the &lt;em&gt;classical&lt;/em&gt; Banach  spaces. Roughly translated, this means the spaces known to Banach. Once we have these examples out in the open, we'll have plenty of time to fill in any unexplained terminology. For now, just let the words wash over you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do like Carothers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The opening chapter has a lot of "It's easy to see" and "Clearly" and "It follows". I think I'm supposed to be annoyed about those for politics reasons, but fuck it. You're not going to be reading this book unless you have a library card for &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-16-14:22.html"&gt;the ghost library&lt;/a&gt;. Why would you?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; easy to see. It's been 15 years more or less since I finished my maths degree. I've done a little bit of maths in the meantime, but not much, and not particularly advanced. But this is just like riding a bike.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough feelings, lets do some mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't plan to do all the exercises, just the ones that spark joy. Here's chapter 1, exercise 14:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let \(H\) be a separable Hilbert space with orthonormal basis \((e_n)\) and let \(K\) be a compact subset of H. Given \(\epsilon &amp;gt; 0\), show there exists an \(N\) such that \(||\sum\limits_{n = N}^\infty \langle x, e_n \rangle e_n&amp;gt;|| &amp;lt; \epsilon\) for every \(x \in K\).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I stared at it for a little bit then went to have a shower. In the shower the answer was obvious:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let \(y_1, \ldots, y_n\) be an \(\frac{\epsilon}{2}\)-net for \(K\). Then for each \(i\) there exists \(N_i\) such that \(||\sum\limits_{n \geq N_i} \langle y_i, e_n \rangle e_n|| &amp;lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2}\) because these are just the tail sums for \(||y||^2 = \sum \langle y, e_n \rangle^2\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let \(N = \max N_i\). Then for \(x \in K\) we have some \(y_i\) with \(||x - y_i|| &amp;lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2}\) because the \(y_i\) are an \(\frac{\epsilon}{2}\) net.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now
[\begin{align*}
||\sum\limits_{n \geq N} \langle x, e_n \rangle e_n|| &amp;amp; = ||\sum\limits_{n \geq N} \langle y_i, e_n \rangle e_n + \sum\limits_{n \geq N} \langle x - y_i, e_n \rangle e_n|| \\
&amp;amp; \leq ||\sum\limits_{n \geq N} \langle y_i, e_n \rangle e_n|| + ||\sum\limits_{n \geq N} \langle x - y_i, e_n \rangle e_n|| \\
&amp;amp; &amp;lt; \frac{\epsilon}{2} +  \frac{\epsilon}{2} \\
&amp;amp; = \epsilon \\
\end{align*}&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;as desired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;QED etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That was pretty easy. I wasn't exactly &lt;em&gt;surprised&lt;/em&gt; that it was easy, but I'm pretty sure I'm "supposed" to have forgotten that material.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How was the proof obvious to me? Well, "compact" means "small" basically, so I needed to use that smallness somehow. The construction of an \(\epsilon\)-net is the obvious way to use that smallness for something like this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What makes it obvious? I don't know. Mostly that it tends to work I guess. It's &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-12-11:35.html"&gt;intuition&lt;/a&gt;. Once you think to try the approach it's relatively easy to see how it must work. I'm not sure what caused me to try the approach, my brain just said "Hey maybe an \(\epsilon\)-net?" and I checked it out and it seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is this result interesting? I don't know. I don't find I care about the result intrinsically. Maybe it will be useful later?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It doesn't need to be useful though. Joy of mathematics, remember? I'm doing this to see whether I can, not because I care about this. Part of why I picked this book up is that I have no conceivable use for the material. There will be no obligation to carry on after.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I find I still don't &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html"&gt;alieve&lt;/a&gt; I can concentrate on doing mathematics all day, but I'm prepared to try to suspend that alief for a while and see where the day takes me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's try another exercise. Exercise 2.1:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Given a nonzero vector \(x\) in a normed space \(X\), show that there exists a norm one functional \(f \in X^*\) satisfying \(|f(x)| = ||x||\). On the othe rhand, give an example of a normed space \(X\) and a norm one linear functional \(f \in X^*\) such that \(|f(x)| &amp;lt; ||x||\) for every \(0 \neq x \in X\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I just noticed that I was sitting at an extremely odd angle writing this, twisting my spine around. That can't be good for me. I should really use this to practice some Alexander Technique and pay more attention to unlearning those habits, but too much to try at once in think. For now I'll just notice and practice some basic posture unfucking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first bit is just Hahn-Banach. Take the one-dimensional space spanned by \(x\) and define \(f(x) = ||x||\) there. This is a norm one functional and by Hahn-Banach you can extend it to a norm-one functional on the whole space.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This feels too easy. Does he want me to prove Hahn-Banach? I doubt it. But the proof is just blah blah blah Zorn's lemma blah.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the second bit was more interesting and took a bit more thought. The answer is to take \(l^1\) and to define \(f(x) = \sum (1 - \frac{1}{n}) x_n\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This satisfies the requirements because \(|f(x)| = |\sum (1 - \frac{1}{n}) x_n| \leq \sum |(1 - \frac{1}{n}) x_n| =  \sum |(1 - \frac{1}{n})| |x_n| \leq \sum |x_n| = ||x||\) with the last inequality being an equality only when \(x = 0\). This gives us that \(||f|| \leq 1\) and that \(|f(x)| &amp;lt; ||x||\) for \(x \neq 0\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Odd twist to my posture again).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To see that this has norm exactly one, note that \(f(e_n) = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \to 1\) as \(n \to \infty\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How did I spot this example?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well it was kinda obvious. You can't have such a space be finite dimensional (compactness of unit ball etc) so you need to make it so that the norm is closer and closer to \(1\) each time you extend it. Basically all this is doing is extending the functional for each unit vector one at a time, bringing it closer and closer to norm \(1\) with each step.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That's a bit of a retcon though. The intuition was there but I spent a while futzing around trying to make this work with variants on \(l^\infty\) where it doesn't work for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I find myself wondering why I'm doing this. What's the point?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I found I wanted to describe this feeling as wanting to check Twitter. I don't think that's accurate. It's more a feeling of... restlessness? A desire to get up and pace?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a definite sense that &lt;em&gt;I am not the sort of person who can do this&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Very well. I shall get up and pace. But I'll read chapter 2 while doing it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, I've read chapter 2 now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If it seems odd that I was reading chapter 2 after doing the exercises, bear in mind that a) I've read the first couple chapters of this book before. It has been sitting on my shelves for well over a decade now after all and b) This is mostly recap stuff.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While reading this chapter I was definitely going "Blah blah blah proofs" for a lot of this. That will probably bite me later, but I think it's normal. Mathematicians mostly don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; proofs, we like nice, tidy theorems (unless we're into combinatorics in which case we like ugly technical theorems).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do notice that I still tend to think of myself as a mathematician despite it being objectively not true. I have a masters in mathematics, but I've never been a professional mathematician. Still, it's had a significant amount of influence on my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wonder if that identification is part of the emotional noise around doing mathematics? If I'm over-identified with being a mathematician, realising that I'm not actually very good at it would be emotionally painful. Attempting to get better at mathematics is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;unsafe&lt;/a&gt; as a result, so it's no wonder that I tend to stall when I learn new things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It doesn't help that most of the mathematics I've tried to learn in the intervening period has been stuff that at university I would have turned my nose up at. Combinatorics, statistics, graph theory. It's all stuff that is objectively very &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; but isn't something I find intrinsically interesting. There's no &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; there to drive the growth.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is stupid though. Statistics, for example, is just quantitative epistemology. I &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; epistemology. Maybe I'm doing it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, for now, that doesn't matter. I'm focused on something that I would have liked at university. Joy of mathematics, don't you know.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not that I'm feeling much joy right now. It's not &lt;em&gt;unpleasant&lt;/em&gt; though.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's do another exercise. 2.6: Prove Riesz's lemma: Given a closed subspace \(Y\) of a normed space \(X\) and an \(\epsilon &amp;gt; 0\), there is a norm one vector \(x \in X\) such that \(||x - y|| &amp;gt; 1 - \epsilon\) for all \(y \in Y\). If \(X\) is infinite dimensional, use Riesz's lemma to construct a sequence of norm one vectors (x_n \in X) satisfying \(||x_n - x_m \geq \frac{1}{2}\) for all \(m \neq n\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NB. there's a stupid error in the question, in that obviously \(Y\) has to be a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; subspace for this to work otherwise \(X = Y\) is a counter-example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, prove the first bit...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So we're all about the functionals right now, right? Suppose we had some norm one linear functional \(f\) such that \(f(y) = 0\) for \(y \in Y\). This would give us what we want, because we can find some \(x\) with \(||x|| = 1\) and \(f(x) &amp;gt; 1 - \epsilon\). Then for \(y \in Y\) we have \(f(x - y) = f(x) &amp;gt; 1 - \epsilon\). But \(|f(x - y)| \leq ||x - y||\), because \(f\) is norm one, so \(||x - y|| \geq |f(x - y)| &amp;gt; 1 - \epsilon\) as desired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Can we construct such a functional?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I want to say that it's obvious that we can as follows:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Actual desire to check Twitter just then. Apparently my brain wants to glitch out and stop me working on this)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can construct the quotient space \(Q = X / Y\), and there is a linear functional \(g\) of norm one on this space, which taking \(f = g \cdot q\) where \(q: X \to Q\) is the quotient map, gives us a linear functional of norm one on the original space.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not obvious to me that this has norm one though? It certainly has norm at most one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also prove the following result by more blah blah Zorn nonsense: Let \(X\) be a vector space, \(Y \subseteq X\) a proper subspace and \(x \in Y \setminus X\), do the usual Hahn-Banach extension shenanigans to get a functional on \(&amp;lt;\{x\} \cup Y&amp;gt;\) by adding in elements of \(y\) not in the span of what's already covered and setting them to \(0\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is more or less assuming what I'm trying to prove though. It's maybe simpler than this?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things I'm worrying about is that \(\epsilon\). Presumably we can't set \(\epsilon = 0\), so maybe there's some reason we can't expect to extend this with \(f(x) = 1\)?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm currently being reminded of Andrew Wiles on &lt;a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/09/20/the-state-of-being-stuck/"&gt;being stuck&lt;/a&gt;. This is, I think, another example of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html"&gt;discomfort tolerance&lt;/a&gt; being very important for good epistemics, although I think the discomfort is net harmful here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What I'd &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; is to cultivate some open curiousity and just sit with the problem. I'm feeling restless though. I'm going to read up on the proof of the Hahn-Banach theorem from Rudin's "Real and Complex Analysis" and see how I get on with that, then probably go do some staff spinning in the garden for a bit. I've been doing this for over an hour now, so it's probably time to take a quick break.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Weird posture again. Found I was twisted around and also sitting on one my legs)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I went to the bathroom instead and had some more thoughts, so writing these down before I go outside:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found myself wondering... I've been quite blocked on PhD work recently. If I can just sit down and grind through it like this, can I deploy the same skill at my PhD? I should be able to, and I &lt;em&gt;do not like&lt;/em&gt; that thought. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-15-06:31.html"&gt;Capabilities can be coerced&lt;/a&gt; and self-coercion is a thing. If I can do it, then I should do it, and if I should do it, then I am bad for not doing it. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html"&gt;This isn't true&lt;/a&gt; but it feels true. This almost put the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html"&gt;brakes&lt;/a&gt; on the whole thing but I'm going to try to stay with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This whole thing feels &lt;em&gt;annoying&lt;/em&gt;. There are &lt;em&gt;details&lt;/em&gt; and I don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; details. The details are &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt;. Being annoyed makes me want to say "Fuck it, this is pointless, don't want to deal with it".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thought just now: Of course it's pointless. It was deliberately chosen to be pointless. Why am I doing this again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feels like I have an ulterior motive that I'm not admitting to myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's difficult to distinguish between "can't do this" and "don't want to do this", especially when the latter is liable to cause my brain to glitch out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well I'm back from staff spinning now. That was interesting. The movements were energetic, violent, in a way that they usually aren't. I knew I was annoyed, but am I... angry? Does mathematics make me angry?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It would make sense if it did maybe. Anger is very focusing. Certainly some of my more productive coding sessions have been because I got angry about something and decided to just defeat it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In many ways, focus is the &lt;em&gt;point&lt;/em&gt; of anger. It lets you exclude everything but the problem in front of you, and raises the energy level you have to bring to bear on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm not good at anger. Or rather, perhaps, the problem is that I am &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good at anger, and that feels unsafe. You've seen me cranky, but believe me that's not the same thing. Very few people reading this will ever have seen me in a proper rage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of that is that I had a very angry childhood. I did not get on well with other children.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of this was that I was a strange, poorly socialised, child who was quite hard to relate to. I hadn't really figured out how to human, and the people around me hadn't really figured out how to teach me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of this was systemic failures of the school system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A substantial part of this was that a significant number of kids around me were vicious little thugs and the teachers who were supposed to be responsible for protecting the children were culpable in a vast institutional betrayal of those in their care and they all deserve to die in a fire.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Huh, yes. Apparently I &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; angry. I don't actually think they deserve to die in a fire. I understand adolescent development, I understand incentives, I mostly do not think the people involved were intrinsically bad people so much as part of a broken system. But normally I'm quite surprised at how inaccessible anger about the whole thing feels. I don't feel like I'm &lt;em&gt;allowed&lt;/em&gt; to be angry, because of empathy and understanding of systemic problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I saw a therapist briefly last year. She wasn't very useful, but she did get the ball rolling. We had a conversation at one point about how bad my school experience was and she said that I must be very angry about it. "Oh sure but blah blah systemic issues" I lightly answered. I thought I was telling the truth, but maybe I was lying.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, enough about childhood trauma, lets focus on important things like irrelevant pure mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;...right after writing that the song that came on Spotify rotation was VNV Nation's "Illusion".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Opening lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it's hard to tell how mixed up you feel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoping what you need is behind every door&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time you get hurt, I don't want you to change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because everyone has hopes, you're human after all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feeling sometimes, wishing you were someone else&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling as though you never belong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feeling is not sadness, this feeling is not joy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly understand. Please, don't cry now&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Reader, I did not obey their request, and had to retreat to my room to have a little cry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Accidentally &lt;a href="https://nibrasi.co.uk/the-lost-art-of-crying"&gt;NEDERAing&lt;/a&gt; myself with a textbook on some Banach space theory is some serious &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html"&gt;everything is connected&lt;/a&gt; bullshit right there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's almost like there's some unprocessed emotions associated with the thing that I spent four years of my life on, the last one burning me out right to the edge of quitting before giving me a decidedly mediocre grade on something that I had connected a significant chunk of my identity to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No, seems fake. Lets do some maths.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The traditional approach on an exam when you're stuck is to go do some other questions, so lets try another one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First though, I have retrated to my room. I like my flatmates very much, but we do not have the sort of relationship where I particularly want to be crying in front of them, and apparently that's what's on the cards today.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course this presents its own problem, which is that I don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; spending time in my room. I don't entirely know why. I've been vaguely intending to do Focusing on the problem by spending a bunch of time in my room and seeing how it feels, and by "vaguely intending" I mean "I have absolutely no intention of doing this because it sounds &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the drivers of this is that I'm very bad at maintaining my personal space. I've bought a copy of &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2yeCQ4i"&gt;Unfuck Your Habitat&lt;/a&gt; to try to offset that, but it hasn't arrived yet. Currently my habitat... well it's not &lt;em&gt;unhygienic&lt;/em&gt; or anything but it's cluttered as fuck and I really should do something about that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For now though I'm going to do some vacuuming. My new coping board tells me I should do that on the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Procrastinating? I'm sure I don't know what you mean. Next you'll be telling me that my sudden desire to rearrange all my furniture is procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have successfully resisted the urge to rearrange all my furniture. Time for some mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;2.7: Given linear functionals \(f\) and \((g_i)_{i = 1}^n\) on a vector space, prove that \(\text{ker} f \supseteq \bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^n \text{ker} g_i\) if and only if \(f = \sum a_i g_i\) for some \(a_i \in \mathbb{R}\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The if is easy: If \(x \in  \bigcap\limits_{i = 1}^n \text{ker} g_i\) then \(f(x) = \sum a_i g_i(x) = \sum a_i 0 = 0\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The only if...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I stared at a problem for a bit and did some work on it and then took a twenty minute WhatsApp break to chat to people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with this is that the analysis bit I'm good at, the linear algebra, not so much.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose without loss of generality that the \(g_i\) are linearly independent. Then we can find \(x_i\) with \(g_i(x_i) = 1\) and and \(g_i(x_j) = 0\) for \(i \neq j\) basically by... the thing you do to to construct an orthogonal vector? &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process"&gt;Gram-Schmidt elimination&lt;/a&gt;, right. You do it progressively, starting with any \(y\) such that \(g(y) = 1\) and \(y \not\in &amp;lt;\{x_j : j &amp;lt; i\}&amp;gt;\). Then you set \(x_i = y - \sum\limits_{j &amp;lt; i} g_i(x_j) x_j\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Does this work? I don't think this works.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ugh, the annoying thing I'm finding is that I've still got the right conceptual framework, but I'm no longer any good at the detail work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This might be a retcon though. I'm not sure I was &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; good at the detail work. I've always leaned very heavily on conceptual framework stuff.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lets go back to my first thought, which is that there's a dimensionality trick here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Feelings interrupt: Persistent internal exchange to the tune of "Ugh this is awful. I'm being &lt;em&gt;forced to do things I'm bad at&lt;/em&gt;." "Are you being forced? You can stop if you want. Do you want to stop?" "...no" "Well then lets keep going until you do.". Discomfort tolerance is hard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, dimension trick.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For finite dimensional \(V\) we have \(\text{dim}(V) = \text{dim}(V*)\). So if \(f \not\in \text{span}(g_i)\) then we must be able to find \(x_1, \ldots, x_n\) such that the restriction of the \(g_i\) to \(X = &amp;lt;\{x_i\}&amp;gt;\) are linearly independent. Necessarily \(f|_X \in &lt;g_i|_x\&gt;\), say \(f|_X = \sum a_i g_i|_X\). Let \(f' = \sum a_i g_i\). &lt;/g_i|_x\&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If \(f' = f\) then we're done. Otherwise there is some \(y\) such that \(f'(y) \neq f(y)\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm going to go have some lunch.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm back from lunch. I had stew. It was nice. I also now have a pot of genmaicha tea, and have taken some ibuprofen and theanine to go with it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The caffeine/theanine/ibuprofen stack is a fairly productive one for me, but I do suspect part of that is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/m_ashcroft/status/1246749019201732610"&gt;the suppression of feelings&lt;/a&gt; oh well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Over lunch I was thinking about three things:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dissociation, and how many behaviours are about avoiding feelings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anger, and the way we treat male anger as intrinsically dangerous and how much disservice this does to men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linear algebra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lets focus on the important one: Linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I had seemingly forgotten the obvious fact that a linear functional consists of a decomposition of a vector space \(V = &lt;x&gt; \oplus \text{ker}(f)\). I'm not sure if this helps here.&lt;/x&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I thought I might have a go at some of the chapter 1 exercises, see if I fare any better there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, an easy one. 2.5, show that \(l^\infty\) is not separable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ugh, I've just realised that a lot of the mathematics in this post is invalid LaTeX. I've also remembered how much I fucking hate LaTeX.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an area where the "optimised" workflow of my notebook is seriously lacking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, maths.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is easy. For any \(A \neq B \subseteq \mathbb{N}\), we have \(||1_A - 1_B||_\infty = 1\), so \(\{B(1_A, \frac{1}{2}): A \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) is an uncountable set of non-empty open sets. A dense set intersects every open set, so no dense set can be countable because it must contain at least one element of each of these.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is kinda what I meant earlier about being better at the conceptual work than the details. Things that are easily solvable with an intuitive leap are fine (although I might have remembered this one, I'm not sure), but things where there are multiple steps involved to figure out the conclusion are hard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm now trying 1.7: Let \(1 &amp;lt; p &amp;lt; \infty\) and let \(\frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} = 1\). Show that for positive real numbers \(a and b\) we have \(ab \leq \frac{a^p}{p} + \frac{b^q}{q}\) with equality if and only if \(a = b\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm a little suspicious of that "equality if" part but lets see how this goes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, lets check \(a = b\). Then the right hand side is \(\frac{a^p}{p} + \frac{a^q}{q}\). Sanity check, when \(p = q = 2\) this gives us \(a^2 = a^2\) as desired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I feel like the claim that the two sides are equal if \(a = b\) just has to be bullshit in general though.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pick, say, \(p = 3\). Then \(q = \frac{3}{2}\). Then the claim that the two sides are equal is the claim that \(a^2 = \frac{1}{3} a^3 + \frac{2}{3} a^{\frac{3}{2}}\), which is just obvious nonsense (e.g. check a = 2). So I'm going to assume the "if" part is a mistake (a lot of the exercises in this book seem to be wrong).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let \(f(a) = \frac{a^p}{p} + \frac{a^q}{q}\). Then \(f'(a) = a^{p - 1} + a^{q - 1}\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'd like to see how this scales. Without loss of generality, assume \(a \leq b\). Write \(b = x\) with \(x \geq 1\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This inequality now becomes \(a^2 x \leq \frac{a^p}{p} + \frac{a^q}{q} x^q\)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a joke that mathematicians are machines for turning coffee into theorems. If, as previously observed, it is helpful to be angry when doing mathematics, and coffee makes you irritable (it certainly seems to), is that the mechanism?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this point I moved to paper and the results were a mess, so I'm not going to bother to transcribe them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think, at this point, I have to admit that my skill in working with mathematics is severely degraded. This shouldn't be surprising, but somehow it is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think because I've retained a lot of the conceptual machinery of mathematics, I've assumed I could still do this sort of thing reasonably well, when in fact a lot of what matters is the detailed fine grained machinery of doing the work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Equally, I'm not sure this was ever &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; for me, so maybe I'm inferring more loss than was there. This is very focused on the nitty gritty algebraic manipulation bits which, frankly, I've always been crap at.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this point I did the standard thing I do when I get stuck in a puzzle game: Give up and look at a walkthrough.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is apparently called Young's inequality (I remembered it was a standard one, but not what it was called), and according to Wikipedia is an easy consequence of the concavity of the logarithm. I can kinda see how that works and I could probably work through the details, but I think this requires me to have a refresher course.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I looked at &lt;a href="https://www.math.upenn.edu/~brweber/Courses/2011/Math361/Notes/YMandH.pdf"&gt;these notes&lt;/a&gt; and they instead use the convexity of the exponential, which I think is a little nicer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway I see the details of this but also find I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don't want to work through them. The idea feels... disgusting? Beneath me?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't think it is. I think it would in fact be very good for me to work through the details. But I &lt;em&gt;really don't want to do it&lt;/em&gt;, and I think I will respect that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm going to go outside for a bit and do some more staff spinning.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The earlier anger has passed. Instead I'm left with a kind of... despair? Despair isn't right. It feels &lt;em&gt;pointless&lt;/em&gt;, and it is. I deliberately picked it because it was a bit pointless. But I'm not actually struggling with any of those parts. I'm struggling with some really basic shit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This all, I think, ties in with a bunch of basic blocks I have around maintenance and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html"&gt;care work&lt;/a&gt;. There's a kind of... what's the point of doing this when I'm just going to hve to do it again in future? I spent four years getting good at this sort of thing, but because I haven't maintained it, I've lost crucial skills.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I could probabbly claim some of them back, but doing so feels... futile? Like I'd just lose them again, and then I'd have wasted more time of the finite time left before I eventually die.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Bleak. The word for this mood is &lt;em&gt;bleak&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do feel like I would benefit from getting back into mathematics, but I don't think retreading old steps will get me there. I think it will just increase the level of negative pushback I'm getting from my emotions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the feeling that I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do this is part of the problem. There's a huge internal response of "Shan't. It's pointless".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think picking something that I &lt;em&gt;used&lt;/em&gt; to find interesting was a mistake. I have an ongoing problem where I find something niche interesting, lose interest in it, and then feel like I've wasted my time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Given that that's how I'm starting to feel about my PhD I think that was a particularly big mistake here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to find my way back into being able to do the detail work of mathematics, I think perhaps the way in is through statistics. It requires careful going - there are a number of problems with getting myself interested in statistics, but it's the most immediately useful to me and it ties in to a bunch of things I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; still care about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think it would be dangerous to try to push through this mood, so I'm going to call this post to a close soon, but let's try to end on a high note by seeing if my new book reading techniques work well for some things in this space.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's a random page from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2z3KLBu"&gt;Reliable Reasoning&lt;/a&gt;, page 49:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of this result is that, if the classification rules in C do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have a finite VC dimension, then no matter how mnay data points are provided, there will be probability distributions for which enumerative induction will not select only rules with expected error close to the minimum for rules in C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hmm. I think I get what this is getting at, but it's been long enough since I've read this book that I'm honestly not sure, I'm going to just reread the book up to that point (not normally viable with a textbook, I'll grant!) and see where we are here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nope, I think I'm done, the ugh field has got too strong for today.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To end on a high note, I think I've learned a couple of important things today:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; manage much more focused work on something like this than I thought I could. Admittedly I mostly ended up processing feelings around the work than doing the work, but I think that in and of itself is quite productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's an interesting link to anger with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stream of consciousness writing while I attempt work is actually quite productive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I should reread "Reliable Reasoning" as a possible next steps into regaining some skills I've lost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's probably a very strong set of emotional ughs tied together around this, and I suspect sorting some of the other ones out might make a lot of this more accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What I &lt;em&gt;haven't&lt;/em&gt; learned much about is Banach space theory, but oh well. It wasn't likely to be very useful anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Model Monocropping</title>

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Model Monocropping&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-04&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What is a model?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a good passage about models in the beginning of Cailin O'Connor's "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3c3Ap2Z"&gt;The Origins of Unfairness&lt;/a&gt;":&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the book addresses many related phenomena these discussions necessarily vary in levels of carefulness. Some of the models presented are tied to the relevant phenomena quite tightly. Others are suggestive of the phenomena, but the details are not filled in as meticulously. This means that the explanatory role of the models will differ from case to case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, the models discussed can be thoguht of as providing "how-possibly" information. If something can evolve in an evolutionary model under basic conditions, we come to believe that these conditions are enough to possibly support the evolution of that behavior in the real world. In other cases, I take the models to have deeper explanatory power, giving us insight into how some patterns of behavior may have &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; emerged. The difference here is not in the models but in the epistemic role they play. In the "how-potentially" cases, the models are intended to increase our confidence in the potential of a process to really have occurred. In particular, many of the examples of how-potentially modelling in the book will involve what Weisberg describes as minimalist  idealization, where the model pares away causally irrelevant factors to reveal candidates for the underlying causal variables responsible for a phenomenon. In still other cases, I will argue that the models discussed play an important epistemic role by outlining the minimal conditions for certain social patterns - especially inequitable ones - to arise, regardless of how those patterns were actually generated in the real world. This kind of "how-minimally" modelling is especially useful in thinking about intervention. For instance, suppose we intervene on real groups via implicit bias training. If inequity emerges under minimal conditions that do not include biases, we should not expect this intervention to fully solve our problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, sometimes the same model will play multiple epistemic roles. For example, I provide models of the emergence of gender roles that I think potentially illuminate how these patterns emerged in the real world. At the same time, they demonstrate how such roles can possibly emerge from minimal preconditions. Altogether, the explanatory picture that emerges echoes Downes (2011), who emphasizes the wide set of explanatory roles that models can play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Downes (2011) is &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2011.00441.x"&gt;Scientific Models by Stephen M. Downes&lt;/a&gt;, who says:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of models in science has been a focus of philosophical discussion for at least a century. In what follows, I provide some examples of scientific models, introduce some of the relevant philosophical discussion about models and then focus in on issues arising from a specific view about what models do: all scientific models are representations of parts of the world. I side with an emerging consensus that this unified view is not tenable. Scientific models play a number of different epistemological roles in scientific inquiry and as a result, philosophical inquiry about models should be pursued in a number of different directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am reminded of a quote from Gelman and Shalizi's &lt;a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/philosophy.pdf"&gt;Philosophy and the practice of Bayesian statistics&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social-scientific data analysis is especially salient for our purposes because there is general agreement that, in this domain, all models in use are wrong – not merely falsifiable, but actually false. With enough data – and often only a fairly moderate amount – any analyst could reject any model now in use to any desired level of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A model is in some sense a &lt;em&gt;toy world&lt;/em&gt;. It captures some salient feature of the real world in a way that you can reason about more concretely. These toy worlds idealise the real world, typically to some very large degree, but in doing so they have a powerful advantage over the real world: They can be manipulated and tested, and reasoned about from the omniscient view. The models contain uncertainty, but the uncertainty is generally purely probabilistic, not &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knightian_uncertainty"&gt;Knightian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sort of abstraction of the real world is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-02-18-08:58.html"&gt;how mathematics works in general&lt;/a&gt; - creating abstract objects that we can set up correspondences with, that are not themselves physically real, but that we can use to understand reality better through analogy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This can illuminate our understanding of the world in a purely descriptive way - the model as hermeneutic resource, a tool of interpretation, one of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-27-07:57.html"&gt;the stories we tell each other&lt;/a&gt; - but of course one of the key advantages of a model is that you can use them for decision support.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As I've argued before, the way to think about decision making is not to try to imagine what an optimal idealised decision maker would do, but to think instead about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;doing a decent job under bounded resources&lt;/a&gt;. In this sense, models are clearly often going to be useful despite being "wrong", if they help you make better decisions than you would at random.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this sense you can think of models as members of a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-13-11:35.html"&gt;domus&lt;/a&gt; - abstract objects that we have domesticated to our service. When the models tend to result in bad decisions, they get culled, and new ones form in their place.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It will rarely be the case that these models get selected for &lt;em&gt;truth&lt;/em&gt; exactly, because truth is complex and not always that useful. Instead they will be selected for whether the errors they make are inconvenient. A model that is more accurate on average but less accurate in cases where it causes a critical error will tend to be selected against.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Statistics, in this view, is a tool for model generation (especially parameter tuning) and selection (model checking lets you cull models that produce worse results).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, the passive voice there hides who is doing the selection. In a domus, evolution is no longer just a blind force, but is guided by intentional choices made by the people involved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong"&gt;As the saying goes&lt;/a&gt;, all models are wrong, but some are useful. But useful to whom?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We have a tendency in agriculture to monocropping: Finding the "best" crop and just doing more of that. The results are less interesting and fragile, and tend to ignore certain externalities in their endless optimisation (this is why storebought tomatos are boring). This sucks if that monocrop is less suitable for you - a society that bases all their diet on wheat sucks if you're gluten intolerance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We also tend to count "best" heavily weighted towards power, which tends to neglect the needs of those with less power, who are typically minorities. Therefore the errors in our models will tend to be heavily weighted towards minimizing ones that will affect those with power.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is one of the reasons it's important to seek out niche &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html"&gt;nerddoms&lt;/a&gt; - they will tend to provide you with models from outside the monocrop.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Often these models will be &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; in some sense. They will work less well if you're in the majority. Often they will be poorly thought through or optimised compared to mainstream models. This is because they are optimised for a smaller number of people for whom those mainstream models were optimised for.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, their inclusion in a healthy model ecosystem is vital, because they capture aspects of reality that we would otherwise ignore, because they come from people for whom those aspects are of vital importance. Further, often through synthesis they allow us to come up with hybrid models that work better for everybody.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href="https://letter.wiki/conversation/610"&gt;an interesting discussion on letter wiki&lt;/a&gt; that John Nerst linked to recently that contained the following gem:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Atheism, to my mind, never grappled honestly with this fact about human nature, often preferring a speculative "mind virus" theory, which disparaged religion as a kind of cognitive parasite and suggested that we could, if only we inoculated the vulnerable, rid the human species of the nasty pestilence of religious belief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this was dishonesty as much as a form of projection. There are people for whom an established and popular idea never makes sense and they believe that they worked this out rather than just had a psychology for which it didn’t work.  It is then easy for them to assume that they can bring other people into this mindset. I see this with queer theorists. They are often people who lie outside of norms themselves when it comes to gender presentation and sexuality and they then rationalise &amp;amp; moralise this and try to get other people to do it but other people don’t want to because they don’t lie outside the norm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I in fact think both the religion-as-meme and queer theory models are very useful ones that are worthwhile to have in a healthy, functioning, memetic ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I also think a lot of people who are mostly "in the norm" could benefit from at least a bit of queer theory, but it's true that most people are probably right not to bother)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do agree that both tend to get overapplied by their advocates, but I feel the world is richer for them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason they get overapplied is that we've all bought too heavily into the idea of the model monocrop. We don't just want our models to be useful, we want them to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;, and that must mean that other people's models are false, and so we must argue our model into dominance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But this isn't healthy. The solution is not to replace the monocrop with a better one, it's to end monocropping altogether. If &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html"&gt;all knowledge is connected&lt;/a&gt; then one consequence of that is that the problems we want to solve are too complicated to perfectly model with anything short of reality itself, which defeats the purpose of having the models.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead we need something closer to model &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture"&gt;permaculture&lt;/a&gt;, holding a number of (potentially highly &lt;a href="https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/post/writing-20200504/"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;) models, which we fluidly switch between as and when it seems needful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Making Success Trivial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When trying to acquire some habit or perform some practice, it's worth making your bar for success &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; low. Essentially, if there's any question of whether you're able to do it at a given time, that should be a sign that you're significantly compromised (ill, depressed, dealing with a crisis, etc).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The classic example of this is in meditation practice: Success is putting your ass on the meditation cushion and closing your eyes for a breath. Maybe you'll do a two hour sit after that, maybe not. You can feel good about it either way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other examples for me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a rereading practice. Every day I try to reread something from a book I have previously read. The only requirement is that it is a book that I have previously read and I read at least a page from it. I usually read more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have (as of yesterday, so we'll see how this one pans out) committed to spending 10 minutes per day tidying my bedroom.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general I expect to do a lot more than the bare minimum for the first most days, and I expect to be right on the edge of the bare minimum for the second (update: I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I actually wanted to do more today and did a full half an hour of cleaning). That's OK, both are success.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A daily writing practice can also be made trivial, but it requires a bit more setup work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is: The metric for success is that you have written something, in the place where you said you would write it. You probably shouldn't even set a minimum word count. You &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; shouldn't set a minimum quality count. All you need to do to succeed at writing is write.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is: If you can't make the task intrinsically easier, having a repertoire of strategies for achieving it can be very helpful. For things where the practice might require thought, it's useful to have tools for minimising that. For example, the approach of picking a random passage from a book, copying it out, and writing a few thoughts prompted by it, is one that guarantees that I can succeed at my writing practice if I feel like I don't have any thoughts to write about. The Tarot prompts work in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once you've made the practice trivial, a couple things can happen:
Everything can go great, you might discover that you don't want to do it, and you might discover that you want not to do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What you do if you don't want to do it depends a lot on the task. You might be getting paid to do it, or otherwise need to do it (I certainly don't &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to clean my room right now, but I want the clean room, so...). Or you might decide that actually this isn't worth doing unless you want to do it and abandon it. That's fine too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Wanting to not do it is different though. This is when you have a negative emotional reaction to the experience, possibly despite also wanting to do it. You're trying to do it and then &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html"&gt;the brakes come on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is generally a sign that you need to get debugging and figure out why you're having that reaction. In broad strokes there are two reasons why you have a negative emotional reactions to things: Something is actually wrong, or the situation looks like something that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;you've learned in the past&lt;/a&gt; is bad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In equally broad strokes, there are two solutions to negative emotional reactions: You can change the emotion, or you can change the situation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(There's probably an interesting 2x2 to draw here but I haven't got around to creating a good way to add those to notebook posts)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Changing the emotion can be hard but roughly involves &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html"&gt;figuring out where it comes from and bringing it in line with reality&lt;/a&gt; or acquiring a certain amount of discomfort tolerance. My recommendation is that for the goal of making success trivial you should not set out to do this. Instead, you should understand the nature of the emotional association, and try to find strategies that work around it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The one place where changing the emotional association &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; important for triviality is to add self-compassion: Making sure you understand that &lt;em&gt;this strategy is OK&lt;/em&gt;. That it is better to have a recurring habit of trivial successes that you elaborate on as much or as little as you want than it is to have no habit at all, and to avoid punishing yourself for not meeting a higher standard. Getting comfortable with the method of trivial successes is important to avoid putting an ugh field around the whole subject.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In terms of changing the situation, two things seem to be important and and common here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-11-14:47.html"&gt;Removing trivial irritations&lt;/a&gt; - finding things which are easy to change and make the whole process much less irritating. e.g. listening to a podcast while cleaning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;Creating safety&lt;/a&gt; - finding ways in which the process feels unsafe. For example, writing in private rather than public, or under a pseudonym, until you are comfortable with other people reading your work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One non-obvious way that you might experience the process as unsafe is if it feels like an unbounded commitment. It's important to avoid the "Oh gods, I have to keep doing this &lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;?" reaction, and keeping the level of commitment way down is helpful for doing that. In particular, you might be tempted to ratchet up the difficulty level - to say e.g. that once you're confident that you can read a page a day, you'll increase your minimum commitments, etc. I think it's probably a bad idea to do that, because you'll be aware that you're tricking yourself, and that you're creating a greater commitment for future you, and that might feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another emotion that can be difficult here is not wanting to start because you don't feel like you'll be allowed to stop. One way to deal with that is to give yourself explicit permission to stop. If it's awful, you don't have to keep doing it, you're just trying it on to see what it's like. If that doesn't work out, it's not a bad thing, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;you've learned something&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn't imply anything permanent or bad about you, you can always try again later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cleaning up the fnords in your environment</title>
    <updated>2020-05-06T11:30:15+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Cleaning up the fnords in your environment&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-06&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A "Fnord" is a concept from the rather strange "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2SG4PRi"&gt;Illuminatus! trilogy&lt;/a&gt;". They are explained thus:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That calmed me a little, so I set out the toast and coffee and fetched in the New York Times from the hallway. I turned the radio to WBAI and caught some good Vivaldi, sat down, grabbed a piece of toast and started skimming the first page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I saw the fnords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feature story involved another of the endless squabbles between Russia and the U.S. in the UN General Assembly, and after each direct quote from the Russian delegate I read a quite distinct “Fnord!” The second lead was about a debate in Congress on getting the troops out of Costa Rica; every argument presented by Senator Bacon was followed by another “Fnord!” At the bottom of the page was a Times depth-type study of the growing pollution problem and the increasing use of gas masks among New Yorkers; the most distressing chemical facts were interpolated with more “Fnords.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I saw Hagbard’s eyes burning into me and heard his voice: “Your heart will remain calm. Your adrenalin gland will remain calm. Calm, all-over calm. You will not panic. You will look at the fnord and see it. You will not evade it or black it out. You will stay calm and face it.” And further back, way back: my first-grade teacher writing FNORD on the blackboard, while a wheel with a spiral design turned and turned on his desk, turned and turned, and his voice droned on,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IF YOU DON’T SEE THE FNORD IT CAN’T EAT YOU, DON’T SEE THE FNORD, DON’T SEE THE FNORD …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked back at the paper and still saw the fnords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was one step beyond Pavlov, I realized. The first conditioned reflex was to experience the panic reaction (the activation syndrome, it’s technically called) whenever encountering the word “fnord.” The second conditioned reflex was to black out what happened, including the word itself, and just to feel a general low-grade emergency without knowing why. And the third step, of course, was to attribute this anxiety to the news stories, which were bad enough in themselves anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A fnord is a thing that you have learned not to see, but that still triggers anxiety. It is not actually harmful in and of itself, except through the power of the emotional associations you have developed with it. The fnord can't actually eat you, but you are sufficiently terrified of it that you have learned to completely ignore its presence.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, not how operant conditioning works in reality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have learned not to see the fnords. What would happen if I put my finger on the page where the fnord is and told you there was a fnord there?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, you'd get annoyed at me. "Of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; there's a fnord there." you'd say "Everyone knows there's a fnord there. Why are you drawing my attention to it?" and then you'd get annoyed with me for having the bad taste to talk about fnords.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of John Regehr's &lt;a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/861"&gt;Operant Conditioning by Software Bugs&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever used a new program or system and found it to be obnoxiously buggy, but then after a while you didn’t notice the bugs anymore? If so, then congratulations: you have been trained by the computer to avoid some of its problems. For example, I used to have a laptop that would lock up to the point where the battery needed to be removed when I scrolled down a web page for too long (I’m guessing the video driver’s logic for handling a full command queue was defective). Messing with the driver version did not solve the problem and I soon learned to take little breaks when scrolling down a long web page. To this day I occasionally feel a twinge of guilt or fear when rapidly scrolling a web page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Negative responses from our environment &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;install learned beheaviours&lt;/a&gt; which cause us to avoid them. It's not that we &lt;em&gt;can't see&lt;/em&gt; the fnords, it's that we &lt;em&gt;don't look at them&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The term "&lt;a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields"&gt;ugh field&lt;/a&gt;" apparently comes from Less Wrong (the friend I got it from is not a LW person but maybe she got it from someone who was):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A problem with the human mind — your human mind — is that it's a horrific kludge that will fail when you most need it not to. The Ugh Field failure mode is one of those really annoying failures. The idea is simple: if a person receives constant negative conditioning via unhappy thoughts whenever their mind goes into a certain zone of thought, they will begin to develop a psychological flinch mechanism around the thought. The "Unhappy Thing" — the source of negative thoughts — is typically some part of your model of the world that relates to bad things being likely to happen to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've always had an ugh field around cleaning, and around &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html"&gt;care work&lt;/a&gt; more generally. Reading "&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2A4sFjg"&gt;Unfuck Your Habitat&lt;/a&gt;" recently has been quite helpful with coping with that, and I've added a daily 10 minute tidy of my room to &lt;a href="https://howtosurvivementalillness.tumblr.com/post/162396810334/how-to-make-and-use-a-coping-board"&gt;my coping board&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-05-08:59.html"&gt;prediction yesterday&lt;/a&gt; was that I would stick to that ten minutes to the letter. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not the case. I completed a full &lt;a href="https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/whats-a-2010/"&gt;20/10&lt;/a&gt; of cleaning and then did another 10 minutes to finish it off and restore some order.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Specifically what I did was go through a giant miscellaneous pile of papers and mail, take everything out of its envelopes, and shred or otherwise recycle all of the bits that didn't need to be kept. I then return the pile to where it was in a slightly tidier and smaller form.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A friend asked whether being in a slightly tidier space felt different. My initial answer was that I hadn't really done enough to achieve that - the space looked pretty much as it was before, just with one corner of it slightly tidier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I later realised this wasn't true, there was one signficant difference: The pile of papers was no longer vaguely scary, because I knew what was in it and that it was all stuff that I either didn't need to deal with or was entirely able to deal with.
It wasn't &lt;em&gt;tidy&lt;/em&gt; yet, and so visually speaking the room looked much the same, but the &lt;a href="https://focusing.org/sixsteps"&gt;felt sense&lt;/a&gt; of the room had changed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The pile of papers was no longer a fnord.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't think this is all that's going on with me and cleaning, but I think it's a large part of it. A failure to care for the environment allows the fnords to breed, and once the environment is full of fnords, caring for it requires dealing with them, so the very idea of care acquires an ugh field.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2L1VcrS"&gt;Marie Kondo&lt;/a&gt;'s recommendation of learning to tell if an item sparks joy &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; genuinely an important skill for cleaning, but if you're not going to buy in to the full blown minimalism cult, maybe an equally important emotional skill is learning to see the fnords.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Easy changes and Uncomfortable Reflections</title>
    <updated>2020-05-07T09:36:19+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Easy changes and Uncomfortable Reflections&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As I've talked about in my last two posts (&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-05-08:59.html"&gt;Making success trivial&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-06-09:51.html"&gt;Cleaning up the fnords in your environment&lt;/a&gt;), my bedroom is a mess. I'd like it not to be a mess, and I've recently made two changes that are enabling that:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://howtosurvivementalillness.tumblr.com/post/162396810334/how-to-make-and-use-a-coping-board"&gt;a coping board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Structuring longer cleaning around &lt;a href="https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/whats-a-2010/"&gt;20/10s&lt;/a&gt; (basically just pomodoros, but with some better ergonomics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My room is not currently clean, but it's a little cleaner than it was a week ago, and I think in a month it'll probably be pretty clean and I kinda expect to be able to keep it that way (I'll need to make some more structural changes than this in order to enable that, but these changes will get me to the point where the structural changes that I should make become more obvious).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You may notice something important about these two changes: They're really really easy, and I could have done them at any time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What this means, is that a long-running problem of mine, something that I've been feeling bad about for well over a decade (and had for longer), is something that I could have trivially fixed any time I wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, should I feel guilty about not having done so? More, should I feel &lt;em&gt;ashamed&lt;/em&gt; about not having done so?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Distinction in case it's helpful: Guilt is "I did a bad thing", shame is "I am bad")&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I claim that the answer is no, and the answer is no for a variety of reasons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The main one is that having negative emotional responses to success is maladaptive. It causes you to not want to succeed, and will tend to destroy the motivation to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;try things&lt;/a&gt;, and will cause you to feel bad while building the habit, which will tend to sabotage the habit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It might be right, in some circumstances, to feel a certain amount of guilt or shame over this, as long as they are proportionate (i.e. don't spiral out of control) and are more than counterbalanced by the positive feelings of success, but sucess does require confronting the honest truth that you are capable of succeeding, and that can be very unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you experience success as a negative, you will tend to discourage yourself from succeeding. This is relatively obvious when it's pointed out, but is a very easy trap to fall into. If you have this problem I'd recommend my previous &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/01/a-crash-course-in-having-feelings/"&gt;Crash Course in Having Feelings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On top of that, I think it is &lt;em&gt;factually incorrect&lt;/em&gt; to feel guilt or shame about behaviour change, because it is the nature of change to be easy once it arrives: If you're having to force yourself through a gruelling process to change, you're probably just going to fail.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead what happens is that you gradually build up skills and relationships, or your circumstances change, or one of a dozen other possibilities occur and suddenly change is easy. The thing that makes change easy now wouldn't necessarily have worked if you'd tried it five years ago, or ten, and even if it had worked you wouldn't have necessarily known how to find it among the thousands of other equally easy things that seemed equally plausible but wouldn't have worked for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Separating Impulse from Action</title>
    <updated>2020-05-08T13:04:37+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Separating Impulse from Action&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-08&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's a trick I figured out yesterday. It solves quite a specific problem that I have, but you might have similar problems, and even if not I think it demonstrates some useful general principles that could be applied in other circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is this: I buy too many books.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not a &lt;em&gt;disaster&lt;/em&gt; because I also read a lot of books, but I buy books at a higher rate than I read them, and I often buy books that I later decide that actually I'm not realistically going to read.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is basically that when I encounter an interesting book whose ideas I would like inside my brain, I often impulsively buy it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of this is a problem of impulse control, for sure, and I could definitely fix it by being better at impulse control, but currently I'm trying to be &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; good at impulse control, so that seems counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An additional complication is that the correct amount of books for me to be buying is not zero. I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; just blanket ban myself from buying books. I would experience it as unpleasant, but it's manageable, but that would not result in my buying the right number of books.
I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; read a lot of books (typically between one and three a week, not counting fiction which are a separate category because I read them as ebooks), and I like having new books around, and I can definitely afford to spend a certain amount of money on books.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The additional complicating factor is that my bookshelves serve as a kind of... thoughts I want to have later? They're a TODO list for reading, and my experience is that I will lose track of digital TODO lists for reading - they will get too large, and I will forget about them and leave them to rot (I am even worse at digital &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html"&gt;care work&lt;/a&gt; than physical).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, I:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a constant impulse to buy books, and suppressing it will be unpleasant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do actually want to buy a non-zero amount of books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need a way to keep track of the books I may want to buy later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there's an easy solution, and it's &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html"&gt;kinda stupid&lt;/a&gt; that it's taken me this long to realise it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The solution that satisfies all of these is to have:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a default Amazon list of books I wanted to buy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a scheduled task every Sunday to buy a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now when I want to impulse buy a book I instead just click the add to list button instead of the buy now button. Then, every Sunday, I go through the list and decide which of these books is the one I want to buy the most right now. In the course of doing so, I remove any books from the list that I'm definitely sure I won't want to buy later.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This solution is actually very good, because it:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;puts the rate at which I buy things under my conscious control independently of the impulse to buy things (a thing I learned the value of from years with &lt;a href="http://beeminder.com/"&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gives a direct and (almost) equally satisfying replacement for the impulse activity by pressing a different and equally accessible button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fights the digital rot that lists normally have for me by coupling it to a regularly scheduled activity that I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to do because I get rewarded with a book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition I think it will significantly increase the quality of the books I do buy, because each book I buy will be a measured choice between alternatives where invest some effort in ensuring that my book this week will be a good one. I don't intend to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;avoid all error&lt;/a&gt; and I of course &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html"&gt;can't ensure I always pick the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; one&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm pretty sure that investing about twenty minutes of thought into the question will result in me improving on impulse decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Initial Notes Towards a Manifesto&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mechanical Monk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1258738843630678016"&gt;invited his mutuals to write a manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. This is my response to that, though given that this is a notebook it's a more modest attempt to gesture in the direction of what a manifesto would look like when I'm a bit more ready for it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So what do I want? How do I want to change the world?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well I'd like to be able to claim some high minded ideal like universal love and cosmic oneness but that's not what I'm about. What I'm about is this: Dear humanity, we are &lt;em&gt;fucking this up&lt;/em&gt;, and it's annoying me and I'm embarrassed to be a part of it. I really shouldn't be the one to have to tell people how to sort their shit out because I'm terrible at this but apparently nobody else is going to do it right, so &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What do I mean by this?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I mean that we are universally lacking in the basic systems, skills, and ethics, of being functioning, healthy, happy, human beings, and we need to fix that, and instead we are making it worse. We do not have a society that supports the development of those, and in many ways &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;we actively punish their acquisition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An incomplete list of things we are bad at include thinking, feeling, moving, communicating, decision making, organisation, and helping each other out more broadly. Some of us are good enough at some of these things, but essentially nobody is at what I would like to consider the bare minimum standard for all of them (I sure as hell am not!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Currently I think we have roughly the following models for acquiring these skills:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dumb luck and/or privilege in having the right role models (unreliable).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;School (monstrously bad at this, not really designed to do it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Therapy and coaching (limited scope, expensive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weird borderline cults (tend to overfocus on an aspect of the problem and convince you it solves everything. Also, are cults)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-help books (similar problems to cults, also mostly very bad)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these are grossly inadequate to the task.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I'm trying to push back on it. I cannot, at present, fix society and reshape it into a more pleasing image (though if you &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; me to do that and can hand me the keys I uh have one or two ideas), but I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; provide people with tools that may help them under the current circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm acquiring the parts of these skills that I can figure out for myself, or with help, and I'm trying to be a model of how I think this should work. I'm helping other people around me take steps towards the same same, by writing about it, and by building relationships that support each other's growth.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this &lt;em&gt;isn't going to work&lt;/em&gt;. You cannot rely on me to teach you all the skills you need for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The notebook is pretty good, and I hope to do better writing about this in future, but the really high value work is in personal relationships, and there's only one of me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My work is intrinsically built around my particular strengths and weaknesses - I'm a weird, queer, hyperverbal, nerd and so the problems I'm solving and the tools I'm using are designed with that in mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am, as alluded to, &lt;em&gt;not very good at this&lt;/em&gt;, and I'm going to miss things, get things wrong, or communicate them in unhelpful ways, and we need many different voices doing the same sorts of things if we are to have any chance of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-28-06:45.html"&gt;climbing out of the crab bucket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(2) doesn't mean that you can't benefit from my writing if you're not like me, but it does mean that my tools are built in a very particular way for a very particular set of problems. They might or might not work for you (possibly with modification), but even if they work for you they might not solve all your problems because they're designed to solve &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; problems (and, to a lesser extent, the problems of people I know well enough to help). You need to build your own tools too! And then, once you have, I want you to share them with other people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I want you to share them with other people while &lt;em&gt;understanding that their tools might not work for others&lt;/em&gt;.
When I wrote &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-08-10:06.html"&gt;yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; I very clearly spelled out why this was a good solution for me, and that these might not be the same for you. All tools will be like this, but right now people tend to get very evangelical about how their tool is the one size fits all to all problems, and this is extremely wrong, both factually and morally.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm losing steam on writing more of this right now, so I'm going to just end with a list of things I want people to do:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut people some slack. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-06-15:20.html"&gt;Create&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; for those around you. Sign non-aggression pacts in the goddamn &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-06-04-09:58.html"&gt;legibility war&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Treat the problems in your life as interesting and worth solving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Join and learn from &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html"&gt;nerd&lt;/a&gt; communities who can help you solve them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html"&gt;growth relationships&lt;/a&gt;, where everyone involved helps everyone else be better versions of themselves. I'm particularly a fan of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html"&gt;the support group model&lt;/a&gt;, but this is one of those tools that might not work for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/"&gt;Explain&lt;/a&gt; these things to others. Obviously I'm a fan of the notebook blog format, but again that might not be what works for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I understand that what I am asking of you is difficult, and I understand that for some of you it may not yet be possible, but I'm trying my best to make it possible, and easy, for as many people as I can, and I hope that some of you will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to be a better person</title>
    <updated>2020-05-10T12:24:24+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;How to be a better person&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-10&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In response to my &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html"&gt;Initial notes towards a manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joxn"&gt;@joXn&lt;/a&gt; quite reasonably asked how I would avoid falling afoul of the problem that, contra The Good Place, learning ethics doesn't actually make one more ethical. Eric Schwitzgebel has a lot of great research on this (see &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/"&gt;his publications&lt;/a&gt; and in particular the section "The Relationship Between Moral Reflection and Moral Behavior").&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of these, I think &lt;a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm"&gt;Aiming for Moral Mediocrity&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most important:
Schwitzgebel argues that most people probably aim to be about as moral as their peers, and that this is mediocre (neither great, nor terrible) to do, but that most people could manage to be better than they are with no great hardship.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think Schwitzgebel's claim is basically right, and the paper is a very good one, with two major caveats:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is underestimating the hardship, because (I think) he is missing one of the reasons why this happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He has fallen afoul of precisely the reason why learning ethics does not make you a better person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there are approximately four reasons why people fail to behave ethically:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do not care to do the right thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are discouraged from doing the right thing by external factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do not know what the right thing is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They do not know how to do the right thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Behaving ethically is a skillful practice, and most people are either not very good at the skill, not very motivated to practice it, or do not have an environment that enables them to practice it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ethicists primarily study what the right thing to do is, but I think for most people this is not the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html"&gt;constraint&lt;/a&gt; on the skillful practice of ethics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I will, for the purpose of this post, assume that people &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; to do the right thing. I think fixing that is a whole different question. This leaves the other three. Given that we know from Schwitzgebel's work that knowing the right thing to do is also not enough, lets assume for the moment that you, in most practical circumstances if not necessarily in general, know what the right thing to do is. Why don't you do it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, lets take a look at Schwitzgebel's theme of Moral Mediocrity: Why do people aim to be morally mediocre?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I propose that there's a very straightforward reason: Moral Mediocrity is the option that won't get you punished.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you behave badly, people will be judgemental towards you. But they will also react badly to you if you are especially moral. It's not just that you're not a saint it's that, in actual practice, we don't &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; saints, because they make us feel bad about ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the examples in the paper is vegetarianism. Suppose you were reasonably convinced that, ethically speaking, you should be a vegetarian or vegan. Now, all your interactions with people around you around food come with extra friction. Even if you never say anything judgy about it, it's impossible for people to not know you're vegetarian (if they're sharing meals with you) and many of them will respond defensively or aggressively about it. You'll experience a constant, albeit low grade, pressure of the people around you trying to drag you back down to their moral level.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You'll see this with other things too: Someone who is unusually ethical will constantly have people telling them to relax, take things less seriously, etc. Being unusually ethical is weird, and triggers the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;social obligation to be bad at things&lt;/a&gt; in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is not, I hasten to add, a moral justification for being morally mediocre. It doesn't change what you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do. If anything, the tendency of people to norm their behaviour to those around them creates a stronger moral obligation to be good, because it influences others to be good. It is a &lt;em&gt;practical barrier to ethical behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, and any theory of ethics that does not teach you to overcome such practical barriers will not result in more ethical behaviour any more than a detailed understanding of thermodynamics will allow you to build an internal combustion engine. A theory of ethics is all very well, but you need a &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt; of ethics, which is what Schwitzgebel's paper (along with most theory of ethics) misses: Telling people to behave a particular way tends not to work unless you tell them &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to behave that way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's another practical barrier: If you realise that you are behaving badly, and decide to be better, you have to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html"&gt;reconcile yourself to the fact that you could always have been better&lt;/a&gt;, which is very painful, so you would much rather rationalise your behaviour as just fine the way it is to avoid that pain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And for another, consider the following scenario: Suppose you decide to be vegetarian, and you're really good about it for about a month, virtuously resisting the temptation to eat meat, and absolutely hating how bland all your food has become because you don't know how to cook interesting vegetarian food and the cafeteria where you mostly eat has awful vegetarian food. After about a month, you go out for a meal with some friends, and you look at the incredibly disappointing vegetarian menu and your eyes are drawn to the cheesburger selection... and after that you're no longer vegetarian.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This actually demonstrates &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; problems: Firstly, you don't know how to be vegetarian, and are trying to overcome that limitation with pure willpower rather than treating it as a practical problem you need to solve, and the second is that you don't understand behaviour change so you tried to go all in on the new behaviour and then gave up as soon as you failed once.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These are the three main practical barriers to overcome: Social norms, emotional difficulties, and missing skills, and all of these are emimently solvable problems that you can learn to overcome, and that you will find personally beneficial to learn to overcome regardless of whether you use them to become more ethical.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More, I think once you have acquired these skills, you will naturally become more ethical (or at least, more in line with your own values): If you can change when you feel like you should, and you feel like you should behave a particular way, then you'll just do that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So this is my answer to how I'm intending to avoid this problem: I don't plan to try to persuade anyone of the rightness of a particular position, I'm just doing my best to convey some fragments of useful prosocial skills, and trusting that as you get better at those skills you'll become a better person automatically.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mostly, at least. You'll probably still be bad occasionally. That's OK. It's more fun to be a bit evil from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building and Rebuilding Foundational Skills</title>
    <updated>2020-05-11T12:01:22+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Building and Rebuilding Foundational Skills&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-05-11&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a problem: I'm kinda OK at statistics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why is this a problem? Being kinda OK seems... kinda OK, right?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, it would be, but the problem isn't that I have an intermediate level of statistical skill. The problem is that I have a broad range of statistical skill, all of which I'm kinda OK at. I'm kinda OK at elementary statistics, and I'm kinda OK at advanced statistics too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a real problem for learning more, because it is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; to relearn basics because they feel too basic for my skill level.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have another problem: Climbing is a fun sport that makes a good social activity and works on a number of strength skills that I would like to work on. Also I give myself a back injury 100% of the time I do it, because my ability to climb is much greater than my skill at climbing, because I'm hypermobile and have a decent strength to body weight ratio, and the result is that despite some things feeling easy, I do them badly and this results in me inadvertently harming myself while doing them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these share a common theme: It is possible for something to be easy while still being bad at it, and this is especially true with foundational skills, where you've built capabilities on top of them, and going back and relearning the basics is hard and boring.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to get good at statistics, I'd need to grind a bunch of exercises that I frankly feel are beneath me.
I'm probably going to try (despite my &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-03-09:09.html"&gt;complicated feelings about mathematics&lt;/a&gt;) because being good at statistics is important for me professionally and spiritually, and I'll never get good at it until I sort out the basics, and also being bad at those basics risks me tripping up in stupid ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to get good at climbing, I'd need to very carefully (and probably with supervision) try far easier routes than I can manage, and stop far sooner than it seems like I can. I'd have to deliberately hold myself back until I was much better at the basics than I am, despite my ability to do more. I don't value climbing enough at present to do this, so I probably will just avoid climbing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is is why I'm currently restarting the first week of Couch to 5K despite having completed it relatively easily.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's another problem: I obviously breathe badly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm not fully sold on the Buteyko method, which encourages you to breathe less and entirely through your nose, but I obviously mouth breathe at night based on my sleep quality and dry mouth in the morning, and my peak flow numbers aren't great. I'd like to work on this to the point where I breathe through my nose unconsciously and easily, even while sleeping. It probably won't change my life in the way that the Buteyko method promises (though it sure would be nice if it did!), but at the very least it might improve my sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Breathing is definitely a foundational skill, and it's one I'm bad at, so I'd like to work on it, and working on breathing is &lt;em&gt;deathly&lt;/em&gt; boring.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is where I link in three previous tools:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can nose breathe just fine while at rest. I can complete couch to 5k week one (consistent of eight repetitions of a 60 second run followed by a 90 second walk) just fine. What I absolutely cannot do is complete Couch to 5K week one while nasal breathing. I can just about manage the first run and then I am &lt;em&gt;wrecked&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is the way to rebuild foundations, and one of the core reasons why &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html"&gt;learning a different skill&lt;/a&gt; is often essential for progressing at your current goal: By transferring to a different context where the foundational skill is no longer easy, it becomes a thing that you can now actively work at. Working on a foundation in its existing context is often too easy to be possible, so &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:12.html"&gt;the way to work on it is to make it harder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was in fact, already considering restarting week one of Couch to 5K, for two other reasons, both of which are also about foundational skills.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As well as breathing, I'm also bad at walking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes, I'm aware that these are both ridiculous things to be bad at. I think a lot of you reading this are probably bad at them too though. As I said, we have &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html"&gt;a widespread lack of the basic skills of being a human being&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Specifically, I have quite flat feet and weak arches, and a bunch of (probably) related joint pain. I've tried wearing arch support shoes and my considered opinion is that it was an expensive waste of time. (Well, it was a good &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A slightly less fringe (but still fringe) opinion is that the solution to this is actually to have &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; arch support, and to wear barefoot shoes that are designed to protect your feet without supporting them,
because this causes you to actually develop your muscles rather than weaken them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This seems worth a shot, and I was noticing that my ankles were already starting to hurt a bit as a result of week one. I don't want to end up in the situation like with climbing where my ability to do a run exceeds my ability to do a run without injuring myself, so this too seems like a thing I could reasonably make harder in order to work on the foundational skills of.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even without these foundations of breathing and walking, I was still thinking it might be worth repeating Couch to 5K, because I disagree with some of its philosophical premises.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Couch to 5K is designed to ramp up the difficulty level by making you run more, and more consistently. I personally think it ramps up the difficulty too quickly. I basically agree with Sarah Perry's point in &lt;a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/03/body-pleasure/"&gt;Body Pleasure&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[...] people enjoy exercise up to a certain level of intensity, which varies for each person. Most people who do low-intensity exercise feel better during the mild exertion. At the point when the body can no longer maintain levels of oxygen and (separately) lactate in the muscles, the exercise becomes so intense that basic affect (feeling good or feeling bad, the lowest-level evaluation of anything) plummets. Everybody feels terrible when they exercise too hard. Once people rest for a few minutes, they start feeling good again. However, this may not be enough such that people evaluate the entire experience as pleasurable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most on-ramps to exercise are at an intensity too high for previously-sedentary people to find them pleasurable. If people go to a fitness class, or focus on running a particular distance at a particular speed, they’ll likely miss the pleasure zone entirely. Refocusing on exercising only for one’s own individual pleasure, as slowly as one prefers, and only at intensities that are pleasurable, is more likely to motivate repeat and habitual exercising. At that point, the enjoyment of exercise pleasure can build on itself, motivating longer and longer intervals of experiencing the pleasure. I summarize Ekkekakis et al.’s result as: “learn to exercise out of extreme selfish laziness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was a little skeptical about doing Couch to 5K because one of the things I'm trying to work on at the moment is to enjoy exercise, and honestly I don't enjoy running. I'd already been vaguely considering restarting week one so that I could get to the point where it was pleasurable rather than merely endurable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I liked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1258846038552489984"&gt;David Laing's point the other day&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advice on how to get better at a given thing should often be replaced with advice on how to take more pleasure in doing that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasure doesn't lead directly to learning, but it leads to &lt;em&gt;volume&lt;/em&gt;, which leads to learning. Also pleasure is an end in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know exactly how to create pleasure in a thing, but I suspect fluidity is a huge part of it. There is something intrinsically pleasurable about being good enough at something hard that you can do it automatically and reliably, and I think fluidity is extremely helpful for being able to play with a skill.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I suspect this points to a general reason why we are so often bad at foundations: We treat the point at which we should progress as to when we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do the thing, when in fact we should be progressing when it's &lt;em&gt;pleasurable&lt;/em&gt; to do it (or at least fluid where pleasure is impossible). This ties in to the idea that you are not good at doing a thing until you are able to do it reliably rather than able to do it at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you progress as soon as you clear some minimum bar of being &lt;em&gt;able&lt;/em&gt; to do it, then what happens is that the skill will get progressively more and more frustrating as you move up it until you hit some "natural" limit where your frustration exceeds your willingness to progress, and you can no longer easily go back and work on the foundations, so you conclude that you're now as good as you're goign to get.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For reasons, I was reading about &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem"&gt;Bloom's 2 sigma problem&lt;/a&gt; recently, which is often used as evidence for the superiority of private tutoring over general classes, but I found the description of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning"&gt;mastery learning&lt;/a&gt;, which is the specific system being compared, especially interesting:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In comparison, I think most of our school based learning techniques are like Couch to 5K: They assume that there is some straightforward time frame on which you can expect people to progress, and you should progress as long as you can just about manage the previous level, and failure to progress is a sign of significant failure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How much of the 2 sigma system is about the benefits of individual instruction, and how much of it is just about giving people the time to build their foundations before progressing?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This all fits in well to the framework of the &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/"&gt;Fully General System for Learning to Do Hard Things&lt;/a&gt;, but I think I have previously neglected something important: It's not at all obvious what &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; mean in this context. I suspect the threshold for progression should be set much higher than I previously would have set it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Couch to 5K fits pretty well into the Fully General System, in that it repeatedly takes something that you can do (Week N) and makes it slightly harder (Week N + 1), eventually culminating in being able to do a half hour run. It seems pretty good, for a lot of people, in that it gets them to do something that would previously have seemed unattainable, but I'm no longer convinced that either it or the Fully General System are good enough for that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this notion of foundational skills, and the question of mastery progression, point to a common flaw in Couch to 5K and the Fully General System: They are overly narrowly focused on the goal, and don't care about what possible future progress they burn along the way to getting there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I'm still going to try to do hard things, and I'm still going to complete Couch to 5K, but in doing so my aims are not merely to do a half hour run but to do a half hour run while breathing entirely through my nose, wearing barefoot shoes, and enjoying it, and all the while paying attention to the process and using it to learn more about progression and skill development in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Why are things hard?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've recently started a &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/coming-soon"&gt;Substack Newsletter&lt;/a&gt; called "How to do hard things", based on &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/"&gt;my unexpectedly popular post of the same name&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There will be a lot of overlap between the newsletter and this notebook. I'm not quite sure how I'm going to use it yet, but I'm expecting there will be a bit of a back and forth, with the newsletter being a place I use to collect and develop themes I've written about here, which will in turn spark more notebook posts here. If you're enjoying the notebook, I'd also recommend subscribing to the substack. For now at least, you don't need to sign up for a paid tier - the content is the same for all subscribers, but with the discussion / community features turned on for paid ones.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this has got me thinking about The Fully General System For Learning To Do Hard Things. I still think it's a good framework, but I think it's missing a lot of important features - some of which only require additions to it, some of which might require some modifications.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the principle problems with it is, I think, the fact that what it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; is extremely under defined. What is a "hard thing"? And how does one learn to do it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The principle assumption in the post is that things are hard because you lack the skill to do them effortlessly. It's true, some things are like that. But that's a relatively tiny fraction of the ways in which things can be hard, and most things that are hard in one way are hard in multiple, not necessarily easily distinguishable, ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Fully General System as previously described really only admits three possible reasons why things might be hard:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might not know how to do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might know how to do them but not be able to execute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might not know exactly what it is you're trying to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there are quite a few other ways in which things can be hard.
Here is a partial list:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack some simple trick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be &lt;em&gt;wrong&lt;/em&gt; about what it is you're trying to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack resources that you need to do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack motivation to do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might find the whole subject of doing them aversive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There might be some &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-11-14:47.html"&gt;trivial irritation&lt;/a&gt; preventing you from doing the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack a foundational skill that they need but that isn't obvious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be doing something foundational very badly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack awareness of or access to the expertise you need to learn how to do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might need someone to help you do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be rusty at the relevant skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone else might be trying to stop you doing them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The thing you are trying to do might have unacceptable consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There might be social norms making it hard to do the thing in the easy way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It might not be worth doing the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Additionally there are a whole bunch of general reasons why doing &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; might be hard for you:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might not have enough time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have a distracting environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might not be getting enough sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might be depressed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have other mental health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might have physical health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack more general skills around learning and habit formation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might lack more general skills around debugging why things are hard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, most hard things are some mix of multiple of these things, and usually not a small number of them, and any truly general system for learning to do hard things must take this into account.&lt;/p&gt;
