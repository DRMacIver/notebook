&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;A brief introduction to mathematics with one example many times&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-24&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a story repeated so often that it’s a cliche of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss"&gt;Gauss&lt;/a&gt;’s
mathematics teacher setting the class the task of adding up the numbers
1 to 100, supposedly to waste their time and give them a break, only for
Gauss to almost immediately give the correct answer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think it’s a usefully illustrative example to look at for learning
some of the basics of mathematics. Partly this is because it illustrates
one of the key uses and methods of mathematics: Getting an answer that
you could in theory work out laboriously much faster through logical
deducation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mostly, though, I’m going to use it to showcase a bunch of different
ways of thinking through a mathematical problem, and use it to teach
some common mathematical notation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, let’s figure out how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first thing we need to figure out is to how to write it down.
Here are two obvious ways:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16
+ 17 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25 + 26 + 27 + 28 + 29 + 30 +
31 + 32 + 33 + 34 + 35 + 36 + 37 + 38 + 39 + 40 + 41 + 42 + 43 + 44 + 45
+ 46 + 47 + 48 + 49 + 50 + 51 + 52 + 53 + 54 + 55 + 56 + 57 + 58 + 59 +
60 + 61 + 62 + 63 + 64 + 65 + 66 + 67 + 68 + 69 + 70 + 71 + 72 + 73 + 74
+ 75 + 76 + 77 + 78 + 79 + 80 + 81 + 82 + 83 + 84 + 85 + 86 + 87 + 88 +
89 + 90 + 91 + 92 + 93 + 94 + 95 + 96 + 97 + 98 + 99 + 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Neither of these are actually very good.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the first lessons of doing mathematics: A lot of mathematics
is about developing good notation for representing the problem. The
problem with the first, plain English, one is that it’s hard to
manipulate. We want to be able to do algebra with it, and it’s hard to
do algebra with plain English language. Modern mathematics owes a lot to
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Recorde"&gt;Robert
Recorde&lt;/a&gt; for giving us the equals sign (and popularising the plus and
minus signs), because trying to manipulate sums with plain English
language is an absolute pain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second one is bad for two main reasons:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s very clunky and unwieldy. If you’re going to be repeating the
expression a lot, you don’t want to write that out over and over again.
Also, are you sure you’re reading it correctly? Would you have noticed
if I’d dropped 31 from the middle, or repeated 23 twice?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t generalise well. Suppose we wanted instead to add up all
the numbers from 1 to 50, or 1 to 1000, we’d have to write an entirely
new expression for it. There’s no way to do algebra where the end point
is variable with this expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So let me give you two other ways to write it:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1 + \ldots + 100\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{100}
i\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the first, the &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\ldots\)&lt;/span&gt; just
means “and so on”. You’re expected to figure out what it means from
context, but you’re also expected not to write it unless it’s obvious
from context what you mean. If we’d wanted to make it a bit more obvious
we could have written it &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1 + 2 + \ldots + 99
+ 100\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is a much more precise notation and looks completely
inscrutable when you first encounter it, but has a fairly
straightforward meaning: The &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\)&lt;/span&gt;
represents a sum of an expression, where the expression references a
variable &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; that varies over some
range. The &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i = 1\)&lt;/span&gt; at the bottom
indicates that the sum is over a range of values of &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; starting with &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and the &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(100\)&lt;/span&gt; at the top indicates that &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(100\)&lt;/span&gt; is the last element. The &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; to the right means that the expression
we are summing is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, for example, &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^3 i
= 1 + 2 + 3\)&lt;/span&gt;, or &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i =
2}^3 i^2 = 2^2 + 3^2\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\)&lt;/span&gt; notation is very
convenient because it allows us to compactly represent complicated
expressions. It’s also useful for making generalisations. e.g. if we
wanted to work out the answer to this for any number, we could write
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n i\)&lt;/span&gt; to indicate
that the end point is an arbitrary integer &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;There are some implicit notational conventions here by
the way. &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; is usually an index
variable. &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(i\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; are both expected to be integers by
that choice. This isn’t required, but it’s conventional. However, you
would only ever use integers as sum indexed or bounds like this, and
that’s not conventional, it doesn’t really make sense to use
non-integers here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To start with though, we’ll keep working with the &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\ldots\)&lt;/span&gt; notation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can write &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1 + \ldots + 100\)&lt;/span&gt; as
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\((1 + \ldots 50) + (51 + \ldots
100)\)&lt;/span&gt;, because we can break up the sum however we like.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Technically speaking we are using what’s called the
associativity rule of addition here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can also reverse a sum if we want, so we could write the second
one equally well as &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(100 + \ldots +
51\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, there are exactly 50 elements in each sum, so we can pair them
up and rearrange the sum as follows. &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\((1 +
100) + (2 + 99) + \ldots + (49 + 52) + (50 + 51)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Now, notice
that each of these terms adds up to exactly 101. You can check that
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1 + 100 = 101, 2 + 99 = 101\)&lt;/span&gt; etc but
you can also this because each time you move right, you add one to the
first term and subtract one from the second, so the value stays
constant. This means that this sum is exactly 50 copies of 101, so the
sum is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(50 \times 101 = 5050\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think a pretty reasonable question for you to ask at this point is
how on earth you’re expected to come up with a trick like that. If
you’ve seen this problem before it’s old hat, but if you had to come up
with it on the spot, how would you do that?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The honest answer is I don’t know. A lot of things like this you just
figure out by fiddling with the problem and getting an instinct for what
works. This sort of approach is what I think of as a “trick”, and
sometimes you spot the trick which lets you massively simplify the
problem, and sometimes you don’t. As you do more mathematics, you
develop both a familiar bag of tricks, and you learn to apply them in
new circumstances. The trick here is something like “try grouping
different parts of the sum together to see if they add up to something
convenient”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, here’s another way you could use a similar trick.
Suppose I asked you to calculate &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1 - 2 + 3 -
4 + \ldots + 99 - 100\)&lt;/span&gt; (you could also write this as &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{100} (-1)^{i - 1} i\)&lt;/span&gt;
) - that is, it’s the same sum as before, but this time the signs
alternate between positive and negative.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, here you could group it as follows: &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\((1 - 2) + (3 - 4) + \ldots + (99 - 100)\)&lt;/span&gt;.
Each of those expressions in brackets is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(-1\)&lt;/span&gt;, because each time the number on the
right is exactly one more than the number on the left. As before we have
exactly 50 elements, so the result is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\((-1)
\times 50 = -50\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is basically the same trick, but with a different grouping.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mathematics doesn’t necessarily rely on knowing and spotting things
like this, but it’s a very common part of mathematical practice.
Sometimes they’re essential and you can’t figure out any other way to
solve the problem without some sort of trick like this, but often
they’re just a way of bypassing some tedious calculation or another.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, one problem with the way we solved this is that it doesn’t
generalise all that well. For example, suppose I asked you to add up all
the numbers between &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(101\)&lt;/span&gt;, how would you do it?&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Well you’d add 101 to 5050 and get 5151 of course,
because you just worked out the sum from 1 to 100. But suppose you
&lt;em&gt;hadn’t&lt;/em&gt; done that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The previous trick doesn’t work because it relied on there being an
even number of values in the sum. If we tried to do the same thing as
before we’d have to break the sum up as something like &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\((1 + \ldots + 50) + 51 + (52 + \ldots
101)\)&lt;/span&gt;, because there’s a number left over in the middle. We can
then do the same pairing as before and get &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\((1 + 101) + (2 + 100) + \ldots + (50 +
52)\)&lt;/span&gt; for the paired sums, and the result is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(51 + 102 \times 50 = 51 + 5100 = 5151\)&lt;/span&gt;.
Which is, conveniently, &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(5050 + 101\)&lt;/span&gt;,
so we’ve not messed up the calculation somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This works but is unsatisfying. In particular, let’s try to work it
out for a general number &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;. In
order to do this as above, we’ll have to consider two special cases:
First, let’s assume that &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; is an
even number. Let’s say &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n = 2m\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then we can write &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1 + \ldots n = (1 +
\ldots m) + ((m + 1) + \ldots n)\)&lt;/span&gt; as before, and use the same
pairing trick to get &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\((1 + n) + (2 + (n - 1))
+ \ldots (m + (m + 1))\)&lt;/span&gt;. As before, each of these individual
bracketed expressions are always equal to &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n
+ 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and we have &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; copies
of the expression, so the answer is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(m (n +
1) = \frac{n (n + 1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; (because &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(m
= \frac{n}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, suppose &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; is odd. We could
repeat the pairing trick, but we can also use &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1 + \ldots + n = (1 + \ldots + (n - 1)) +
n\)&lt;/span&gt;, and if &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; is odd then
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n - 1\)&lt;/span&gt; is even, so we can use the
previous expression for the sum when &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; is even, plugging in &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n - 1\)&lt;/span&gt; in place of the &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;. This gives us &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{(n - 1)(n + 1 - 1)}{2} = \frac{(n -
1)n}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; for the sum up to &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n -
1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and thus &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{(n - 1)n}{2} +
n\)&lt;/span&gt; for the whole sum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s make that expression a bit nicer. &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{(n - 1)n}{2} + n = \frac{n^2 - n + 2n}{2}  =
\frac{n^2 + n}{2} = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something worth noting here is that although we had to handle the odd
and even cases differently, we got the same expression out in both
cases. This should make us a little suspicious that we’re missing
something and that there’s a nicer proof here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another thing that should make us suspicious but that is actually
fine is that the answer to this question should be an integer, as we’ve
only added up integers, but we’ve got a fraction in the answer. It’s
worth doing a sanity check that this is fine, but it is: Exactly one of
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n
+ 1\)&lt;/span&gt; must be even (because if you add one to an even number you
get an odd number, and vice versa), so the expression on top is always
even, and dividing it by two gets you an even number.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;It’s very easy to make mistakes in mathematics, so it’s
good to have a habit of doing little cross checks like this where you
look at the answer you came up with and ask if it could possibly be
correct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there’s another trick, and that fraction is a clue. We made
this work by pairing up numbers together, and there’s a 2 in the end, so
perhaps we would find it easier to work out twice the answer than we do
to work out the answer directly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can write&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\[\begin{align*}
2 \times (1 + \ldots + n) &amp;amp; = (1 + \ldots + n) + (1 + \ldots + n) \\
&amp;amp; = (1 + \ldots + n) + (n + \ldots + 1) \\
&amp;amp; = (n + 1) + \ldots + (1 + n) \\
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This gives us &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; copies of &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n + 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, so twice the answer is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n (n + 1))\)&lt;/span&gt; and the answer is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; as desired. This is a
much neater proof, but I think a slightly harder trick to spot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is a good time to write some Greek.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We can write &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i =
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n (n + 1 - i)\)&lt;/span&gt;. This is basically “running
the sum backwards” like we did above. The first element is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n + 1 - 1 = n\)&lt;/span&gt;, then &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n + 1 - 2 = n - 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, etc. all the way to
the end where it’s &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n + 1 - n =
1\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This means that &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(2 \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n
i  = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i = \sum\limits_{i
= 1}^n i + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n (n + 1 - i)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, because these sums are over the same range, we can group the
expressions inside them together, so &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(2
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i + (n + 1 - i) =
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n (n + 1) = n (n + 1)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you’re unused to dense mathematical notation this may not seem
obviously clearer or better than the above, but it has the advantage of
being compact and easy to manipulate, and it lets you result a lot of
complex reasoning to fairly simple mechanical manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So now we’ve seen how to work out this answer. But why is it
true?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is another key feature of doing mathematics:&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I wrote about this in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-22-16:32.html"&gt;algebra
and insight&lt;/a&gt; but that example only works if you’re already a
moderately advanced mathematician.&lt;/span&gt;
Often you should be unsatisfied with mere answers, and looking at the
problem from another angle will help you really understand it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is this particular example worth really understanding? Well… probably
not. I think if you find yourself doing a lot of this sort of sums&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Applications include “being a mathematician in the early
to mid 20th century”, “taking a maths exam”, “for the sheer joy of it”,
and “if you do a really large amount of mathematics every now and then
you will run into a case where you really do have a use for this and you
will be so delighted that you’ll ignore how rusty you’ve got at it”.
Also probably combinatorics or something like that.&lt;/span&gt;, it’s worth playing around with a
lot of simple examples like this in order to get a really good intuition
for how everything fits together.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But right now it’s worth really understanding this because it’s a
nice illustrative example of the general mathematical phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Imagine, or draw&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I really should include a diagram here but I can’t be
bothered, sorry. If you’re wondering how to draw &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; boxes, the answer is you don’t you draw
some fixed small number and assume that it generalises. This is why I
don’t like visual proofs that much.&lt;/span&gt; the numbers as rows of blocks
stacked on top of each other. On the bottom row you’ve got &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; numbers, then &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n - 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and so on, until you’ve got &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; block on the final row. The result is a
sort of ragged triangle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, take a copy of that, and flip it upside down, and stack it on
top of the other one. The jagged edges will line up, and you’ll get a
rectangle. How big is the rectangle? Well, it’s got &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; items on the base, because that was
your bottom row, and it’s &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n + 1\)&lt;/span&gt;
tall, because your triangle is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;
tall and you had to stack an extra row on top. So there are &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n(n + 1)\)&lt;/span&gt; blocks in the rectangle, of
which exactly half must have come from our original triangle, so there
were &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; blocks in
the original triangle, and &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1 + \ldots + n =
\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; as desired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, in some sense, the same proof as we had before, but the
geometrical representation of it seems helpful for people, and for more
complicated examples it can be genuinely very useful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is, I promise, one final&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;For the purpose of this post I mean. There are
infinitely many ways to do this, and at least several of the other ones
are interesting in their own right.&lt;/span&gt; way to do it, which is
also often useful: We take a guess, and prove that that guess was
correct. For example, suppose that we guessed the answer was &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. How might we prove
that we were right?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The answer is to use something called “proof by induction”&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn9"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn9" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Any philosophers reading this, don’t panic! It’s a
completely different meaning of the word “induction” that has nothing to
do with the philosophical notion of induction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The way a proof by induction of some claim (your “induction
property”) works is that you establish:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt; (or anywhere
else you want to start - your “base case”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it’s true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n - 1\)&lt;/span&gt; then
it’s true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this is sufficient to prove that it’s true for every integer
greater than or equal to your base case.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why? Well, because of a proof by contradiction. A proof by
contradiction is when you assume something that you’re not sure is true,
work through the consequences, and conclude something false, which means
your original assumption must be false.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To see that proof by induction works, assume the opposite: Suppose
there were some &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; for which the
induction property were false. Then there must be some &lt;em&gt;smallest&lt;/em&gt;
such &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; for which the property is
false. If so, then the property must be true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n - 1\)&lt;/span&gt;, as the property holds for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;, so we must have &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n &amp;gt; 1\)&lt;/span&gt; so &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n
- 1\)&lt;/span&gt; is still an integer greater than or equal to &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and it’s smaller than &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;, which we picked to be the smallest
integer for which the property is false. But the second part of our
induction conditions was that it’s true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n - 1\)&lt;/span&gt; then it’s true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;, which contradicts our claim that it
was false for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, proof by induction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our inductive property is that &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i = \frac{n(n +
1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. This is true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1\)&lt;/span&gt;, you can just check that by calculating
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{2}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose it’s true for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n - 1\)&lt;/span&gt;.
That is, &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i =
\frac{(n - 1)n}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Then&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn10"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn10" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is in fact the same calculation we did in the
even/odd case above.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\[
\begin{align*}
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i &amp;amp; = n + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n - 1} i \\
&amp;amp; = n + \frac{n(n -1)}{2} \\
&amp;amp; = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\
\end{align*}
\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So the property holds for &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt; as
well, and the result is proved by induction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This does, of course, invite the question of how on earth we would
have made this guess if we didn’t already know the answer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there are roughly three ways that can come about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is that you can just look at the first couple elements of
the sequence and try to puzzle out a formula that works. &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, \ldots\)&lt;/span&gt; seems plausible
that there should be a factor of &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;
in there, so what happens if we divide by &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;? We get &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(1,
\frac{3}{2}, 2, \frac{5}{2}, 3, \ldots\)&lt;/span&gt;, so that looks like it’s
going up by half each time, so &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{n +
1}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;, and that gives us our guess.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second is that sometimes you just have a hunch. I think it would
be weird to have a hunch in this case and not be able to spot the better
proof, but in other cases it will often be the case. This is
particularly true when think it’s true because of some sort of
“heuristic argument” that doesn’t actually work rigorously, but does
give you a pretty good idea of what the answer should be.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn11"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn11" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is particularly common when you’re trying to show
something a bit weaker than strict equality, such as e.g. that some
quantity never gets too large.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third common way is that you proved it another way first, but
that proof was long and complicated or involved some advanced concepts
you don’t want to introduce here, so you “guessed” in the sense that you
already knew the right answer, but it was easier to prove it by
induction than convince the reader of it another way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;OK, that’s enough adding numbers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What should you take away from this post?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first thing I’d like you to take away from it is a certain
familiarity with the notation. Being able to read this sort of notation
is entirely essential if you’re to read any mathematics at all.
Mathematics is built on notation, and the notation I’ve used here is
very common.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another thing I’d like you to take away from this is that there are
many ways to get the answer &lt;em&gt;and they all get the same answer&lt;/em&gt;.
There isn’t a single right way to do it, and there can’t be. Mathematics
is a discipline built on solving problems, and if there were always a
single correct way to do it, every problem would be trivial. Doing
mathematics is about developing facility with mathematical problems, and
getting a sense of how to solve them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another is that figuring out which mathematical tool to use is a
skilled practice like any other - through repeated encounters with
mathematics you develop intuitions about what works and what to try.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Reading other people’s mathematics is a good way to start with this
but importantly the proof that people show you is often not the proof
they used to come up with the idea. This means that often when reading
someone’s proof you will have some reaction like “Oh, that’s clever, but
I have no idea how you’d come up with that.” or “What the fuck is going
on here? I have no intuition for any of this”. If you’re lucky you can
just ask them how they came up with it, but if not then I think it’s
worth trying to prove it yourself by figuring out how all the different
pieces fit together and see how you’d do it for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One reason these multiple avenues of proof are important is that
mathematics is not &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a discipline of problem solving, it’s a
discipline of concept formation, and one of the things that drives
concepts is developing a certain aesthetic sense and desire for
intuition around the problems you solve. Many concepts are discovered
because you look at a proof and go “I don’t like that proof. Can I do
better?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Introducing a parameter to work out sums</title>
    <updated>2025-04-25T15:47:04+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Introducing a parameter to work out sums&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-25&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-24-10:00.html"&gt;my
last post&lt;/a&gt; I talked about the problem of working out &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i\)&lt;/span&gt;. In it, I
strongly implied that there wasn’t a way to just work out the
answer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn’t actually true. There’s a quite straightforward way to just
work out the answer. It still requires a little bit of spotting the
trick, but the tricks in question are more like puzzle pieces that you
have to fit together than genuine insights.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, it requires a bunch more calculus than I wanted to assume in
my last post, so I left it out. If you do know the calculus it might be
informative though.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The idea is this: Rather than work out &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i\)&lt;/span&gt;, we work out
&lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(f_n(x) = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i
x^i\)&lt;/span&gt;, and then evaluate &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(f(1)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This will, weirdly, turn out to be easier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How do we do this? Like so:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\[\begin{align*}
f_n(x) &amp;amp; = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i x^i \\
&amp;amp; = x \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i x^{i - 1} \\
&amp;amp; = x \frac{d}{dx} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n x^i \\
&amp;amp; = x \frac{d}{dx} \frac{x^{n + 1} - 1}{x - 1} \\
&amp;amp; = x \left(\frac{(n + 1)x^n}{x - 1} - \frac{x^{n + 1} - 1}{(x -
1)^2} \right) \\
&amp;amp; = x \left(\frac{(n + 1)x^n(x - 1) - x^{n + 1} + 1}{(x - 1)^2}
\right) \\
&amp;amp; = x \left(\frac{(n + 1)x^{n + 1} - (n + 1)x^n - x^{n + 1} + 1}{(x
- 1)^2} \right) \\
&amp;amp; = x \left(\frac{nx^{n + 1} - (n + 1)x^n + 1}{(x - 1)^2} \right) \\
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We want to evaluate &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(f_n(1)\)&lt;/span&gt;, but
this would require us to divide 0 by 0, so we have to take limits. We
can do this with two applications of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule"&gt;L’Hôpital’s
rule&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\lim_{x \to 1} x \frac{nx^{n + 1} - (n + 1)x^n + 1}{(x - 1)^2}
&amp;amp;=  \lim_{x \to 1} x \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{n (n + 1) x^n - (n + 1) n
x^{n - 1}}{2(x - 1)} \\
&amp;amp; =  \frac{n (n + 1) n x^{n - 1} - (n + 1) n (n - 1) x^{n - 2}}{2}
\\
&amp;amp; = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{n (n + 1)  x^{n - 2} (n x - n + 1)}{2} \\
&amp;amp; = \frac{n (n + 1)}{2} \\
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which is the desired result.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, I think it would be reasonable to consider this approach to be
in almost every way worse than the last one. I don’t disagree. That was
a whole bunch of symbol shuffling from which you cannot, I think, derive
much insight about the nature of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But, on the other hand, I think it’s worth realising that sometimes
that’s good actually. Sometimes you don’t really need the insight, or
can’t find it, and you just want to shut up and calculate. This sort of
tool is very useful to have handy for that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, suppose you wanted to calculate &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n i^2\)&lt;/span&gt; instead. Our
previous methods don’t help us here because there are no nice sums to
rearrange. But with this technique it’s actually quite straightforward
(if, admittedly, ugly).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, let’s make use of our previously solved problem to simplify
this slightly. We’re actually going to calculate &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i=1}^n i(i - 1)\)&lt;/span&gt;. We can then
just add an extra &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{n(n +
1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; to the result to get our desired sum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, let &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(g(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n i(i -
1) x^{i - 2}\)&lt;/span&gt;. This is now the second derivative of &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n x^i\)&lt;/span&gt;, which we can
work out&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I asked Wolfram Alpha, because I was lazy, but you could
do this by hand through the application of the usual rules for
calculating derivatives if you can be bothered. I mostly didn’t because
writing it up in my notebook software is a pain.&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{x^n (n^2 (x - 1)^2 - n x^2 + n + 2 x) - 2
x)}{(x - 1)^3 x}\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Taking three derivatives with L’Hôpital’s rule&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Wolfram alpha again. Sorry.&lt;/span&gt; we
get:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\[\begin{align*}
g(1) &amp;amp;= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^n (n^2 (x - 1)^2 - n x^2 + n + 2 x) -
2 x)}{((x - 1)^3 x)}\\
&amp;amp;= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{ (n - 1) n (n + 1) x^(n - 3) (n^2 (x - 1)^2
+ 2 n (x^2 - 1) + 2 x)}{6(4x - 3)} \\
&amp;amp; = \frac{ (n - 1) n (n + 1) (2)}{6} \\
&amp;amp; = \frac{ (n - 1) n (n + 1) }{3} \\
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This means that our desired result is&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\[\begin{align*}
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i^2 &amp;amp; =  \frac{(n - 1) n (n + 1) }{3} +
\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\
&amp;amp; = \frac{2 (n - 1) n (n + 1)  + 3 n(n + 1) }{6} \\
&amp;amp; = \frac{n (n + 1) ( 2n - 2  + 3)}{6} \\
&amp;amp; = \frac{n (n + 1) ( 2n + 1)}{6} \\
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Conveniently, because I really didn’t want to track down
the error if I made one.&lt;/span&gt; the correct answer, as you can
verify by checking the first couple results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now… Do you ever need to be able to do this? Honestly, not really. I
get the impression that this used to be a much more important skill, and
these days you can mostly use symbolic algebra packages to do it for
you, and also you mostly don’t need it anyway, but mathematicians used
to get very excited about this sort of formula, and I think they’re
still important in a bunch of places. e.g. I bet people who do
combinatorics care much more about being able to do calculations like
this than I do, because you often reduce counting problems to this sort
of calculation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Personally, I like it at least partly for its illustrative value.
It’s sometimes very helpful to know that you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; solve a
problem if you were just willing to shut up, sit down, and do the
algebra. There’s also a satisfying sudoku-like quality to do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s also interesting having this sort of skillset at all because I
get the feeling that basically nobody learns it any more. I learned it
because I read “Schaum’s Outlines of Advanced Calculus” at a formative
age, and it taught me all sorts of tricks like this, but it meant I went
into university with this whole bag of tricks that nobody else had. They
weren’t &lt;em&gt;useful&lt;/em&gt; tricks to have exactly, but they were
interesting, and I do feel like it shaped how I look at mathematics a
fair bit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More ways to work out sums</title>

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;More ways to work out sums&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sorry, still on different ways to calculate the sum of the first n
integers. I’ll get bored eventually.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My last post &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-25-13:33.html"&gt;Introducing
a parameter to work out sums&lt;/a&gt; was originally called “Using generating
functions to work out sums”, but the things I was using in it weren’t
generating functions, and doing it with a generating function ends up
&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; nicer, in a way that is obvious in retrospect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The generating function of a series &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(a_n\)&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{n \geq 0} a_n x^n\)&lt;/span&gt;. Often you
can work out the generating function then take its power series
expansion to calculuate jhe original series.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\[\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;amp;= \sum\limits_{n &amp;gt;= 0} \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n i x^n \\
&amp;amp;= \sum\limits_{i &amp;gt;= 1} \sum\limits_{n \geq i} i x^n \\
&amp;amp;= \sum\limits_{i &amp;gt;= 1} i \sum\limits_{n \geq i} x^n \\
&amp;amp;= \sum\limits_{i &amp;gt;= 1} \frac{i x^i}{1 - x} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{x}{1-x} \sum\limits_{i &amp;gt;= 1} i x^{i - 1}\\
&amp;amp;= \frac{x}{1-x} \frac{d}{dx} \sum\limits_{i &amp;gt;= 1} x^i \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{x}{1-x} \frac{d}{dx} \sum\limits_{i &amp;gt;= 0} x^i \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{x}{1-x} \frac{d}{dx} \frac{1}{1 - x} \\
&amp;amp;= \frac{x}{(1-x)^3} \\
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Rearranging order of sums like this is a fairly standard trick for
working out doubly infinite sums. It’s technically justified whenever
the sums absolutely converge.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, to get the power series, we just need to work out the kth
derivative of &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{1}{(1 - x)^3}\)&lt;/span&gt;.
This is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\frac{3 (3 + 1) \ldots (3 + k -
1)}{(1 - x)^{3 + k}} = \frac{(k + 2)!}{(1 - x)^{3+k}}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;You can prove this with induction if you like. This is a
good example of the sort of thing that induction is useful for, where
you spot the pattern and just want to go “and so on”. But you can also
just go “and so on” if you feel like it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, plugging in &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(x = 0\)&lt;/span&gt; to get the
derivates at 0 we get&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="math display"&gt;\[\begin{align*}
f(x) &amp;amp;= \frac{x}{(1-x)^3} \\
&amp;amp;= x \sum\limits_{n \geq 0} \frac{(n + 2)!}{2 n!} x^n \\
&amp;amp;= \sum\limits_{n \geq 0} \frac{(n + 1)(n + 2}{2} x^{n + 1} \\
&amp;amp;= \sum\limits_{n \geq 1} \frac{n (n + 1)}{2} x^{n + 1} \\
\end{align*}\]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Giving us, once again, the desired result.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You could use a basically similar argument to calculate &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{n \geq k} n (n - 1) \ldots (n -
k)\)&lt;/span&gt;, and from that work out &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum
i^k\)&lt;/span&gt; for any &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;, but I can’t
be bothered at present.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to not salami slice this topic over too many more posts,
here’s another proof I spotted yesterday, which uses a standard
combinatorial trick of counting the same thing two different ways:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Consider all distinct pairs of numbers drawn from &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\{1, \ldots, n + 1\}\)&lt;/span&gt;. Counted one way,
this is just &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\({{n + 1}\choose 2} = \frac{n (n
+ 1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, count it another way: If the smaller number in the pair is &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(k\)&lt;/span&gt;, then there are exactly &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n + 1 - k\)&lt;/span&gt; choices for the larger number.
Therefore there are &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{k=1}^n (n +
1 - k) = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^n k\)&lt;/span&gt; choices in total, so &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{k = 1}^n k = \frac{n (n +
1)}{2}\)&lt;/span&gt; as desired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As an additional note, one thing I’ve been noticing when working
these out is just how much better pen&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I know, I know, a true mathematician would use a
pencil.&lt;/span&gt; and paper is for working
these out than trying to type them up on the computer is. Part of this
is that my notebook doesn’t have the best affordances around LaTeX, but
I think a lot of it is genuine ease. Mathematics really still feels like
it’s best done by hand to me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think that if I were using an actual interactive theorem prover, or
even just a symbolic algebra library in Python, or the like that might
stop being the case, but writing LaTeX feels too obviously like a
presentation tool, not a tool for actually working things out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Speaking from the heart&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;“Focusing” is the name for a basic therapy skill coined by Eugene
Gendlin.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The story goes&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I believe that this story is apocryphal and Gendlin
already knew the conclusion he wanted to reach and then used this as a
sort of post hoc justification for it. But it seems both plausible to me
that this is what you observe and also I think the method works, so it’s
a useful illustration regardless.&lt;/span&gt; that Gendlin and his students wanted
to figure out what caused some people to improve in therapy and others
not, so they looked at transcripts of lots of therapy patients and
analysed them for what made the difference. Eventually they realised
that the biggest impact was not from anything the therapists did, but
whether the patients said “Um” a lot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The explanation for this observation is this: If you’re speaking
effortlessly and fluently about your experiences, &lt;em&gt;you probably
aren’t paying attention to how you’re feeling&lt;/em&gt;, and in particular
you’re not checking in with whether what you’re saying actually feels
like. If you imagine someone saying “Yup everything is absolutely great,
I’m doing fine” while their face calls them a liar, that’s the sort of
thing I’m talking about. Frequently people will do this not because
they’re lying, but because they don’t even notice that they’re not
telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When progress happens, they instead say “Yup everything is absolutely
great, I’m doing fine. Um. Except…” and then start talking about the
actually important thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Gendlin describes the process of realising what you said wasn’t true
and noticing the feeling you get about it as paying attention to it as
noticing the &lt;em&gt;felt sense&lt;/em&gt; of the problem. This example comes from
an exercise he suggests somewhere&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This might have been in his book, Focusing, but I think
I remember this as a suggestion from a friend reporting on Gendlin, so
it might also be something else.&lt;/span&gt; is to say out loud
“Everything in my life is completely fine.”, notice how that feels, and
then start saying “Except…” until you run out of things to list.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway this is the core of Focusing as I’ve understood it to date:
It’s a fundamentally corrective process, where you say things, then you
find out the ways in which they’re not true, and you use the felt sense
to correct them. I’m pretty good at this part.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Thus granting me a good grade in therapy, a thing that
is both normal to want and possible to achieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there’s another part to it that I’ve never been very good at,
which is where you let the felt sense “speak directly”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One problem with the speaking first and correcting it is that
thoughts are fast and feelings are slow, and it’s very easy for whatever
part of you that is feeling the thing to get overwhelmed, even when
you’re trying your best to be helpful. I was trying to explain this to
Lisa the other day and the analogy I used was imagine talking to a shy
child who isn’t very good at speaking yet. Even if you correctly
anticipate what it’s trying to say to you, the mere act of anticipating
it can make it less willing to talk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What you (or at least I) have to do instead is say some words,
slowly, and then if it’s not actually clear to you what the next words
to come out be that would feel right are… pause, and wait for them to
come. Sit there, just letting there be a long gap in your sentence,
until the next words come out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The frustrating thing about this is that it works much much better if
there’s someone listening, and that someone has to sit patiently with
you and wait. This is hard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I mentioned I was explaining this to Lisa the other day. This was a
very good conversation in which I was trying to express some things I
was feeling sad about, and part of it lead to a very good meta
conversation about how to have such conversations. One thing that came
up is that Lisa and I have very different internal experiences when
we’re clearly struggling with words, and that in the ones that Lisa has
and thus was expecting I was also having, trying to help complete the
other party’s sentences is actually very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there are roughly three things I experience that lead to this
sort of halting speech:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This thing of waiting for a felt sense to express itself
properly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Tip of my tongue” style aphasia where I know the word but I’m
struggling to find it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Situations where I know what I want to say but feel paralysed from
saying it, out of fear or similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the second two, completing a sentence correctly is quite useful.
It either tells you there’s nothing to be afraid of because they already
know what you’re going to say, or it gets you out of the aphasia.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I actually don’t like it when people help me out when
I’m having aphasia, but that’s a different and much less important
issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even in the classic “corrective” sense of Focusing, where you’re
trying to express a sentence that feels true, completing the sentence is
quite helpful, because it gives you something concrete to check
against.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But… when trying to express myself around something deeply felt and
poorly understood, I think completing the sentence doesn’t help even
when the completion is right, because much of the point is not just to
say the true thing, but to experience the feeling fully, and if you skip
to the end you don’t get to do that, and the whole process is left
incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result though is that you need patience when talking to someone
doing this, even when that someone is yourself. It’s very easy to return
to the lightning quick world of words and race ahead, but sometimes you
just have to sit with the feeling until it’s ready to talk.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Motivation gradients&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-28&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s a type of depression that I’ve written about before where it
feels like a restriction of the possible. You want to do normal things,
but doing them feels completely impossible, even when in a more literal
sense it’s perfectly possible to do them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there’s another type where everything just feels sortof flat.
It’s not actually difficult to do things - there’s not much internal
resistance per se, but there’s also no ability to orient. The feeling is
not “I can’t do things”, but “I can do things, but why would I do this
thing in particular?”. When presented with any particular choice of
writing topic, the bit where interest or disinterest would be responds
as a sort of emptiness. It’s not an unwillingness to do the thing, it’s
more like a total directionless neutrality on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway this is what I’m feeling about writing right at this minute,
so I’m just writing down the phenomenology of what I’m currently
experiencing, because that seems like a good default.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things is that I’d lost my pad of writing
ideas.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Bad labelling and organisation on my part got it mixed
in with a bunch of other identical pads of paper and I couldn’t find
which one was it.&lt;/span&gt; I initially thought this might be
the source of the problem, so I tried to generate some more ideas, and I
didn’t actually find it very hard to generate a new list of ideas. Many
of them are ones that I abstractly recognise would be good to write
about, but I look at them and try to imagine writing about them right
now the answer is still that empty sort of why.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is heat, honestly. It’s about 25C in my
office right now, which isn’t scorching, but that’s after significant
attempts at heat management, and I think part of what’s happening is
that my brain and body are going into a sleepy heat crash.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One perhaps telling indication of this is that as soon as I thought
of that and started thinking about steps to take to reduce heat in this
room it became very easy to take actions for that.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Mostly I bought fittings so I can get out my proper AC
unit and install it somewhere useful, and I filled up and turned on the
swamp cooler I have in my room.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The weird thing is that I don’t feel particularly hot. I feel…
lethargic maybe, but I’m not getting any strong signals about
temperature, just behavioural responses to it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things I pointed out in &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/labelling-feelings"&gt;labelling
feelings&lt;/a&gt; is that you’re allowed to figure out what you’re feeling
based on observing your own actions like you would for anyone else.
Something I hadn’t noticed before is that when trying to figure out what
you want, you can partially infer this by finding things that are
unusually easy for you to do right now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think a lot of the time this will end up in unendorsed actions,
like doomscrolling, but I think if you cast around and explore the space
of alternatives maybe you’ll find there are some unexpected things in
there that are much easier to do than expected because how easily you
respond to the idea of doing something towards them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where are your limits?</title>
    <updated>2025-04-29T21:03:56+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Where are your limits?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-29&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A recurring theme recently has been doing things because they need to
doing, regardless of whether you currently feel like doing them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve got some pushback on this, especially on using &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html"&gt;this
daily writing habit&lt;/a&gt; as an example, particularly around how “need” is
fake.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it’s true. Need is in some sense fake. You can always skip the
dishes and let them pile up in a festering heap, rendering your kitchen
ever more difficult to use. &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/using-what-youre-given"&gt;You can
always let the apples rot&lt;/a&gt;. There’s very little you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to
do in the sense that it is a logical necessity that you must do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, there are a lot of things that you should, on
balance, choose to do, and being able to bind your future self to that
path, and to be beholden by the commitments of your past self, is often
going to go far better for you than not doing it. I might not want to do
the dishes now, but future me would much rather that present me had, and
even present me will probably feel better for doing it once I get over
the initial hump. Being useful feels better than not being useful, most
of the time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But do I need to keep writing every day? Probably not. The biggest
problem I had writing today was when figuring out what to write about
was &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-28-18:49.html"&gt;once
again&lt;/a&gt; asking myself the question: Well, what am I writing for? If I
don’t really know why I’m writing, it doesn’t really matter what I write
about.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This continues to be a &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/i/60442550/which-way-should-i-go"&gt;singularly
unhelpful&lt;/a&gt; answer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In some sense, the reason why I’m writing is that I am writing is
because writing every day is a good way to discover interesting things
and articulate things you otherwise wouldn’t have articulated. This is a
true and important reason and is a key part of why my past self decided
to do it. But right now I don’t feel like I care about that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason I am writing is because I’ve decided that I write every
day. Eventually that will stop being enough, but right now it still
is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I think there’s a question of… OK, past you has decided that
you’re going to do a thing, or present you believes that you need to do
a thing. When are they wrong?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of my failure modes is that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-02-12:34.html"&gt;I’m
not good enough at asking for help&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the ways this shows
up is that if I’ve decided that I need to do a thing, I will usually do
the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of this is that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-19-10:53.html"&gt;depression
is a bias towards inaction&lt;/a&gt;, and doing more than you feel like you
can helps drag your way out of depression. So I legitimately don’t trust
the feeling that something is too hard or too much, and I will generally
feel better for doing it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;…except when I don’t. Because sometimes it’s actually a bad idea for
me to do the thing, and I should make an exception.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I made an exception for daily writing over Easter weekend and that
felt like the right thing to do.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I’m actually not sure that it was! I do feel like I’ve
taken a significant hit to the habit since returning. But on balance it
was still probably correct.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I have to be chased out of the kitchen because I’m clearly
wobbling when I try to stand up and someone else should do the dishes.
Sometimes everyone’s in this state and we have to admit that OK the
dishes &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be done tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The question, I think, is when you should make these sorts of
exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jml.io/galahad-principle/"&gt;The Galahad Principle&lt;/a&gt;
says you shouldn’t make any exceptions! But I think that we can weasel
our way out of them by saying that the thing we’re committing to 100% on
is no &lt;em&gt;unprincipled&lt;/em&gt; exceptions. Act only according to exceptions
that you would be willing to universalise. That is, if you made an
exception in every case like this, would that be OK?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don’t think this is quite sufficient though. Sometimes you
experience genuine changes. If I were to lose my ability to type for
whatever reason,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Which would be very bad for dayjob reasons.&lt;/span&gt; I’d probably stop the daily writing,
and that seems legitimate but also does call into question the
“necessity” of doing it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I think as well as the ability to make exceptions you need to find
out where your limits are, and learn what to do about them. It’s not
always to accept them. Sometimes you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2024-01-07-08:50.html"&gt;need
to work harder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But sometimes you need to acknowledge that the part of you that was
saying that this was too hard was right, and actually decide that some
things don’t need doing and change your commitments accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not today though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Heavy up front learning requirements</title>
    <updated>2025-04-30T19:59:16+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Heavy up front learning requirements&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, Dave and I went to Cambridge recently to visit Dani Clode at the
neuroplasticity lab. She developed a device called &lt;a href="https://www.daniclodedesign.com/thethirdthumb"&gt;the third
thumb&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty much what it sounds like - it’s an extra
thumb you can attach to your hand on the opposite side of your normal
thumb.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="/images/third-thumb.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s designed specifically as an augmentation, not a prosthesis,
which I thought was an interesting choice. The difference is essentially
that it’s not designed to exactly mimic a biological thumb, but instead
has a couple of adjustments that are there to help you use it in ways
that you wouldn’t normally use a thumb. e.g. they’ve got an example of
essentially wrapping the thumb around a bottle while you twist the cap
on and off with your hand.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things that was interesting about it was that it was just
very hard to use.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;For me. Dave found it very natural&lt;/span&gt; I was starting to get the hang of it
by the end, but I was just constantly dropping things or holding them in
weird ways that didn’t make much sense and often didn’t even actually
use the third thumb. Some of that is just that it’s foot controlled,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;You get two degrees of freedom. One with your left foot
to move the thumb up and down, and one with your right foot which you
use to grip.&lt;/span&gt; vnd I don’t have very good foot
control, but I think a lot of it’s just that it is genuinely quite
unintuitive. Dani told us that they’ve got a week-long training course
that they run with these to show people how to use them, and people
usually have the hang of it by the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I thought that was pretty interesting in its own right, because
it’s fairly rare that I encounter a new sort of device that requires
this much training to use. Implicitly, you do have that much training in
how to use a keyboard or how to use a mouse but particularly with the
keyboard example, there’s an easy onboarding route, you can always hunt
and peck, right? It’s not that you need a huge amount of training in
order to be able to use the keyboard at all. It’s that there is a
fluency that you acquire through time and practice, but the baseline
level of disfluency is still pretty effective.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third thumb wasn’t like that at all. I was making a complete mess
of things, as early on there is no equivalent to hunt and peck, and my
ability to do things was made strictly worse by using the third thumb.
You have to just have to figure out how to use it before it’s anything
other than in the way. Now, we were not encountering it in the proper
training setting, so this is very much not me saying that the third
thumb is not a usable object, I’m saying that there is an effort
required to onboard to using it it, and this is just an interesting
contrast with most of the devices that we encounter.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Dave and Lisa are currently learning to drive, which seems in some
ways like a good analogy to that, in that there isn’t an easy onboard to
learning to drive. But honestly this is partly because there is a high
safety requirement, and partly because you need to not just know how to
use the car you need to know how to use it in a way that is predictable
to others. You could learn to drive by just messing around in a car and
seeing how that works. There’s nothing that in theory stops you from
doing this, and presumably many early car users did learn to drive this
way - formal licensing of drivers is a much more modern form than the
car itself - but regardless of how artificial the gap is there’s still
this sort of onboarding requirement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the most transformative technology I can think of that’s
happened to me in recent years is still the smartphone.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I know that’s not that recent anymore but I can’t think
of anything as big since. AI isn’t there yet.&lt;/span&gt;
Certainly this is probably the biggest example of augmentation in our
day-to-day lives. But the smartphone is very much not like a third thumb
or a car. It is designed with continuity to the mobile phone from
before, which is designed for continuity with previous devices, and it’s
designed to be easy for kids to pick up,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Too easy if anything.&lt;/span&gt; and
is generally a fairly gentle onboarding process. Although your use of it
will improve with practice, you don’t really have to spend a whole bunch
of time sitting down with your smartphone and trying to figure out how
to use it before it’s useful, instead it starts useful and becomes more
useful over time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it seems to me like there’s this split of how much effort you
have to invest in before you know how to use a particular type of
technology. It’s not exactly shallow vs steep learning curves, so much
as it’s about time to first usefulness. There can be a lot of depth to
learning a new technology, but if it’s rewarding from early on then it
will be a very different experience from something with a high up front
cost, and I feel like we’ve gotten very used to the idea that everything
should be more like the smartphone than the third thumb.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This does on some level make sense of course. In some sense it’s
clearly better to have this than not, right? It’s much more rewarding to
immediately be able to use a thing and work from there to improve it
than it is to have to invest a whole bunch of effort into something that
isn’t useful until you spend that effort.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;In that it turns learning it into an &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-12-16:30.html"&gt;anytime
project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,
but it seems like there’s limitations to that approach where not all
things &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; work like that, and that up front investment feels
extremely daunting and unwelcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I care about this is that one of the things I like about
the third thumb is that I do have a pervasive sense that the world
should be weirder than it is. I think this is partly just my “where’s my
flying car” instinct. I do have a sort of very science fiction type
attachment to the idea that you can expand human capabilities, and feel
like it’s a shame that we’ve largely not gone down that route and
instead just embraced phones as a shitty ad-supported version of our
cyborg future.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how you would ever make physical augmentation useful
from day one, because it’s such a fundamental change to your way of
being in the world. In sensory augmentation, maybe, something like &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240229152043/http://sensebridge.net/projects/northpaw/order/"&gt;the
North Paw&lt;/a&gt; is a good example. Because it’s just providing you
feedback. You can consciously interpret that feedback and gradually you
internalize it over time. But something like the third thumb or
prehensile tail, I don’t know how well you can possibly make that an
incremental approach, and as a result this attachment to easy learning
experiences feels like a limitation on human progress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve often thought that there just is a lot of sort of missing space
in the range of UIs that we try out. And some of that is many of the
alternatives we tried out just aren’t very good. You can sort of see
this with VR where it turns into, like, turned out to be like a quite
limited paradigm that we still haven’t figured out how to use well. But
I was really interested in the idea of using the Kinect or Leap Motion
as styles of interaction with a computer and doesn’t seem to have turned
out that way, and I don’t think that was just the limitations of the
technology, I think it was the degree to which it required both the
users and the developers to actually learn something new.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I think these sorts of cliffs where you have to do active
training are part of that. I think people have gotten as used to the
idea that UI should be seamless and intuitive as they are used to the
idea that websites should be free and that seems like a shame.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another problem with this is that even things where you don’t have to
invest this sort of trained skill practice into, I bet we would actually
benefit from deliberate practice. I bet actually, if I spent a week
studying how to better use my smartphone and better fit it into my life,
I probably would figure out important and interesting things about how
to use it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think something I notice is that there is a general lack of
deliberate practice for our everyday tools and habits built into life,
and it seems like we are missing something as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Studying specifics</title>
    <updated>2025-05-01T19:34:10+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Studying specifics&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-05-01&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There’s something I deeply believe, and only very erratically manage
to follow through on, which is that there’s a huge amount to be learned
by studying something more than it seemingly warrants. This is in some
sense the core of the post &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/overthinking-overthinking"&gt;Overthinking
overthinking&lt;/a&gt; which is what created the “Overthinking Everything”
name that I now use for my newsletter and community.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One core reason for this is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html"&gt;existence
proofs&lt;/a&gt;. If you put more effort into solving a problem than it really
warrants, you’ve now demonstrated that that problem &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;
solvable, and you can potentially use that solution in other cases,
gradually reducing its effort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this relates to one of my points in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-30-18:50.html"&gt;Heavy
up front learning requirements&lt;/a&gt;, which is that it’s worth spending
some time heavily studying skills you use regularly, even ones that
don’t seem like they need it. Sometimes just by really levelling up one
specific task, you should be able to learn generalisable lessons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is of course… how do you actually do this? How do you
pick what specifics to study?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One part of the answer is to just do which ones bring you joy, but I
think there’s a key problem with this: The specific prescription is to
study something &lt;em&gt;more than it warrants&lt;/em&gt;. If it brings you joy to
study it, hopefully you’re already using that joy to prompt you to spend
more time on it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Right? Right?? Um, OK, this theory might have some
problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You could study everything more than it warrants, but then you
rapidly hit resource constraings. Where are you going to find time for
that?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is, often, the bottleneck on the joy version too: There
are many things that if &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-03-14:16.html"&gt;you
just followed your curiosity&lt;/a&gt; you’d find would bring you joy, but
there are &lt;em&gt;too many things&lt;/em&gt;, and as a result you do none of
them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Instead, a better solution I think is to pick arbitrarily and
capriciously. Perhaps, ideally, at random from those that you think seem
like they would be interesting to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of my recurring fantasy scenarios is what I’d do with an
improbably large amount of money, and one of the regular projects I
think about is just randomly sampling a few hundred people from the
population and giving them near unlimited healthcare - extensive
investigations of anything that’s a problem for them, suitable
interventions (erring on the side of cheap and low risk ones), and then
studying the data from that extensively to learn useable lessons for the
broader population.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This strikes me as the right sort of general tool: By sampling
randomly from the set of places you &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; intervene, you learn
plenty of things that will generalise out of that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don’t yet have a very good idea of how to implement this
though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People often talk about needing to be better at saying no.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is treated as a monolithic skill or general character trait, but
I think this might be another &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-05-30-18:41.html"&gt;victim
of metonymy&lt;/a&gt;, and there are actually a number of very different
circumstances under which you might need to learn this skill. For
example, here are a few:&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Claude helped with some of these, but I deleted about
50% of its suggestions and edited most of the rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to someone who has authority and will legitimately
pressure you to say yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to someone who has authority but does actually want you to
say no if you can’t do the thing but you’re afraid to disappoint
them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to things that you do want to do when you’re too tired to
do them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no when you really don’t want to do a thing but know the
person who would do it instead also doesn’t want to do the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to a friend who consistently asks for favors but rarely
reciprocates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to family members who expect you to participate in
traditions that you no longer feel comfortable in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to a romantic partner who wants to move faster in the
relationship than you’re comfortable with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to a project at work that you could help on but isn’t what
you want to be doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to a child who wants something that isn’t good for them,
despite tears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to participating in gossip or conversations that make you
uncomfortable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to a request that you think is unethicaly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to requests for information that feel inappropriate..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to taking on additional responsibilities when others
aren’t doing their share.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to providing help when you are legitimately the best
person to do it but don’t have the capacity to do so right now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying no to providing help when you are legitimately the best
person to do it when you could do it but really don’t want to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For me, I’m pretty good at saying no in circumstances where I’m
really over capacity, especially if I don’t particularly care about the
asker. I’m also good at saying no even when there’s a power
gradient.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;However, I’m &lt;em&gt;very bad&lt;/em&gt; at saying no to doing something when
someone I care about would have to do it instead and also clearly
doesn’t want to do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In some sense, I endorse being bad at that, you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do
things for people you care about, but also that caring is (hopefully)
reciprocated, and you should let them do that for you too, and that’s
the part I’m bad at letting (or encouraging to) happen. Also you’ll
often end up in specific instances where &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html"&gt;someone’s
gotta&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes it’s easier to just do the thing than navigate
who that someone should be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Regardless though, this feels like a much more specific problem to
engage with, for at least two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can look at a specific circumstance and actually engage with the
concrete feelings around it much better than you can a sort of vague
“I’m bad at saying no”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can ask for help on specific circumstances, especially recurring
ones, in a way that you can’t with the general. Rather than “I need to
get better at saying no”, you can start with “I need to ask for help
here”, and it’s a concrete enough problem that help will hopefully be
forthcoming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    <title>The wheel turns</title>
    <updated>2025-05-03T16:49:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;The wheel turns&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-05-03&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please note: This will contain some spoilers for the entire Wheel of
Time series of books and up to the end of Season 3 for the show.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of my earliest memories of reading Proper Fiction are of the
Wheel of Time books by Robert Jordan.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to claim they’re great literature. I’m not even going
to claim they’re &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; literature. I’ve tried rereading them as
an adult and just couldn’t. But as a kid they were definitely doing
something for me, above and beyond their key virtue of being long and
available in airports.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I grew up in Saudi Arabia but came to England multiple
times per year, so my childhood involved a lot of flights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, I’ve read these books a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; over the years.
Certainly every book up to around… let’s say book 8 I think, I’ve read
multiple times. The Fires of Heaven, book 5, I believe I have read no
fewer than four times, but that was because it was the only book I had
with me in a very unpleasant situation, so I read it cover to cover
several times back to back as a form of very literal escapism. I don’t
think I’ve done that with any other book before or since.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, notably, I couldn’t tell you a single thing about what happened
in The Fires of Heaven. I was going to say that this was because it was
one of the books where nothing happened, but &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fires_of_Heaven"&gt;looking it up
on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; I’m not sure that’s true. A bunch of quite notable
things happen in it. Probably the real reason why I don’t remember it
very well is because I read it in 1993 and that was, allegedly, quite
some time ago.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I’m actually a little confused by this chronology
because I don’t see how the events in question could have occurred in
1993, and 1994 seems much more plausible, but I was reading a hardcover
copy of The Fires of Heaven for the first time, which was presumably
around when it came out in 1993. But maybe this was the lag of books
making it over to the UK back when the delays were longer or
something.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I feel like this series was a sufficiently big part of my childhood
that I should have more memories tied up in it, but I don’t really.
Fragments of conversations about it with friends and family as kids come
to mind (including several about how weird Robert Jordan was about
girls), and an early realisation about differences in visualisation
ability from talking to a childhood friend about our respective attempts
to recreate the flame and the void exercise.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I never did manage to figure out how to channel
though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I was pretty excited about the TV show, though I tried to
temper that down to cautiously optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My emotions since have been… mixed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They’ve made a bunch of changes to the books and I think that this is
mostly good. I’m a little irked by some of them - for example, I think
giving Perrin a wife only to fridge her in the first episode in order to
give him a more tragic backstory was extremely Not On. I also felt like
they worked a bit too hard on giving Mat a tragic backstory. And I’m not
sold on the new backstory for Nynaeve either.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, it feels like… they didn’t like how protagonisty Rand
was, and they felt the need to make everyone else have more protagonist
energy in order to make the whole show more of an ensemble show than it
would naturally be (which matches how the books are later, but early on
Rand is definitely The Protagonist), and I’m not sure that really
improved things.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think it especially didn’t improve things for Nynaeve,
who is incredibly well cast and didn’t really need the extra support.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This also shows up in the whole “we don’t know which one of them is
the dragon” thing. I thought it was an interesting conceit, but also it
didn’t work. I particularly think that “We don’t know if the dragon will
be a man or a woman” part really is too big a departure from the books
and ruins a lot of the worldbuilding such as e.g. the role of the Red
Ajah. Some of this is an attempt to update the gender politics of the
books to be less… Robert Jordan… and I generally approve of that, but I
think there’s a tricky balance to be struck there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You could see the discomfort with Rand as protagonist play out
particularly badly in the end of Season 2 where they basically felt the
need to give everyone a participation trophy. The big battle scene at
Falme was… incredibly weak, and lacked any of the drama of the books.
Frankly, I hated the ending of Season 2, and that’s part of why I took
so long to start on Season 3. I’d given them a pass for Season 1 ending
so badly, which was apparently mostly due to COVID, but Season 2 was
them writing a season ending without those problems and the result was…
extremely mediocre.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think one thing this emphasised for me is that I do have a nagging
feeling that the showrunners don’t really understand what was good about
Robert Jordan’s writing. That’s understandable. I don’t really
understand what was good about Robert Jordan’s writing, and I used to
consider myself a big fan, but I think the contrast with the show has
actually helped me understand that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I think one thing that Robert Jordan &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; very good at
was endings. Many or most of his books have big dramatic endings that
have both major plot impact and a real sense of grandeur to them. The
season endings so far… didn’t. The season 3 ending is much better than 1
or 2, but even that it feels like it was a bit lacking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Season 3 makes some pretty dramatic changes from the books,
partly in that it mostly follows book 4 and skips book 3 (presumably to
incorporate it more into season 3), and I think that’s great. I’m
actually a huge fan of most of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the big things that I feel like we’re starting to see is that
they’re pruning plotlines. For example, there’s an entire plotline with
Siuan Sanche post-stilling that got um… quite aggressively pruned, and I
think the series is stronger for it. I think ditching the Choedan Kal
(the giant sa’angreal) is a great choice.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And not just because I think Callandor deserves
better.&lt;/span&gt;
This is I think really good, because one of the big problems Robert
Jordan had as a writer was that he was absolutely incapable of doing
that. Every plotline spawned two more plotlines, and a lot of why the
books turned glacial as he wrote more and more of them was that there
was too much going on for each book.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m not so sure about the change to Nynaeve overcoming her block this
early on,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;In the books, that’s book 7.&lt;/span&gt; but mostly because of the degree it
required Leandrin to be holding the idiot ball to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another change I’m cautiously a fan of is the Aviendha/Elayne
relationship. I actually quite like that one of my formative series as a
kid had… actually reasonably healthy depictions of poly relationships,
even if they were much more along the lines of a very heterosexual
polygamous / harem fantasy,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Though often reverse harem too! I don’t think it’s
literally canon that the green ajah and their warders were often in
relationships, but even if they weren’t literally having sex it’s very
much a poly life partnership.&lt;/span&gt; and I like that that’s
potentially better balanced out in the series.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Although I’m a little concerned that they’re just going
to pair people up and Rand will only end up with one of them. Certainly
it seems like Mat and Min are getting paired up. Rand, Aviendha, and
Elayne, seems like a plausible triad though given the Aiel traditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Season 3 has definitely restored me to my cautious optimism.
I still don’t think that this series is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;, but it’s
starting to manage to be a meaningful improvement on the source
material, which is how I felt it might turn out at the beginning of
Season 1 and didn’t really feel throughout most of Season 2. As a
result, I find myself actually looking forward to Season 4.&lt;/p&gt;
