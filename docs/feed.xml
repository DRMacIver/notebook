&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Being fragmented&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Being human is weird and I don't really get it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This may be surprising to you, or it may not, given I've probably spilled most of a million words writing about it, but really that's how that works. People aren't good at explaining things they understand easily.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But a lot of that is about being a human among other humans. This is, admittedly, what being human is, and you can't really separate the human condition from the experience of other humans, but nevertheless there's something about the basic n=1 human experience that I feel like I don't get some times.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A while ago I asked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1085634803381297152"&gt;if people experienced themselves as their body or their body as something they pilot&lt;/a&gt;. I've gotten better at experiencing my body as me since I asked that (though I'm still not perfect at it by any means), but the thing that's increasingly hard is experiencing my brain as me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sounds bad, maybe it is. It's not that I think my brain is anyone else. All of the bits I have ready access to feel like they're doing fine, but it feels like there's so much going on that I don't have access to, and it's very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can't tell how much this is just me and how much is just the human condition. Sometimes when I don't understand something fundamental like this it's because I'm missing something that other people get, but I think a lot of the time other people are also confused about it when it's pointed out them and just ignore it most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But it feels like there's clearly a lot going on under the surface. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-09-10:00.html"&gt;My relationship with memory is very confusing&lt;/a&gt; and there's clearly a lot going on there that I don't have direct access to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not totally clear to me whether I should &lt;em&gt;expect&lt;/em&gt; to be able to directly access these things. All of it feels a bit mysterious. It may well be like feelings, where you have to essentially use something else to "bridge" the parts of your brain that aren't talking to each other directly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing that sometimes works as bridging is some sort of talk aloud protocol. Writing is, in theory, similar but I think doesn't work as well. Hearing yourself speak and noticing what comes out is often a surprisingly good means of finding out things about yourself. If only it didn't feel so weird to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been experimenting a little bit, on and off, with &lt;a href="https://photographyinsider.info/image-streaming-for-photographers/"&gt;image streaming&lt;/a&gt; as a way to learn visualisation. I've had precisely zero success with this method, precisely because speaking out loud seems to be hard for me in a way that disrupts the process. I've had a little more progress with doing the things they say don't work, just paying attention to vague visual impressions I have while half asleep in bed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My working theory about visualisation is that it's basically a user interface to some sort of underlying capability, and I'm definitely not completely lacking that underlying capability, but it feels like I'm communicating with it in semaphore. e.g. I've got a pretty good spatial memory, and there's definitely &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; I can do that is like mentally walking around in a place that I have lived for a while. Or even just spent a reasonable amount of time. There's even a bit of a somatic component to it - I have an experience as if walking around in the place. I could no more really tell you what I'm doing than I could tell you how I left my hand up. I just do it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I'm obviously not walking around in the space. It's more like the equivalent of an inner monologue - there's no confusing it for sound, and yet it has a sound like quality. This is what I assume (and have somewhat confirmed) visualisation is like for most people too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there's clearly still some of the things that visualisation is supposed to access going on. I can, e.g. describe what someone looks like from memory. It just doesn't go via an imagine appearing in my head. &lt;em&gt;Something&lt;/em&gt; is providing the information, in whatever form, I just don't have access to it as anything other than a black box feeding me information.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, all the capabilities of my mind feel fragmented. Like there are different pieces talking to each other, but large chunks fail to participate in any sort of unitary whole. This isn't plurality - I don't feel like multiple people occupying the same space - it's more like I'm a person with a computer, and some of the capabilities of the human-person computer reside in the computer which the person has to type commands into.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sounds dramatic, but I'm pretty sure some degree of this is normal. Being human is weird, and the more you look at it the weirder it gets, so most people don't look at it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which is fine. It's mostly unproblematic as long as everything is working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But often not everything is working. When tired, or ill, or half-asleep, capabilities stop working or become slow to respond. It feels like it's unsurprising that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html"&gt;I sometimes panic at night&lt;/a&gt; - the capabilities I rely on to function as me are disrupted, and the fragmented nature of thought starts showing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coffee as a way of life</title>
    <updated>2022-01-12T05:18:26+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Coffee as a way of life&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-12&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Right now I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want a coffee, and I shouldn't have one, so I'm compromising with a green tea. But this daily writing is about whatever is on my mind, and apparently coffee is what's on my mind today, so let's talk about coffee.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back in early December I got the flu. It wasn't much fun, and I spent a couple of days basically unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, I took the opportunity to break my caffeine addiction. This made it even less fun, but past a certain intensity it doesn't really matter if it gets a bit worse because I'm basically asleep and full of cocodamol either way.
I had a coffee break scheduled for the week after anyway, so it wasn't bad timing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been a coffee addict for about 20 years at this point - started when I went to university, and have continued ever since.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People look at you funny when you describe it that way. For some reason people don't think that the drug they take every day in order to feel normal is a real addiction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile Pact coffee, who I use(d) for coffee deliveries sent me this email after I started writing this post, and clearly know exactly what they're doing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You took a break from fresh coffee deliveries a while ago. I just wanted to check whether you're stocked up, or it it's time to unpause your plan? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're ready for your next hit of the good stuff, just hit 'Unpause my Plan' below, or you can log in to your Pact Account Page to unpause your Plan whenever you need to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People's responses when you tell them that you're quitting coffee are often absolutely infuriating. "Why would you ever want to quit?" is common - apparently the fact that they literally can't conceive of life without their drug of choice is evidence that it's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a big deal...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Most users also skip their daily drug dose so rarely that it doesn't even occur to them that the withdrawal symptoms are related. My dad has a story about how he used to get these really mysterious headaches every weekend and he couldn't figure out what was up with them, until he eventually realised that maybe the large quantities of strong coffee he drunk at the office might have something to do with it...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The best piece of advice I've given to people talking to me about this is to imagine I'm saying "cigarettes" instead of "coffee" as a sanity check for whether what they're saying is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, quitting coffee is hard, because you end up building your whole day around it. The first priority in the morning is dealing with caffeine withdrawal (if you wake up feeling like shit every morning, sorry that's probably caffeine withdrawal), which drags you out of bed to make coffee. You drink your coffee, and now you need to go to the bathroom (coffee keeps you regular, although how pronounced this effect is depends on the type of coffee). Now you've got lots of energy (although not necessarily the good kind) and can get on with your day. This gradually wanes throughout the course of the day until by night time you've run out of caffeine, feel sleepy, and fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Or at least that's how it is for me. Others differ.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Quitting coffee I have... none of that. This causes all sorts of problems. For example, since quitting I've been &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; struggling to get out of bed in the morning because the cue I've been using has been the caffeine withdrawal, and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html"&gt;my current sleep problems&lt;/a&gt; seem to partly stem from not being sleepy enough at night due to the lack of caffeine withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general it feels like the loss of caffeine has destabilised my entire way of being in the world. I'm much less agitated and fidgetty, which is one of the key reasons why I wanted to quit it, but it turns out I used a lot of that agitated fidgetiness as the basis of getting things done. One of the benefits of the daily writing this month is that it solidly proves to me that I can write without caffeine which is honestly not something I entirely believe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is all of this worth it? Honestly, I don't know. I like not feeling like shit in the morning, and not spending my day either wired, sleepy, or both, is pretty neat. I can read hard nonfiction in the evenings now because my brain hasn't run out of caffeine to fuel it, which is also neat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But sometimes I have really bad days and I desperately want a coffee because I think, often correctly, that it will help. And this isn't ideal because when my caffeine tolerance is low, caffeine is a hell of a drug (it's about 4 hours since I started writing this post as I had some calls in the middle, and I'm still buzzing off that green tea and a little worried that I won't be able to sleep tonight). Caffeine really helps me plaster over variance, and is one of the tools I've used to be &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-10-10:41.html"&gt;slightly more reliable&lt;/a&gt; over the years. Also it's very easy for one bad day to lead to another, especially if the caffeine I used to fix the first disrupts my sleep, and before long I've got a caffeine addiction again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More than this though, it just feels like being a bit of a stranger to myself. There's the version of David that I was on caffeine, and there's the version I am now, and they're not miles away from each other but they're different enough that the whole thing feels disorienting. It feels like a healthier place to start from, but it also feels like I'm having to relearn basic things. Nothing about my day or my emotions works quite like I expect, because there are subtle shifts in how everything works - the rhythms of my day are different, and the mood I bring to tasks is different. It feels like I'm having to relearn a lot of things from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a pretty decent chance I fall off the wagon and go back to being caffeine David. It's not like this is the first time I've tried to quit coffee, and they usually fail - in my most successful attempts I get a couple months in and go "Wait am I just going to be this depressed forever? That sucks." and go back to drinking coffee.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I'd like to stick with it this time. I like different things about caffeinated and decaffeinated David, but the latter seems like a better foundation for deciding who I want to be, even if I have to learn a lot of the basics of being him from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Regrets and interventions</title>
    <updated>2022-01-13T07:22:30+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Regrets and interventions&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-13&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've seen a number of people write letters to their past selves recently. I keep thinking about doing so, but I have questions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mostly I want to know about what model of time travel we're using.
Do I stop existing when my past self receives the letter, or do I create an alternate timeline?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I, by and large, like existing. I'm not sure what to think about continuity of self in general. I'd probably use a teleporter, but time travel based genocide/suicide in order to birth a new world with a different version of me in it seems like a step too far.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't just pedantic quibbling about the question in which I try to avoid what it's &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; asking. The question is important.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You see, a fantasy of sending a letter to your younger self expresses a very straightforward core belief: If you wished the best for the younger version of yourself, you would make sure they never become you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I struggle to regret being me, mostly for the relationships in my life. I'm probably supposed to not regret being me for intrinsic reasons, but eh. I'm fine I guess. I'll admit to liking many of the other versions better. But those versions had different life paths, and met different people, and I'm sure those people are equally fine, but I like mine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But in the scenario where I get to advise young David on his life path, I would definitely offer him plenty of advice, and if he listened to me it would lead to a very different life. Probably many very different lives.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's difficult to look back at nearly 40 years of life and think how much you'd have done differently, and I think a lot of my memory "problems" probably come from avoiding doing that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It feels like I've essentially meandered my way through a long series of choices that seemed like a good idea at the time but, in retrospect, weren't, or needed to be better thought out. As a result the point in life I've ended up in is... fine? But there's plenty of in-retrospect-obvious paths where a letter from future me would probably have been very life improving.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't feel bad over not having taken those paths exactly. Many of these better paths are ones where I wouldn't really have been able to figure them out at the time. Some of them are ones I'm still struggling with. There are past paths that I wish I'd stuck with, but this would have required a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-10-10:41.html"&gt;level of reliability with which I'm still struggling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I'm pretty sure &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; would have been able to figure them out. This is why I have &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-02-12:34.html"&gt;such strong feelings about help&lt;/a&gt;. There was no time travelling letter from my future self that could have fixed things, but there was an entire human civilisation in which I was embedded that seems weirdly indifferent to the growth and well-being of the people within it. Probably the people who could have helped existed, and maybe I could even have had access to them if I had sought them out, but I wouldn't have had the first idea how even if I knew that I needed to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I guess, to a large degree, this is why I write much of what I do. I don't have the ability to send it back in time, but my problems are hardly unique, and maybe if they're in a similar position to me, what I write can substitute for someone else's letter from a future self that they're not getting either.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walls of people</title>
    <updated>2022-01-14T17:54:01+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Walls of people&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-14&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's an idea from Jungian psychology that traits that piss you off more than you would endorse often come from traits you reject in yourself - things that you would, on some level, like to be able to do, but feel like it would be bad or not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't think this is always true, but the overwhelming majority of the time I treat it as true there's an "Ah... fuck." realisation that comes after.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one thing that pisses me off to an irrational degree is people in tube stations who just stand around obliviously in the way, dawdling around uselessly in the most inconvenient places as if they didn't have a moral obligation to be constantly anxiously monitoring their environment and themselves in order to avoid inconveniencing other people. Monsters.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there's nothing to look at there and this is a clear case where Jung was wrong. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I feel similarly about people making too much noise. For example, playing music on your phone speakers while on public transport is, as far as I'm concerned, literally a war crime.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not all of my neuroses are public transport related. I'm also like this about neighbours. A previous neighbour would often deliberately blast loud music into the street out of their flat window, and the lack of subsequent arson charges is a credit to either my self-control or my alibi and I'll never tell you which.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My neighbours are quite loud. Also the sound insulation in this building is garbage, because construction isn't actually designed by people who give a shit about what their flats are like to live in. But definitely the neighbours are also much louder than they should be given that.
Naturally, I resent this bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can't even jokingly pretend I don't know where this one comes from. I'm a fairly quiet person, and some part of me really really doesn't want to be. That part wants to scream, long and loudly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Why scream?", you might reasonably ask. I don't actually know. Anger and frustration are part of it, certainly. Not necessarily at anything in particular (or nothing in particular that I admit to myself), just a lot of that that's built up and been imperfectly dealt with over the years, and the accumulated detritus needs a release.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think that some of it is just that I want to be able to. Some sort of declaration that I'm here, and that I'm allowed to be here, and I'm allowed to take up the space I need.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thing is, I can't. As we've established, no sound insulation. My neighbours will definitely hear me screaming if I do, and no matter how much tolerance you have for your neighbours being inconsiderate with their noise usage, you hear a loud and extended scream you're definitely going to freak out and probably going to call the police. Chances are nothing actually bad will happen to me, but boy would it be a lot of drama.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've thought about going to a park in the middle of the night or something as a place to do this. Throw my head back and scream at &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-09-10:00.html"&gt;the stars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But sound carries pretty well at night, and if you hear someone screaming in the middle of the night in a park you're &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; calling the police.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are practical solutions to this problem and I've already thought of them. If I really wanted to scream, I could go hire a properly sound proofed music practice room somewhere. Maybe some day I'll do that. But this isn't really about solving the screaming problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Being loud is the easiest way to take up space. Loud people fill the room in a way that doesn't leave space for others, and generally I hate them for it. If you want to be heard when there's a loud person around, you have to be loud in turn, and now everyone's life is worse.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But as a result, a desire to be loud is the easiest way to become aware of the walls of people surrounding your life, and how hemmed in you are by them on every side.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People try not to notice each other, but this only works as long as you don't do something too strange. If you break the norms, they definitely notice. The best case is they judge you for it, the worst case is that there are actual consequences. People don't like it when you break ranks, and the mob is not kind.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The truth is it's not as dangerous as all that, and much of this can be solved by caring less, but caring less has never been my strength.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I like cities, I do. There's a lot to recommend them. But the last few years feel like I've been getting all the downsides of living in London and none of the upsides. On top of that, it's difficult to feel safe leaving on public transport, so there's a deeply claustrophobic feeling of being trapped here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been thinking of getting a car. I'd hoped I'd never need to own a car, but there's a freedom to owning one that it's very hard to replicate with anything else. I'd like to be able to just get in my car and escape London to somewhere that's as close to remote as you get in England.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's nothing wrong with being inside walls, but sometimes you need to go outside.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Being an ideas guy</title>
    <updated>2022-01-15T18:18:11+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Being an ideas guy&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-15&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a complicated relationship with the fact that I am that much maligned creature, an ideas guy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I'm going to use the gendered term "ideas guy" throughout because a) The stereotype of the ideas guy is very much a guy b) We don't have a good gender neutral term as a result and c) I am a guy)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better at ideas than &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-10-10:41.html"&gt;follow through&lt;/a&gt;. My ideal situation is to be in an environment where my main role is to consult on or suggest problems rather than do the legwork of seeing things through to completion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is not a popular archetype. People like me are generally seen as being selfish - wanting to do the fun bits and let other people do the hard work.
It's not entirely unfair. I'm not averse to hard work, but I am averse to &lt;em&gt;sustained&lt;/em&gt; hard work - ideally I'd work hard on a problem until I get bored of it and then hand it over to other people. Sometimes I get bored of things after a couple of days, sometimes they hold my attentionf or months, very rarely they hold my attention for years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I will say in my defence that I've done my time in the hard work mines. My career has been an endless series of looking for places where I get to go do clever researchy things, I then come in and immediately concluded that what they needed wasn't clever research but responsible engineering and then, reluctantly, admitted that yes I could provide them with that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't mind having done that. I think it's very hard to have any good ideas in a space you've not developed a solid foundation in. But I did it for ten years, and burned out, and enough is enough. This sort of thing is not what I'm for - I can do it, because I'm pretty generically competent, but it doesn't make me happy and burns me out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's also a poor use of my abilities, honestly. I am much, much, better at getting other people unstuck than I am at working reliably. As a result, if you add me to a team in this capacity, I probably expand the capacity of the team immensely, but if you add me to the team as one of an interchangeable set of developer roles I still make things better, but I'm just a good developer, nothing very exciting happens. I'm a far better force amplifier for other people than I am a worker on my own.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, I think, a major deficiency in our conception of teamwork. We treat "being a team player" as meaning being part of a homogenous group of people where you're supposed to take on the same responsibilities as everyone else. Sure, maybe you have different skills, but "I'm not able to do that work" is supposed to be the main reason to refuse work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't think this really properly respects the strengths of heterogenous work, or the variation in people's individual abilities.
Certainly it's not reasonable to expect to only get to do the fun work, but it's also not reasonable to to ignore your team's individual strengths and weaknesses when planning, and if someone is able to vastly improve the capabilities of others, it's better to have them doing that.
Some of us are smarter than we are reliable, and trying to "fix" that will generally not result in someone who is both smart and reliable, but someone who is miserable and unmotivated and maybe if you're lucky slightly less unreliable than they otherwise would be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the way out of this is partly to think about what ideas guys are for.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This notion of being a force amplifier for others is not, generally speaking, part of our typical conception of what an ideas guy does, and I think this is because we're confused about a number of things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is that we assign credit too heavily based on who has the idea. The reason the ideas guy is so unpopular is that it's very attractive to people who want credit without doing any work. As a result you get a lot of glory seekers. Most of them also have shit ideas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ideas don't deserve none of the credit, don't get me wrong, but the people who do the work to actually execute on the idea are typically as or more important than the ideas guy that got them started.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another is where we need ideas. I think your classic stereotypical ideas guy just comes up with an idea for a project then delegates it to other people and sits back and relaxes, or goes on to come up with another project to hand off to someone else. This is how you get &lt;a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335"&gt;the Stargate program&lt;/a&gt;. This is a bad use of the ideas guy, because they mostly end up creating work ungrounded in the reality of its execution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been reading a bit about the history of Bell Labs recently, and one of the things that was most interesting about it was the role of AT&amp;amp;T in how effective Bell Labs was. Obviously they were a source of funding, which was important, but more importantly they were a source of &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt;. John Gertner's "The Idea Factory" describes Bell Labs as a &lt;em&gt;problem-rich environment&lt;/em&gt;. You had rooms full of smart people, and their job was mostly to be on call when someone wanted to know how to best place telephone poles or reduce noise on a line.
Bell Labs basically invented the entirety of modern computing (e.g. both the transistor and information theory came out of Bell Labs), but the thing that really made it work was that people there were doing research in response to many mundane and practical concerns.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Conveniently, almost every attempt to execute is a problem-rich environment, and it seems like it would be great to have an ideas guy responding to that - someone who you can go to get help when you're stuck, or who can proactively investigate ways to improve. You can think of this as the servant ideas guy, in analogue with servant leadership.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something like this feels like my ideal role, or perhaps that it used to be.
To a degree this is already &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NyGGU3qDUpvO_7iP66Q8b7L5HjDe6biPiEjau8LJCO0/edit"&gt;what I do with my consulting work&lt;/a&gt;, although that's less embedded in the team than I would like.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think what I want these days is some mix of servant ideas guy and classic ideas guy - I do actually want to have ideas for direction (although I need to get out of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-03-14:16.html"&gt;my current malaise&lt;/a&gt; if I'm to do that), but I need other people around and working with me to properly go in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This doesn't necessarily involve me being "in charge" - it works just as well if a bunch of people get together to mutually agree to work on the same problem - but it also doesn't involve entirely working on other people's problems like consulting or normal employment do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Either way though, it's time to get comfortable with this as a key part of who I am, and what I need to thrive. I suspect many others need this too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Curiosity is a team sport</title>
    <updated>2022-01-16T20:36:10+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Curiosity is a team sport&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-16&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-03-14:16.html"&gt;Relearning curiosity&lt;/a&gt; I talked about the need to talk to others about things I'm interested in. I've been thinking some more about this some more and run into what is, in retrospect, an obvious problem: I don't have the first idea of how to do this, and I think this is because I'm doing something wrong prior to getting to that point.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you about the one time I tried to do research level mathematics. The question I was interested in was this: Given a discontinuous function \(f: X \to \mathbb{R}\), where \(X\) is some topological space, how closely can it be approximated by a continuous function in the uniform norm? There is an "obvious" lower bound of \(\delta(f) = \sup\limits_{x \in X} \inf\limits_{U \ni x} \textrm{diam}(f(U)\), where \(U\) ranges over open sets. Is this lower bound tight?
The answer proves to be yes, if \(X\) is paracompact. Is the converse true? i.e. if \(X\) is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; paracompact, are we guaranteed that this bound is not tight?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It turns out, yes, more or less. This question had all been thoroughly explored by some German mathematician back in the 70s, which took me a while to find out because Google Scholar wasn't really a thing I knew about back then (it did exist, but I'm not sure I knew it existed and certainly I wasn't good at using it - this would have been 2005 or so). I can no longer find the reference, which shows how much I still care about the problem. But at the time it was a neat problem to get my teeth into.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This problem has a couple of characteristics of things that are easily interesting to me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Firstly, the problem statement is relatively accessible. In this case that means it's relatively accessible if you have a certain amount of mathematical knowledge, which I did, but it's not &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; off into the weeds. This will not be obvious to you because I've made no attempt to handhold you into it and also my idea of what counts as accessible is weird, but the point is that I could start tackling the problem immediately.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Secondly, it's pretty niche. Less niche than I thought, clearly, in that it &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have a niche of people who had worked on it a while ago, it's just that it was unfashionable. Also being unfashionable seems a common theme in my interests.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it's not all that useful, and if you asked me why it was interesting I wouldn't be able to give you a good answer (certainly not now, but probably even then). It's just neat, in a way that I can't really articulate or defend. It's within arm's length of practical things (for a pure mathematician's notion of practical), but not itself practical. There's no extrinsic reason to be interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unlike most things I tend to get interested in of that nature, I did have the advantage of having a friend who I could interest in the topic. We worked on it together for a bit until we discovered the prior art and got disappointed. That doens't happen to me much these days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Other things I've been interested in over the years include random voting, test-case reduction, various interesting algorithmic problems, etc. Recently I've been getting into writing Wordle solvers, just for the lulz. There have probably been many others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The crucial feature of all of these is that I noticed something interesting that seemed under-researched, picked it up, and ran with it for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which is to say uh... I appear to be picking my interests in a manner that actively selects for things that other people are not currently interested in, and then being very surprised pikachu when this results in not having people to share my interests.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've tried to get other people interested in these sometimes. If I hadn't flamed out of my PhD, that was ostensibly the point of it - getting other people interested in test-case reduction to the degree that I was. It turns out marketing is hard. Hypothesis was a genuine opportunity to share my interests with people and collaborate on them, but unfortunately I mostly burned out on that by trying to make it do too much for me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can explain my interests to lots of people. &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/"&gt;I'm very good at explaining&lt;/a&gt;. 
But as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-15-17:03.html"&gt;I wrote about yesterday&lt;/a&gt; I'm increasingly feeling like my ideal working environment is working in a team, and I think a lot of the time what I want is not for people to listen to my interests, but to engage with them fully and work with me on them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Back in &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/maintaining-niche-interests"&gt;Maintaining niche interests&lt;/a&gt; I talked about how if you've got niche interests you want to maintain, you probably need a community for that interest, but I think I understated the problem there. I tried to fix my increasingly lackluster level of interest in computer science by forming a computer science community, and that was a good thing for me to do but didn't help, because what it got me was an &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt; for my interests, which falls very far short of partners.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And, well, if that's actually what I want, why the hell am I working on this as an individual and trying to interest people in what I've done after I've already picked something that makes it hard?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Surely, if you want to have interests you share with people, the thing to do is to start with people you want to share interests with, and then work together with them to find and develop those interests?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fulfilling work</title>
    <updated>2022-01-17T10:31:45+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Fulfilling work&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-17&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/23/good-idea/"&gt;almost certainly apocryphal&lt;/a&gt;, but there's a supposed quote by Gandhi that goes as follows:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalist: What do you think of Western civilization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gandhi: I think it would be a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is what I feel about the enobling power of work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a thing I've noticed on and off which is that people who have never worked, in some generalisable sense, are &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;, in a way that I do not intend to be as complimentary as I often do when I describe someone as weird.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't necessarily mean "had a proper job", and there's all sorts of other things that count as "work" in my book here. My central example of someone like this is not someone on unemployment benefits, but a trust fund kid. People who are rich enough that their life hasn't ever really required them to work for things. They may still have had a hard life in other ways, and I'm sure they have myriad &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-15-09:33.html"&gt;nice problems to have&lt;/a&gt;, but there's something that feels very dysfunctional about them - a sort of purposelessness and failure to engage with the actual reality of the world, or their relations with other people, because they have never really had to test themselves against the former and have always had the resources to avoid relying on the latter.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a problem that, to some degree, I can relate to, and feel like I'm struggling with a bit myself. To the degree that I have not fallen into this trap, my history of actually working seems to be a large chunk of the character I rely on to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've not really had a "proper" job for the last 6 years - I've had projects, and I tried doing a PhD, and I've picked up freelance work on and off (which I'm properly taking seriously now so will be more on than it has been), so it's not like I've been idle or had no money coming in, but it's definitely felt more like being a NEET than like being in employment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And there are aspects of employemnt I miss a great deal, even if there are other aspects that I do not miss at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To me it feels like there's some sort of central human experience which has all of the following components:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A group of people, working together on a problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem has an actual (even if small) impact on the world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The problem is difficult and without working hard on it they will fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All (or most) of the people in the group actually care about the problem and want to succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No member of the group could succeed at the problem on their own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each member of the group is an active participant in the process, and the end result depends on how well they fulfill their role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Possibly this list isn't sufficient, but it all seems necessary to be an example of the thing I'm pointing to, which one might as well call something like "fulfilling work".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For me the optimal examples of such things are research and development, but they don't have to be. Renovating a house or working in a garden, for example. Hosting an event to some degree counts (it depends a lot on the event - certainly running something like a conference does. Throwing a party seems to be lacking something, probably the impact aspect).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think many people have roughly zero experiences like this in their life, but their job is the thing that comes closest. Some people even have this in their jobs, although I think it's not the norm.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Certainly, jobs being fulfilling work is not my experience - my jobs have all failed on (4), in that I think roughly nothing I have ever been paid to work on as a software developer has felt like something I cared about for its own sake. Some have reached the heady heights of "Oh yes I guess that might be good to exist", some of them have been intellectually neat problems to work on (which I then reluctantly went and worked on the boring engineering they obviously actually needed rather than the neat problems they hired me for), but none of them have been things I would have considered worth my effort if, well, they weren't paying me a lot of money for it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It was also a bit lacking in (6) - generally the end result wasn't bottlenecked on how well I fulfilled my role because the nature of working at startups is that the thing that will kill you is whether or not the people with power are competent to run a company and choose a product direction. Spoiler: They usually aren't.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It does, however, have all of the other characteristics, to a much larger degree than really anything else in my life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Hypothesis is a close second, but I sortof failed at working on it around the point it was starting to become truly collaborative, for unrelated reasons)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-16-08:40.html"&gt;Yesterday's post&lt;/a&gt; was partly me coming to terms with the fact that hobbies and personal interests &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; don't fill this role, and the other people are a necessary part of it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of discourse that one could handwavily frame as "work vs leisure". Obviously you need both and the strawman versions of both of these positions are idiots, but I feel like the thing that is missing from both the pro and anti work discourse is that the sort of work you need is not just any work but &lt;em&gt;fulfilling&lt;/em&gt; work, and that much of what people experience at work is a cruel caricature of that experience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I do think that we need something of this nature, not just leisure. People create themselves in concern with other people, and test themselves against reality, and this sort of shared project that actually matters is our best tool for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Difficulty finishing things</title>
    <updated>2022-01-18T14:11:39+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Difficulty finishing things&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-18&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a psychological quirk of mine that I've never really got to the bottom of. I've occasionally noticed it in others, and I wonder how common it is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's this: Some part of me clearly rebels at finishing things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't slacking. I do also slack on some things, granted, but that's not what I mean. I mean I do something like 90-99% of the work and then just... stop. I don't want to take the final step and complete it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This shows up across a variety of areas. I'm not quite sure what the common thread is - there needs to be some sense in which it's a "task", but it happens for both enjoyable ones and unenjoyable ones.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A trivial example of this is that often I'll fail to wash up everything. I'll do almost all of it but I'll leave one or two items on the side because I can't be bothered to do those right now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It also shows up on large writing projects - I'm the worst at large writing projects. I know I write a lot, but virtually all my successful writing happens in one sitting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Games, too. There are a number of games I've played something like 90% of the game and then "got bored of". Sometimes this is because the game got too hard towards the end, but I don't think that's all of it. I definitely stopped playing before I plateaued.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've also noticed this in what projects I'm attracted to. I really like problems where it's impossible to solve them optimally and there is always room for improvement. I still stop before the end, of course, but that's now because there is no end. My recent adventures in Wordle solving are an example of this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some things the source of the aversion to finishing is pretty clear: If I finish the project, I have to act on it. If I finish writing a paper, I have to go through the publication process. If I finish a blog post or newsletter issue I've spent ages on, I have to deal with the fact that it might not succeed, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But this doesn't actually feel like a central example of the problem. As I've shown every day this month, it's not that hard for me to publish writing for the public. I do sometimes procrastinate a little on finishing it, but not much.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It feels like this is because the action of writing it is atomic in some way - the writing I do is generally something that is short enough that I can do it in one sitting (although I do often take breaks) and so it's just "one" task. The things that are hard to finish are composite, often done over many sittings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? I honestly don't know. The best I can describe it is that there's a sort of ugh reaction as the finish approaches. It feels a bit like being tired of the task, but as I've noted before, I think tiredness responses like this are often fake.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe this is a difficulty with transitions. The sharp end of a task is something to fear, in a way that a gradual drifting away from it is not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wonder if there's something comforting to a part of me about an unfinished task. As long as there are things to do, I don't have to confront &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-08-08:36.html"&gt;the real choice of what I do next&lt;/a&gt;. I'm always able, in principle, to return to an unfinished task, and that anchors me against having to make broader and scarier choices.
I don't return of course. That would require finishing them, and abandoning the comfort of having something concrete to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't really know if this is it though. There's a sharp and unpleasant feeling to the idea of a completion that I can't really articulate at the moment, and whatever the reason the result is myriad unfinished and half-completed tasks around me at any given time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All I really know is what I said at the beginning: Some part of me rebels at the notion of completing a task. I can feel it even now - it's insisting that I shouldn't publish this piece until I've got to the bottom of why. I shall resist its demands.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The usefulness of things you don't use</title>
    <updated>2022-01-19T17:22:29+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;The usefulness of things you don't use&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-01-19&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Right before writing this post, I took the recycling down to the recycling bins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Wait, sorry, that doesn't quite convey the right significance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Right before writing this post, I took the recycling down to the recycling bins &lt;em&gt;for the first time in a month&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is stupid, I know it's stupid. But I really procrastinate on taking down the recycling a lot. I've tried various systems, and they often work for a time, but basically taking the recycling down is just &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; too annoying. I don't particularly like going down to the basement car park where the bins are in the first place, and then on top of that sorting the recycling into the different bins for it is just quite fiddly. The whole thing takes about 10-15 minutes tops unless I've &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; let it build up (which absolutely happens), and isn't objectively that bad, but inevitably it's always a task that is easier to leave to later than to do now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the thing that got me take the recycling down is that I've implemented a new productivity system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Wait, no, don't go! I promise the bit about the productivity system will be really short.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The new system is actually &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-11:33.html"&gt;an old system&lt;/a&gt; with a twist. The old system is just a simple daily list of things it would be useful for me to do today, which gets shredded without rollover at the end of the day (or, more typically, the beginning of the next day when I remember). I call them day plans. Day plans are very good for me, and I often remember that for weeks at a time and then stop using them. The twist is that I read &lt;a href="https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/01/18/todos-from-paper-systems"&gt;Slime Mold Time Mold's post about TODO systems&lt;/a&gt; earlier and I really liked their point about systems which create pride in your use of them, and the calendar with crossed out days looks perfect, so now I've got a calendar up on my fridge which I cross out days that I've used a day plan. This is day one, so that part isn't really relevant except in the sense that this is the first day I've done a day plan for in months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the interesting thing about taking the recycling down is that the thought process that lead to me taking the recycling down is that I was just coming back from a walk and I had the following sequence of thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While I have my shoes on I should take the recycling down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess I'll add that to the day plan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Or I could just take the recycling down?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So in fact I did this without actually using the day plan system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Does this mean that I didn't need the day plan? No, I don't think so. The day plan was very useful for this, despite not being used for it, because its existence turns the problem of putting off taking the recycling down from one that I can't solve into one that I can. I've talked about such things as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html"&gt;existence proofs&lt;/a&gt; before - they let you conclude that a solution exists, now all you need to do is figure out what a good enough solution looks like.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this case the solution was "just do it", but sometimes you do actually need to figure out an alternative solution. An example of this for me recently is sleeping pills. I've talked about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-04-14:48.html"&gt;my recent problems with sleeping due to anxiety at night&lt;/a&gt;. One of my solutions to this is drugs. Initially the doctor prescribed some drowsy antihistamines, because they don't like to prescribe the good drugs because they're addictive. I decided it was better not to argue and just took the prescription, and hated them about as much as I expected - I feel &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; the next day.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had another conversation with a GP where I asked for some better sleeping pills. He explained that they don't like to prescribe those because you really shouldn't take them every night due to the addictive nature. I, in turn, explained that god I didn't want to take them every night. Ideally I'd &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; take them, and that having them beside my bed and never taking them was really the optimal use of sleeping pills in my view.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;See, the worst thing about anxiety at night is that it very easily escalates. If you're feeling slightly anxious it very easily turns into "oh no is this going to be another of &lt;em&gt;those&lt;/em&gt; nights again? I really don't want to be awake all night, that would be awful" etc. This rapidly turns into a much greater level of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if there are some sleeping pills next to the bed, the problem is solved. I've put a cap on how bad it can get, because the answer is just that it can get bad enough that I have to take a sleeping pill, and that's not that bad. The problem with the drowsy antihistamines is that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that bad to take them because the next day is going to suck.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As well as curbing the initial anxiety loop, this also opens up the opportunity to experiment more with other solutions. Get out of bed and have a chamomile tea, put on a Slay the Spire video, read for a little bit longer and try again, etc. A problem that you can guarantee is solved is one you can experiment with, because it lacks the sense of sense of desperation that surrounds a problem that is urgent, important, and possibly unsolvable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the GP was very relieved to hear me say this and prescribed me some better sleeping pills (I've not actually picked them up yet though).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A third example relevant to me today is that I have an absolute rule that I don't have to write anything I don't feel comfortable writing. This month has mostly been &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-01-13:23.html"&gt;writing from the heart&lt;/a&gt;, and the process for that is that I rummage around and find something that feels important to write about, and then write about it. Or I safeword out - if the thing that feels important to write about is something where I go "No, absolutely not", I don't, I can just write something else. That happened today, but it hasn't otherwise happened. On the other hand, many of the topics I've written about probably wouldn't have felt safe to write about if I didn't have that out available to me. This is essentially a variant of &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/believing-that-you-can-stop"&gt;Believing that you can stop&lt;/a&gt; - the ability to stop helps ensure that you don't have to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this sort of situation is very common, and often results in critical things that look like slack getting cut. If I can get things done without the day plan, I don't need the day plan, right? If I can get to sleep without taking a sleeping pill, why do I need the sleeping pills? As a result, often you get rid of the thing you weren't using, and then are suprised when everything gets worse, because what the thing was doing for you was providing you with the ability to not need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Projects that you can't run out of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was working on my new &lt;a href="https://consulting.drmaciver.com/"&gt;consulting website&lt;/a&gt; yesterday. I can't say it's the most exciting thing in the world, but one of the interesting things about working on it was that it gave me a project of a sort which I don't think I have that often, and that felt quite good.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't have a good term for such projects, but let me see if I can articulate what I'm pointing at.
They have the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can usefully absorb pretty much as much work as you're willing to put into them - they may plateau, but the work never becomes pointless or harmful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They don't &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to - you can stop pretty quickly and walk away and you'll have done something good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What you've done stays done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They feel neutral to positive to work on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example writing a blog isn't this, because it fails (1) - after a certain level of effort, a post starts getting worse rather than better, and if you write too much you just overwhelm the audience (people who want to keep up are already behind on reading my notebook, and I'm only writing daily! That's no more than an hour of work a day).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Projects that take a very long time to pay off also aren't this. e.g. a PhD, or even a paper, very much isn't this because if you walk away from it before it's successful, you've failed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Cleaning and general maintenance aren't this, partly because you have an obligation to keep on top of them - you can definitely fail to clean - and partly because they fail (3) and just undo themselves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of paid work fails at (4) but more interestingly paid work also often fails at (1). Paid work fairly rarely is something you can sink all your time into, because it starts to feel really bad to do that eventually - unless you're billing by the hour, you're being exploited. It goes against norms of work-life balance. Your coworkers resent you making them look bad. That sort of thing. Sometimes your employer &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; you to put unbounded amounts of effort into your paid work, but that's a different (and usually worse) problem which rarely results in positive feelings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Projects like this are really satisfying to me. I think it's partly because they don't trigger the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-18-13:15.html"&gt;difficulty finishing things&lt;/a&gt; but there's also something very satisfying about knowing that you can just give something your all and will be rewarded for it.
They give you a reliable way of turning hard work into positive feelings, and are usually a ready source of flow, and that's pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the interesting things about such projects is that, contra my recent line of thinking, they're not very good as team projects, because the problem is that if you're reliant on other people for working on something then you can't put unbounded amounts of work into it - you can put work until you get to something where you're blocked on other people for. I think this is part of why personal software projects are often much more satisfying (or at least differently satisfying) than shared projects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some other examples of work like this for me are Hypothesis (when I was still working on it) and, for a more trivial recent example, working on my Wordle solver. They're interesting problems that can be endlessly tinkered with to improve upon, but that I very quickly got to a point where it's good that they exist and would still be good even if I walked away from them now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another interesting, darker, class of examples is that I think everything that gets used to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html"&gt;drift&lt;/a&gt; has this character, but in a less nourishing way. I think the key difference is something like short-term vs long-term positive feelings. If I spend time playing a game, that produces good short-term feelings. Depending on how much time it may also cause good feelings in retrospect. e.g. I genuinely enjoy Slay the Spire and think it's worth the time I spend on it, but if I sank 80 hours a week into playing it, I would not feel good about that looking back.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps drift is, partly, looking for something of this sort and, lacking a good source of it, turning to the least bad ones available to us?&lt;/p&gt;
