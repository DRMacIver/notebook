&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Notes towards a name&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-04-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/connerdelights/status/1519705466854539265"&gt;Andrew Conner&lt;/a&gt; asked on Twitter "What would you call this?" where "this" means "the thing that is like philosophy but not", and this lead to a discussion between me, him, and David Chapman in which we all expressed our frustration as to what it is we actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;.  More specifically, what do we call it?
None of us know.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hubristically, I replied, "This seems like a dumb problem for us to have. Maybe I'll fix it". So here I am, trying to fix it. These are some rough notes that I am writing because it is useful to write out my thoughts on the subject, and sharing because they may be interesting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What is it I actually do?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the best way I can explain what I do is this: You know how some days you find yourself thinking "Holy shit why does being human not come with a user manual?". I'm trying to write that user manual.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, a completely impossible task. Such a user manual would be unusably vast, and I am not qualified to write more than a tiny fraction of it. That's OK. I'm not trying to write more than a tiny fraction of it, and most people don't need more than a tiny fraction of it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's perhaps more accurate to say that what I am trying to do is develop the general skill of writing the thing that you would get if you were to look up the section of the humanity user manual that you need right now.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My basic question is "What is it like to be human and how can we be better at it?"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;David Chapman has as a tagline "Better ways of thinking, feeling, and acting" and that definitely feels like part of what I do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"How to live" is maybe closer. It's a bit too close to the Aristotelean "How to have a good life" (which is not a frame I like).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps "How to think about living" is closer?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My tagline for my newsletter is "Overthinking everything", which is a bit tongue in cheek, but I do think captures something important.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps "Tools of thought for living"? Or "Tools for living".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"How to think about living in a way that helps you flourish"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have always liked "Human flourishing" as a turn of phrase. It's a little connected up to virtue ethics and the like, and I do tend to reject the eudaimonic frame of "happiness" as the end goal of life, partly because I don't think framing life as having a goal is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is something fundamentally ethical about my project though. "How to live" is very much the classical point of ethics, although not of modern ethics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is in general a theme of what I do. It's &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; a lot of things, but as they were meant to be and good though.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do think that what distinguishes me from philosophy in general is that I'm more interested in the practical side of it. If you consider the think/feel/act split, I'm interested in all three but my goals are in decreasing order of priority:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is funny because I'm primarily working on the think layer, but that's because it's a very high leverage layer (especially for me). How you think has a huge amount of impact on what you do and how you feel about it, and I'm trying to use thinking to improve your experience of the world. It is a focus on right action rather than right thought, and in getting these all to line up in a way that you feel good about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is part of why I'm not sure I'm a fan of applying the "philosophy" label to what I do. I don't love wisdom, I just say that to get it into bed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It does tie back into the virtue ethics thing again, but I do like "phronesis" as a word - practical wisdom. And to a large degree this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; what I work on. Practical wisdom for living.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What does David Chapman do?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Honestly, beats me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1519788775337074695"&gt;I said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that part of my problem with coming up with a common name is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sometimes I feel like you and I are working on basically the same problem and sometimes I feel like you and I are working on completely unrelated projects, and I'm not sure I could come up with a coherent justification for either feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I like David and I value our conversations, but I really don't know that I know what his project is about, and I suspect he feels the same way about me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So let's start with how David and I differ (aside from in our last names).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think his &lt;a href="https://metarationality.com/"&gt;metarationality&lt;/a&gt; project is probably heavily overlapping with mine, in that we're both concerned with the problem of how people think in practical contexts and how to do that better, but I think of his main work (certainly it's his Twitter handle!) is Meaningness, and this is the one I can't really tell if it's at all similar to what I'm doing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you look at &lt;a href="https://meaningness.com/"&gt;meaningness.com&lt;/a&gt; his tagline is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better ways of thinking, feeling, and acting—around problems of meaning and meaninglessness; self and society; ethics, purpose, and value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And we're kinda overlapping on all of this except... I don't feel like I'm particularly invested in the questions of meaning and purpose, which I think is rather his whole thing:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is about meaningness. “Meaningness” is a word I invented, referring to the quality of being meaningful and/or meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “meaning” has two quite different meanings in English. It can refer to the meaning of symbols, such as words and road signs. This book is not about that kind of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People also speak of “the meaning of life.” That is the sort of meaningness this book is about. So I apply “meaningness” only to the sorts of things one could describe as “deeply meaningful” or “pretty meaningless.” The book is about matters such as purpose, ethics, and selfhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaningness is a quality, not a thing. I don’t think there is a definite meaning of life. Meaningness is always nebulous: indefinite, uncertain, ambiguous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And I must admit I don't find this very personally interesting. It's not &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; connected to my project, but I think if someone came to me talking about this as their core issue I would probably start by checking if they were depressed, or if their life sucked in concrete manners.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do basically buy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eggprophet/status/1470425201615773702"&gt;eggprophet's model&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what if ur complicated, high status problems like "meaning crisis" "culture war" "societies fall in epicureanism" are actually simple, low-status problems like "bored" "want community" "need blanket"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Bored" definitely feels closer to any problem I want to address than "lack of meaning" does.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear, I don't mean this as a dismissal of David's project. I love it when other people get deeply invested in things that I don't find very interesting, because then I can come in afterwards and extract the bits that I care about and wouldn't have figured out on my own. But this does suggest that David's meaningness project and my project are not necessarily that closely tied.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to be lucky</title>
    <updated>2022-05-25T10:01:29+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;How to be lucky&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-25&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be doing some draft bankruptcy over the coming week or two,
where I delete things from my newsletter drafts and post salvageable bits
here on the notebook.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's some extracts from a piece called "How to be lucky" that I may or may
not eventually write, but certainly will want to start from scratch with 
a little bit of reused material rather than trying to ressurect this draft.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Luck, happenstance, and circumstance&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'd like to distinguish three different things that are often called
luck, and I will only use "luck" to refer to one of them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first thing is what I'd like to call &lt;em&gt;happenstance&lt;/em&gt;. An event that
happens as a result of chance. You might win the lottery, you might be
late for a meeting, you might go a different route than usual and
discover something interesting... These are all chance events, they
might be good they might be bad, they might be neutral.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People will often refer to individual happenstance events as lucky or
unlucky, which is perfectly reasonable in normal usage but not how I
will be using the term. Winning the lottery is not, in the sense I will
be using it, the result of luck, it's just random chance. Could have
happened to anyone who played the lottery. If you exhibited a consistent
tendency to win the lottery I would call &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; luck, but not a single
win no matter how large, it's just a highly positive happenstance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Circumstance on the other hand is the conditions in which you find
yourself. This too is often referred to as luck. e.g. you're lucky to be
born into a rich family, you're lucky to have good friends, you're lucky
to be in a secure job, etc. I again think this is perfectly reasonable
usage, but it's not what I mean when I say "luck" here.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I say luck, what I specifically mean is the aggregate effect of
happenstance in your life. Good luck is the tendency of chance events
to, on average, improve your life. Bad luck is the tendency of chance
events to, again on average, make your life worse.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Four types of circumstance&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about circumstances and how they impact luck. Many of these
things will be out of your control (or only weakly under your control),
and I'll talk about things that are more under your control in a bit,
but I think it's important to be up front about the different fortune
landscapes people find themselves in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to be lucky is to have circumstances that enable
it. Here are some such circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first way is that you can be rich, either in money or other
resources. Luck is, ultimately, about being able to benefit from random
chance, and this involves playing a lot of numbers games. By far the
easiest way to be able to play numbers games is to have a lot of buffer
against risk. If a great opportunity comes your way and it costs £1000
but will probably earn you much more than that (in money or other
value), then there are roughly three options: You might not be able to
pay £1000 at all, in which case sucks to be you. £1000 might be
affordable but not an amount you can comfortably risk, in which case you
may or may not take the opportunity but you certainly can't take the
next such opportunity that comes along if this one falls through. Or you
can be well enough off that £1000 isn't a big deal to risk given the
high upside. Rich people are luckier than poor people because they have
the opportunity to take advantage of many sources of happenstances that
improve their life that are too risky if you're poor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second way is that you can be extroverted, sociable, etc. Social
connections are one of the biggest and most accessible source of luck in
day to day life - you meet people who will transform your life, your
social circumstances, give you access to opportunities you'd otherwise
lack, etc. There's &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0190272518812010"&gt;a whole paper about how the best way to be lucky is
to go to more
parties&lt;/a&gt;.
It's much easier to take advantage of this if you naturally want to
spend lots of time socialising, are good at it, and find it emotionally
rewarding rather than a source of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third way is that you can be
pretty (I tend to use "pretty" in a gender neutral sense. There are some very
pretty men out there. That being said, the way this manifests is definitely different with different genders).
This tends to raise the chances of success in a lot of circumstances - people will
seek you out more, give you more opportunities, you'll benefit from halo
effects, etc. Being pretty tends to both increase the number of
opportunities (because they seek you out) and increase the chances of
any of those opportunities that depend on the judgement of others from
working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these are somewhat changeable but are at best hard to change,
and aren't necessarily where your bottleneck &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Luck as a skill&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn't mean you can learn to be supernaturally lucky. There's
no way you can, for example, improve your ability to play the lottery.
You will probably, on average, be luckier if you &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; play the
lottery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It also doesn't mean that everyone's luck is purely determined by their
skill. There are roughly three components to luck, in decreasing order
of importance for most people:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Privilege&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes, chance is the &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; important component of luck, I promise. It's
not that chance doesn't matter, it's that if chance matters too much you
are not actually being lucky.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason, in short, is that luck mostly occurs as the sum of many
chance events, and statistically the chance effects average out over
time. If you toss a coin 100 times, you've no ability to predict which
way any given coin toss will go, but you'll get heads about 50 times,
and you'll with overwhelming likelihood get heads between about 30 and
70 times.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Privilege on the other hand can matter a great deal. For example, people
who are unusually attractive or unusually intelligent will have a much
easier time being lucky (more on why later). It's also &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt; easier
to be lucky if you're wealthy or have other resources you can draw on.
If that's you, you can capitalise on it, and it's worth paying attention
to, but ultimately what matters more is how these affect your ability to
develop the skill of luck than the privilege itself.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the most important part: Skill. This is the most
important part both because it's the bit that matters the most, and also
because it's the bit that's most under your control.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;An informal mathematical glossary&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here I've deleted a lot of material that I covered better in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-29-09:43.html"&gt;Probably enough probability for you&lt;/a&gt; so go read that bit instead.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Luck 101&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Luck is a numbers game. Luck is the aggregate result of many small
events, each of which is unlikely to have any upside, but which on
average have a much greater upside than their cost. Let's call these
events &lt;em&gt;opportunities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Getting luckier is a process involving two things:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing the number of opportunities you take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improving the average effectiveness of opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Privilege affects these differently. e.g. Being resource-rich tends to
make the first easy, being attractive tends to maximise the second, but
both are under your control to a large degree.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, note that this is somewhat non-uniform, in that the &lt;em&gt;types&lt;/em&gt; of
opportunities available to you matter a great deal. It's possible to
e.g. be very lucky in business but have no luck in dating (or vice
versa), due to being good at these in one context and bad in another.
This is particularly true for people who have never spent much time
strategizing about luck in general and have just, well, lucked into some
good habits in some specific contexts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Lottery luck&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Imagine a simple lottery, you pay £1, you have a one in 10 million
chance of winning £1 million. You play the lottery, and unsurprisingly
you don't win. Someone else plays the lottery, and they do. Are they
luckier than you?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this specific instance, they have certainly been luckier than you,
but in a generalisable sense they are not. What actually happened is
that millions of people played the lottery, so even though every
individual one was a sucker, one or two people got lucky. Those people
have what you might call lottery luck - it's a one off unrepeatable event,
and any strategy for improving your luck that relies on lottery luck is
a losing game.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can think of the basic practice of luck as being about trying
repeatedly, and seeking lottery luck is &lt;em&gt;actively harmful&lt;/em&gt; for this
because the more times you try the worse off you will be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What would have come next&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the point at which the draft trails off, which is unfortunate as what comes next is all the interesting bits.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What I was planning on covering next ties together:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The work of Richard Wiseman in his book "The Luck Factor" which I think is
  a very good book for getting better at an important but kinda boring type of
  luck.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Lui's notion of &lt;a href="https://brianlui.dog/2020/10/06/upside-decay/"&gt;Upside decay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lewis Hyde's book "Trickster Makes This World", which is about trickster myths and what they teach us about luck and creativity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core idea being that the most interesting skill of luck is treating your engagement with the world as a creative process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a mild post mortem note, I think one thing this points to is that when writing a newsletter post I should &lt;em&gt;start by writing the interesting bits&lt;/em&gt;. Then I can backfill to give people an onramp to it if I think that's actually necessary. Write the newsletter more like the notebook, so that when I hit the point where I'm done and don't want to write any more I can just click send. Writing as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-23-15:52.html"&gt;an anytime algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Promethean work</title>
    <updated>2022-05-26T07:12:18+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Promethean work&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is another draft bankruptcy post. The following is the only
bit I had written from a post entitled "Stealing lifehacks from the gods":&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do you ever think about how weird it would be to be in the myth of
Prometheus?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prometheus stumbles into camp, looking haggard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Prometheus, you have returned from Mount Olympus! What have you
brought back from your time among the gods?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Uh, well, I've brought back the secret of fire. Pretty sure that'll
be helpful. Very useful stuff, fire."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Tell us, oh great Prometheus! What powers must we invoke to summon
fire? What rituals must we perform?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Um, yes. Rituals. OK, so, you take some dry grass, and two sticks."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Grass... and sticks? Do we fashion these into an offering? Do we
carve runes into them?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"No, you see, what you do is, you rub the sticks together. After a
while they'll get real hot. Then you put the hot sticks on the grass
and it'll catch fire because dry things catch fire when they get hot."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What the actual fuck, Prometheus."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yeah, kicking myself for not thinking of it on my own TBH. Still,
it's a simple enough trick that at least the gods won't be super mad
at me for borrowing it, huh?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Please note that this both entirely misrepresents &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prometheus"&gt;the myth of
Prometheus&lt;/a&gt; and also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8C8qPoMZdo"&gt;how to
start a fire with sticks&lt;/a&gt;.
But in my defence it's funnier that way)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This actually &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1521187395319836676"&gt;got turned into a tweet&lt;/a&gt; way earlier,
and was probably more like a tweet worth of idea.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The core to this is that a lot of what I do is go into complicated specialised disciplines and try to take their most accessible ideas and make them broadly useful. This is Promethean work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1520007832556474368"&gt;related tweet&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have seen far, it is because I have repeatedly wandered up to giants and asked "Gosh! How did you get so tall?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Leaving shiny things behind</title>
    <updated>2022-05-27T14:18:27+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Leaving shiny things behind&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something I've been thinking about recently is how useful it is to have names to describe crucial aspects of your problems.
Not that this is a new thought, but it's been on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result of this thought process, I realised I needed a name for a particular phenomenon: The way it is very hard for me to focus in the presence of my phone, which tends to grab my attention and lead to me checking Twitter without really meaning to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I propose the following name: The phone is a &lt;em&gt;shiny thing&lt;/em&gt;. Shiny things catch your eye with their glint, in a way that makes it hard to avoid looking at them. As long as they are in your field of awareness somehow, you have to put in active effort to not pay attention to them, because they have a natural gravity to them that distracts and captures your attention.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shiny things aren't necessarily interesting or desirable.
Another example of a shiny thing is when the TV is on in a room, even with the sound off - even if you literally couldn't care less about what's on the TV, the fact that it is there with its attractive moving pictures tends to naturally draw your attention. Observe how much less engaged a conversation happening in a room with the TV on in the background is, even when you could in theory easily ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shiny things aren't intrinsically bad - I like my phone, I like Twitter, I like watching TV - but they are bad to have around &lt;em&gt;when your purpose is not to engage with the shiny thing&lt;/em&gt;, because they entice and draw your attention. Even if you successfully avoid them, you expend energy on doing so that could be more productively used. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's possible that a sufficiently advanced set of mental skills could allow one to be immune to shiny things. It's not unlike &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/first-hard-choice"&gt;The first hard choice&lt;/a&gt;, where you would like to be able to listen to the sirens' song without being drawn onto the rocks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But unlike the sirens, there is no virtue to being in the presence of a shiny thing that you don't currently want to use. It's just a pure cost. They can be there when you actively choose to use them, but they should be put away when you do not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lately I've been going on my stupid little walks for my stupid mental and physical health without my phone, and it has greatly improved the experience. Sometimes I bring a book, sometimes I bring a dictaphone, but neither of these are shiny in the way that my phone is, and so they do not distract me from doing whatever it is I choose to do in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's another abandoned draft, which is about the costs that being illegible
impose on your interactions with the world.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Many to one interactions&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let me start with some experiences of mine that you may or may not share
that I think are usefully illustrative of a broader problem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a tweet, or blog post, or something similar become
unexpectedly popular? The &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/people-dont-work-as-much-as-you-think"&gt;People don't work as much as you
think&lt;/a&gt;
piece was this for me recently. To a much lesser degree, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1493181712427274241"&gt;this recent
tweet about many versions of a thing being evidence that none of them
are good&lt;/a&gt; is
another one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What happens is this: You get a lot of people responding in obvious
ways. Maybe they've misunderstood you. Maybe they're picking up on
something you missed, or didn't think was worth mentioning. Maybe they
disagree with you on ideological grounds. There are plenty of reasons to
make an obvious response.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At first, you can respond reasonably enough to these - pointing out
their misunderstandings, acknowledging that yes thank you for pointing
out that edge case but you were already aware of it and don't think it's
a problem, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By the fifth time someone has made the same point at you, it's much
harder to stay polite, and by the hundredth message it doesn't really
matter if the observation is novel you just want these people to shut up
and leave you alone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can try getting cranky at them, and indeed it will probably be
incredibly hard work not to get cranky at them, but fundamentally it
doesn't work because the only reason crankiness can be a useful strategy
is when other people notice it &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you have to get cranky at them
and modify their behaviour accordingly, and if the people doing this
were actually paying attention to others' behaviour they wouldn't be
repeating the same points you've already heard a dozen time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an example of an &lt;em&gt;asymmetric cost&lt;/em&gt; - although the cost of the
interaction is about the same for you and the other party, when you are
interacting with many people, the cost of their behaviour on you is
effectively much larger than any cost you can impose on them, because
they only have to pay it once, while you have to pay it once for each of
them. The cost of the interaction is effectively multiplied by the
number of people you have to have it with, which for you is large and
for them is you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is not just a Twitter thing. Another (comparatively trivial)
example of this is that I have to explain my name to people over and
over again, and it gets tiresome. Yes that's a capital I, not a lower
case l. No, it's pronounced Mack-ee-ver, not Mack-ay-ver. Yes, it's
Scottish, but I'm not. No, it's not spelled or pronounced like the guy
with the paperclips. Yes that joke you've just made about it is
extremely witty and I definitely haven't heard if five hundred times
before. Ha ha.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not a big deal, and I generally remain polite throughout these
conversations, but there is definitely an internal sigh of resignation
as I think "Oh, we're having this conversation again are we?" each time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem with these sorts of asymmetric costs is that, like the
Twitter thing, they're almost by definition invisible to those who
impose them on you, because if they were there during That Conversation,
even if it was initiated with someone else, they wouldn't have to have
it again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Many to few interactions&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This comes up in more serious conversations too. Vegetarians are often
tired of having a conversation justifying their vegetarianism, people
are often tired of having a conversation justifying their religion or
lack thereof. Coming out as queer, poly, trans, etc. is something you
end up doing over and over again, and for most people it's tiring and
scary every time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The difference with these conversations however is that you're not the
only one having them and, as a result, chances may be pretty good that
someone you encounter outside of your group has already encountered one
of you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're in a population with a 50/50 split between two groups (e.g.
gender), there is no asymmetry in the obvious conversations you have -
there is one man for every woman, more or less, so the number of obvious
day to day conversations you have is about equal. This falls apart in a
whole number of cases - e.g. in environments with large gender skews (In
either direction! There are large asymmetric costs in being e.g. a dad
in parental spaces dominated by mums, as well as e.g. being a woman in
software), and in situations in which the size of your demographic is in
some sense "artificially lowered" because of visibility (e.g. you'll get
to have all sorts of obvious conversations with men if you're a woman
whose tweet goes unexpectedly popular). But, by default, regardless of
how bad communication tends to be between the two groups there tends not
to be asymmetry of the sort that I'm talking about because the numbers
are broadly equal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, as the groups get smaller the asymmetry grows sharply. If
your group is x% of the conversation, then there are (100 - x) / x
people not in your group for every member who is. For example if you're
20% of the population, there are four of them for every one of you, if
you're 1% of the population there are 99 of them for every one of you,
etc. This means that, all else being equal, the smaller your group is,
the higher the asymmetric costs you experience as a member of it
interacting with people outside it are.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course, all else is rarely equal. I am, for example, a member of the
group of people with weird names. We're a relatively small group, but
also the cost per interaction is relatively
low, (Once you reach adulthood anyway. Children are &lt;em&gt;brutal&lt;/em&gt; about this),
so even though the costs imposed are highly asymmetric, the total costs are still not that bad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Necessary conversations&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of the time this problem can be solved by just ignoring it. I
don't have to correct people on my name, you don't have to tell people
about your vegetarianism, or your religion, or any other thing that
makes you unusual, unless it's directly relevant to the interaction.
This often brings down the rate enough to be manageable even if the cost
per interaction is relatively high.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This works great right up until the point where you need to do it. For
example, if you're vegetarian, you will often need to explain this to
people in order to be able to make sure you can eat something at a
location. If you have disabilities (visible or otherwise) you may need
to explain them in order to get accommodations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you need to be understood not for your sake, but because it's
the only way to get other people off your back. For example I think
about &lt;a href="https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-is-it-hard-to-acknowledge-preferences?r=514ov"&gt;this Astral Codex Ten post about respecting
preferences&lt;/a&gt;
a lot:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently stayed at a B&amp;amp;B owned by a nice elderly couple. Very, very
nice. The moment I stepped in the door, they asked how my flight was,
where I was from, what I did, how I'd enjoyed my three minutes of
visiting their city so far, what kind of food I liked, what my
favorite color was, et cetera. I played along - no point in offending
people - but I warned that my friend, who would be arriving a little
later, was much more introverted, and would appreciate being
efficiently directed to her room without the welcome committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little later, my friend arrived. From my room, I could hear them
start welcoming her, ask her how her flight had been, start trying to
get to know her - until I ran out and rescued her, for which she
reports gratitude. For the rest of our stay, they continued to talk
both of our ears off, with my friend growing increasingly annoyed and
uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spent the trip back dissecting what had gone wrong. Neither of us
believed the proprietors didn't care about her feelings: they were so
very, very nice. They couldn't have forgotten my warning; my friend
arrived less than an hour after I did. We concluded that they were
just inexplicably bad at some sort of mental gear-shifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst part was, I knew this would happen. When I told them to
please respect my friend's introversion, there was a voice in my head
quietly adding "...even though you obviously won't and I have no
idea why I am even making this request".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't think all that's going on here is a failure of understanding,
but I do think it starts with a failure of understanding. People hear
preferences and round them out to someone just making a fuss, because
they can't internalise what an extremely big deal that preference is for
the other person.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think, to some degree, this is reasonable - people are constantly
imposing their preferences on us, and it's impossible to respect all of
them, so people tend to disregard a lot of things as unimportant, or as
something they're not obliged to respect. Just because you have a
preference to be referred to as Your Majesty and tithed 10% of my wealth
annually, doesn't mean that I have to do that. In order for me to
respect that preference you must either force or convince me to do so.
Generally we frown upon the "force" option unless you're &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; an
imperial power, so you should try to convince me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This happens with more reasonable preferences too - to continue the
vegetarianism example, there's a lot of work that goes in to persuading
people to respect your dietary preferences. Virtually everyone who has
such preferences have stories of them being argued with or ignored
(often covertly! Many people think it's perfectly reasonable to e.g.
sneak butter into something that they serve to someone who has said they
can't eat dairy. This is a really bad idea, but distressingly common).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can argue that people shouldn't need to understand your preferences
in order to respect them and you'd be, more or less, right, but the fact
of the matter is regardless of whether they should do that people mostly
do, and I'd argue that some degree of this is pretty much inevitable.
It's really hard to respect preferences you don't understand - it goes
against how memory works, you reliably fuck details up, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Certainly people should be a lot better at this than they currently are,
but expecting people to be maximally good at meeting preferences without
understanding them very much goes against how humans work, and besides
which can only possibly work at a very shallow level (though the shallow
level is still important for interactions with strangers).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;When you are hard to understand&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So you want to respect people's dietary constraints and preferences?
Thanks, that's great. I don't eat dairy, wheat (really most cereals in
its family are bad. "gluten free" isn't quite right but to a first
approximation is probably fine), brassicas, or lamb. Some onions are
fine if they're cooked but too many is likely to be a problem. Lentil
heavy dishes are probably a bad idea, but things that use lentil flour
seem to be mostly fine. Also I prefer not to eat fish for ethical
reasons, but don't worry about that as a one off.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You've probably almost immediately forgotten the details of that
paragraph. As well you should. Why would you memorise the details of my
food preferences if you're not cooking extremely regularly for me?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My experience is that almost nobody can keep track of my dietary
preferences, even before you get to the complicated ones. I normally
don't even mention anything past "No wheat, no dairy, no brassicas, and
you're probably fine but maybe check in with me if you're unsure?", and
this is usually still at least one too many details to keep track of
(people never remember the brassicas one, but unfortunately it's very
important).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is actually completely reasonable, because there are two different
asymmetric costs that are going on here: The first is the one to me, the
annoying conversation around dietary preferences that I have to have
with everyone who cooks for me. The second is the one that people have
when they cook for others, trying to keep track of everyone's food
preferences. Sometimes one cost dominates, sometimes the other, but
either way it's really quite a lot of work to keep track of everything
that everyone can and can't eat (I think I'm unusually good at this, and it's a lot of work to be good at
it and also I still get things wrong.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem with my particular set of food constraints is that there is
no sensible organising principle to them. It's just a list of
empirically derived things that trigger my digestive system to freak
out. If there were a simple term that allowed people to check whether
something was suitable for me (e.g. gluten-free and dairy-free are both
examples of that, and people can usually stretch themselves to
remembering two terms) and that they could remember as being normal
problems for people to have, they would probably mostly
remember.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Though people absolutely can and do get these wrong. If you're not used
to doing it it's really hard to remember to check the ingredients list
and see if some asshole has snuck wheat into somewhere where wheat
really doesn't need to go.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even with more reasonable food constraints, you end up with a problem
that asymmetric costs are not always additive. It's much harder to cook
for someone who is both dairy-free and gluten-free than it is to cook
for someone who is one but not both. (It's also much harder to cook for
two people where one is dairy-free and one is gluten-free at the same
time, for much the same reason). It's not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as hard to cook for
them if you don't have to do it at the same time (e.g. one guest one
night, one guest another), but it is easier to cook for two separate
gluten-free or two separate dairy-free guests than it is to cook for one
gluten-free and one dairy-free guest, because you learn skills and
habits with each - it's not just a matter of not doing the thing after
all, it's a matter of learning how to achieve your goal (producing a
delicious meal) while not achieving the thing, and that takes actual
effort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's easy to discount this effort, because you have curse of knowledge
around your own experience - it's hard to remember how hard it is to
understand something once you already understand it - but it is a real
effort that people have to expend to understand you. And it's not just
about diet, it's about everything else - things that annoy you, your
preferences for social interaction, triggers, pronouns, etc. All things
that it's completely reasonable to want other people to keep track of,
but also all things that contribute to the cognitive load of what others
have to keep track about us.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;The web of legibility&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this point the post basically turns into an attempt to integrate the
following two previous posts of mine here on the notebook:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html"&gt;Legibility as a relationship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-23-09:37.html"&gt;Legibility privileges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is another one where I did all the framing work and ran out of energy by the point I got to the meat of the post.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;What every programming tutorial gets wrong&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-29&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another piece of draft bankruptcy. This is my attempt to explain a common
failure mode of programming tutorials. I got quite far, but eventually
abandoned it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Scene setting&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A while ago I was helping teach a coding workshop to a bunch of people
who had never coded before, and we were working through the written
materials which were very "Do this, then do that". Copy this code and
you should see this happen, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At some point a student asked me "OK, but what is actually going on
here? What does any of this mean? I can follow the steps, but I have no
idea what is going on."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This was an incredibly reasonable question and I'm glad she asked it of
me, and that I could answer it, because I can't imagine that she would
have come away with any knowledge of programming without it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can't remember the specific thing we were talking about, but I think
the example was something like:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"login"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Bob"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"login"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;"Bob"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"some other key"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
  File &lt;span class="nb"&gt;"&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;"&lt;/span&gt;, line &lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;span class="n"&gt;&amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;KeyError&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="n"&gt;'some other key'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is entirely clear if you're a programmer (especially if you're a
Python programmer, but it's sufficiently universal that probably most
programmers will have a pretty good idea of what's going on), but if
you've never programmed before it's just so much noise.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In response to this question I would have said something as follows:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The program you're using here is called the REPL(Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop,
but don't worry about that. It's pronounced
repple, like ripple with an eh). You're entering commands into it by writing statements in a
programming language called Python.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The interpreter keeps track of a number of "objects", which are a chunk
of data along with a particular set of commands that can you can use to
change that data, ask questions about it, etc. There are also commands
that let you interact with the computer more broadly (e.g. reading and
writing files) but we won't worry about them just yet in this tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here what we're doing is creating an object, giving it the name &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt;
that we can refer to it by, and issuing some commands and seeing what
happens.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we are:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating an object of a specific type called a &lt;em&gt;dictionary&lt;/em&gt; and
    referring to it by the name &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt;. The curly brackets &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt; create a
    new dictionary, and "&lt;code&gt;user =&lt;/code&gt;" is where we declare that we will
    refer to it as &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dictionary is an object whose job is to keep track of a table of
    information. It maps &lt;em&gt;keys&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;values&lt;/em&gt;, which are just arbitrary
    things you can put into it, so that if you tell it to associate a
    value with particular key, and then later ask for the value
    associated with that key, you get the same thing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telling the dictionary we have just created (referred to by its
    name, &lt;em&gt;user&lt;/em&gt;) that it should associate the value "Bob" with the key
    "login". "Bob" and "login" are objects of a type called &lt;em&gt;string&lt;/em&gt;,
    which represents a piece of text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking up the key "login" and getting the expected value "Bob"
    back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking up the key "some other key" and getting an error that tells
    us that the dictionary has not yet been told to associate any values
    with that key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't a perfect answer, because I just made it up on the spot and
haven't tested it against students to see what questions they ask, but
it's probably pretty good. It certainly gives them more of a hook to
play around with dictionaries in the interpreter and see what happens,
and it gives them better questions to ask than "Help I don't understand
anything about what's going on".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Theory, examples, and ability&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm going to be using "theory", "examples", and "ability", in slightly
specific ways (which are possibly slightly idiosyncratic to me, although
I think compatible with normal use) in this issue, so I'll try to
explain what I mean by them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An example is just any concrete version of the thing being taught. For
example, "do these steps in the REPL" above is an example. Showing
someone a program is an example. Showing someone a mathematical proof is
an example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Theory" is the knowledge that you need to answer questions like "What's
going on here?" and explain the behaviour of a particular example. For
example, in the above, you need some sort of theory to answer the
question "Why did typing &lt;code&gt;user["login"]&lt;/code&gt; show &lt;code&gt;"Bob"&lt;/code&gt; but typing
&lt;code&gt;user["some other key"]&lt;/code&gt; showed an error message?"&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Ability" is the set of things the student can now do themselves. The
goal of teaching is to help the student expand their abilities. People
don't generally expand their abilities directly as the result of
teaching - you can only learn to do things by doing things - but
teaching points them in the right direction by giving them better ideas
of things to try. They still learn by trial and error, but teaching can
give them better things to try and help them understand their errors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The goal of the above tutorial was to help them develop the ability to
write simple Python programs involving dictionaries, and to some degree
it succeeded. After going through this tutorial the student knows how to
launch the Python REPL, and has at least one example of something
reasonable to experiment with. Given a little bit of time to sit and
play with the REPL they might come up with a pretty reasonable theory
for explaining its behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why do they need to develop that theory? Because theory gives them the
ability to &lt;em&gt;generalise&lt;/em&gt;. If you have a theory that can explain why a
given action succeeded or failed, you now believe that any action that
matches that same explanation will also work or fail. This lets you try
out other things and see whether they confirm or deny your theory, which
is typically a much more productive model of trial and error than one
can manage without a theory of what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Examples are vitally important&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I should be clear: It is very good that the tutorial we were doing was
dumping people in the REPL and getting them to play around with it. This
is not my complaint, it's the correct thing to do. My complaint is that
the tutorial did not then contain anything like my answer above.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of my pet peeves that has been coming out in places on the notebook
blog recently is that I hate people who introduce theory without
supporting examples in which to understand it. See e.g. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-02-09:29.html"&gt;People are bad
at defining
things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In particular it's often worth having examples &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; (this isn't
always possible), because then you can refer to concrete features of
them while introducing the theory. You saw a bit of that in how I
explained what was going on in the programming tutorial: I started with
an example, and then I highlighted specific features of it to ground the
theory (We're creating a thing called an object, it's a specific type
of object called a dictionary, then we're doing this to it, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The examples are particularly important. In order to understand a
theory, you need to be able to see how it applies to real concrete
things. Abstracting from concrete instances is literally the point of
theory, so without seeing how it relates to the things it abstracts
theory is just so many words.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On top of that, examples are often key to developing abilities. People
do not, generally speaking, reason from first principles from a theory.
If you read the literature on naturalised decision
making, what people
tend to do is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recognition_primed_decision"&gt;recognition-primed decision
making&lt;/a&gt;. They
look at what's in front of them, they reason by analogy, thinking "Oh,
this looks like that thing I saw before, let me see what happens if I do
the same thing that I did there...". Having a rich and varied library of
examples is vitally important for this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I'd recommend Cedric Chin's &lt;a href="https://commoncog.com/blog/a-framework-for-putting-mental-models-to-practice/"&gt;A Framework for Putting Mental Models into
Practice&lt;/a&gt;,
but it's also worth reading Gary Klein's "Sources of Power" and maybe
some of his other work.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Theory helps you remember examples&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's look at our example again:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"login"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Bob"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"login"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;"Bob"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"some other key"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gt"&gt;Traceback (most recent call last):&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;   File "&amp;lt;stdin&amp;gt;", line 1, in &amp;lt;module&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="gr"&gt;KeyError&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="n"&gt;'some other key' &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do you think you could recreate this example from memory? I certainly
could, and I think most programmers could with only a little bit of
thought. It possibly wouldn't be character by character perfect, but you
could certainly get the right general idea.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now consider the following highly readable example. Do you think you
could recreate &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; from memory?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; d"T{ o Bm&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; d"T{sn)gK[ena o n:g}n&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; d"T{sn)gK[ena&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;n:g}n&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; d"T{sn"gyT g](T{ tTuna&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;&amp;gt;{ilT}ilt kyg"] {TlTe] li)) )i"]'1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;   ,[)T nE"]h[e&amp;lt;n= )[eT b= [e Eyghd)T&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;FTuc{{g{1 r"gyT g](T{ tTur&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you haven't figured out the trick, this is the same example as above,
I've just jumbled all the letters through a mapping that replaces them
(e.g. &amp;gt; gets replaced with &amp;lt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Do you think you could recreate this example from memory? I sure
couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In some sense this contains exactly the same information as the
original, but because you're unable to easily turn it into a sensible
representation, it's much harder to remember and thus much harder to
understand. As well as the Python specific bits you also rely on e.g.
brackets matching, quotes matching, familiar understanding of the
meaning of the = symbol, the ability to clearly distinguish which bits
are identifiers because they're contained in quotes, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When we know what's going on, we can describe the example as the
following sequence of steps:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a dictionary called user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insert the value "Bob" into "user" with the key "login"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look up the key "login" in "user" and get the result&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look up the key "some other key" in "user" and see an error from
    looking up a missing key&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;high level representation&lt;/em&gt; of what's going on. It describes
the steps we are taking, not the specific details that we know. This is
easy to remember, because it's a set of comprehensible steps.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, we're not expecting students to actually memorise specific
examples, but ability to memorise is a pretty good proxy for how well
the example fits in their head - if you can't easily remember what
should be a fairly simple example, that's a sign that there's too much
going for you to really figure it out and you're trying to learn too
much at once.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sort of translation into a high level representation is what theory
does for you, and lets you organise your mental library of examples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Theory helps you generalise&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As well as helping you remember examples you've seen before, theory lets
you &lt;em&gt;adapt&lt;/em&gt; those previous examples to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This high level representation does a number of important things for us:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It allows us to understand the meaning of the thing we are writing
    in terms of what we are trying to do rather than the literal
    characters on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes it easier to remember because we can remember "Create a
    dictionary called user" separately from the literal syntax for
    creating a dictionary. We still have to remember both, but the
    latter is a fact we can more easily look up and will use often
    enough to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lets us make predictions for what we would see if we changed the
    example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Doing (the right) things is the most important&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This particularly shows up in the trial and error process of learning.
While you are still floundering around trying to figure things out, good
specific examples are especially important because you will lean hard
on emulating examples, so having good examples to emulate is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is where I stalled. I'm not quite sure why. I think partly the
post was getting too long, and I didn't know how to continue, or
I ran out of energy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's a known problem that I'm very bad at revisiting things once
I've stopped writing them, and as a result I tend to fail to
finish longer pieces. I would like to work on that but have not
yet managed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Victims of metonymy</title>
    <updated>2022-05-30T18:42:36+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Victims of metonymy&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an outtake from an earlier version of &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/learning-to-walk-through-walls"&gt;Learning to walk through walls&lt;/a&gt; that I was vaguely planning to spin out into a full newsletter post, but I'm not going to do that, so here it is in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I know a lot of people who think they're bad at reading books. They're
not, they're just victims of metonymy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Metonymy is when "&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy"&gt;a thing or concept is referred to by the name of
something closely associated with that thing or
concept&lt;/a&gt;". In fact, to a very
large degree, this &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; happens when you talk about an action,
because most actions are vastly more
&lt;a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/"&gt;indexical&lt;/a&gt;
than their symbolic representation would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When you say you are "bad at reading", reading is standing in for a much
more specific action that you are bad at. You are not &lt;em&gt;bad at reading&lt;/em&gt;,
you are &lt;em&gt;reading in a way that you are bad at&lt;/em&gt; (often in a way that
anyone would be bad at). The same is true of being bad at almost
anything else. Often when &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-do-everything?s=w"&gt;you have to find the trick of being good at
something&lt;/a&gt;,
what this really means is that you have to stop doing it the bad way and
stop doing the good way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But it takes a very long time for this to occur to you, because until
this is pointed out in your head the name stands in for the action. This
is what is done. In your library of agency when you look up the action
"read a book", there is a particular physical action that comes up. You
do that, and it goes badly, and you conclude you are bad at reading when
the actual problem is that you are reading in a way that gives you
eyestrain, or is physically uncomfortable, or doesn't give you a way to
burn off nervous energy, or something else. Try experimenting with &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-13-09:56.html"&gt;how
to actually physically read a
book&lt;/a&gt; and
see if any variations are easier than others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is one of the ways that symbolization of the world lies to you.
Just because you can name something that doesn't mean that name has
predictive power. If I invent the word splorf to refer to either cats or
things that are coloured a weird vomity green, I can't meaningfully say
whether I like splorf or not, because cats are great and weird vomity
green things are not, but a lesser version of this is what you're doing
every time you conclude you are bad at a general category because you
are bad at some specific thing named by it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some categories &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have predictive power and after you've tried a
number of variations it may be totally legitimate to conclude that you
really are bad at the thing named, but often we will jump straight from
the action to the label without bothering to test whether this is valid.
That's being a victim of metonymy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intelligence problems</title>
    <updated>2022-05-31T11:27:28+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Intelligence problems&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-05-31&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's a draft I abandoned basically because I find this subject extremely
stressful to talk about and low-key expect people to shout at me every time
I talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This sucks, because it's an important subject to me that I genuinely think
most people I know would benefit from understanding better, so I've decided
that even if I can't bring myself to finish this as is I'm just going to post
what I've got and hope it's useful to people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Please don't shout at me about it. I'll be sad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Unspoken privileges&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I need to start with some theory, because it will help contextualise the
thing I want to actually talk about today.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The feminist concept of "privilege" is very important and useful, and
also tends to get people's backs up because people (including those who
are most willing to level it as an accusation at others) rarely like being
called privileged.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Ages ago I saw a proposal to replace the term with "blind spots", but it
never caught on. Unclear to what degree that was because it's kinda
ableist, and to what degree that was because it was much harder to hurl
it as an insult at your opponent in a fight on the internet.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I tend to use a slightly modified version which replaces "privilege"
with "privileges". It's not a question of whether you are or aren't
privileged, but instead what privileges you do and don't have. We all
have privileges, but some of us have significantly more privileges than
others, and many of those privileges are in some way connected to shared
characteristics - e.g. I have male privileges, those privileges
associated with being male, or with being white, two of the main sources of
privilege typically discussed in feminist contexts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A "privilege" in this context just means any benefit I typically get or,
in particular, any source of problems that I get not to have. Anything
that makes your life easier or better, and is not reliably shared with
everyone else. e.g. due to the aforementioned being white and male,
there are a lot of contexts I can just walk into and assume (mostly
correctly) that I will be taken seriously and this does indeed make my
life easier and better.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there are a number of privileges that I don't think get talked about
enough, because it's considered in poor taste to admit that you have
them, and I think this is a major problem because these are also
privileges that I think are among the best predictors of success.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The chief unspoken privileges of this form that I'm aware of are being
rich, being attractive, and being smart. You're not supposed to talk
about them because doing so seems like boasting. It's safe to talk about
white privilege, or male privilege, or to some degree middle class
privilege, because you're able to talk about them on the assumption that
these in some sense "should" be value neutral. But when you talk about
wealth, attractiveness, or intelligence, there is always an implied
subtext of "These are the privileges I have for being better than
you..." and that goes down about as well as you might expect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This results in a peculiar norm in a lot of lefty spaces where you are
supposed to acknowledge all your privileges &lt;em&gt;except for some of the most
impactful ones, which you are encouraged to downplay&lt;/em&gt;. I consider this a
tad suspect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More importantly, this results in a very distorted view of the world,
where people are not properly able to understand the advantages that
they have and others lack. I think it's important to understand these
clearly, both in order to have more empathy for others and the problems
they face, and also to understand &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-15-09:33.html"&gt;the nice problems to
have&lt;/a&gt; that
they bring you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What is intelligence?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The one I want to talk about today is intelligence. First I need to
convince you that intelligence is a real thing. Fortunately, you
probably already believe this really, but I'm going to spend some time
convincing you of it anyway so that we're on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;First, let's talk about IQ, because a lot of misconceptions about
intelligence come down to politically-motivated (in both directions)
misunderstandings about IQ.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You've probably heard a lot about how IQ is bullshit. This is generally
coming from a very well-intentioned place, but is wrong. There are many
exaggerated or incorrect arguments made on the basis of it, but IQ
itself is extremely well-validated psychometrics which serves a
genuinely useful role, especially for diagnostic purposes during
education. e.g. the reason I've had a proper IQ test was to diagnose a
learning disability that manifested as having &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; large
differences in my verbal and spatial IQs (these gaps have mostly closed
now), which has been very helpful for understanding my own thinking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;IQ is not a perfect measure of intelligence by any means, but nobody
serious claims it is. I highly recommend the book "Intelligence: A Very
Short Introduction" by Ian Deary for a review of the literature, and the
strengths and limitations of IQ. It's also just an excellent and very
readable example of good science communication.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So... given that, what is IQ?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, first off, IQ isn't really one thing. It is a family of different
IQ tests all of which are trying to do roughly the same thing and which
are normalised to the same distribution of scores, but are imperfectly
predictive of each other. That means that if you took two different IQ
tests, you would not expect to get the same result on each. This is
fine, because IQ is not intended to be an absolute measure of anything
in particular, it's a score that indicates general tendencies and is
usefully descriptive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What's it describing? Well, "intelligence" obviously, but what's that?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is, again, not entirely one thing. And this makes sense, right? If
you consider, say, a brilliant scientist and a brilliant novelist, there
are clearly different senses in which you'd expect them to be brilliant
- e.g. one would be better with words and attention to detail, one with
numbers and abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But, and here is the bit that is perhaps surprising, generally you would
also expect each of them to be better at the other's area of brilliance
than a typical member of the population. Although they are distinctively
brilliant in their different ways, they tend to be better at a whole
bunch of seemingly unrelated things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is the basic empirical claim that underlies IQ's utility: There are
a number of different tests we can perform that you might reasonably
consider "tests of intelligence" and, surprisingly, they are typically
positively correlated with each other. That is, good performance on one
test tends to predict good performance on another, despite the fact that
when you compare two people one person can do better on one and worse on
another.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A good analogy here might be strength. Someone who can bench press a
higher weight than me can probably also do more push ups than me, or
more reps in their deadlift at the same
weight (None of these are particularly impressive bars to clear, mind, because I
desperately need to start going back to the gym).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We could take a number of measures like this and turn them into an SQ, a
strength quotient, that measures your aggregate strength, and it would
function in very similar ways to an IQ as a general test of ability -
for tasks where you wanted someone strong, someone with a higher SQ is
typically likely to be better. For a specific strength task and two
people with relatively similar SQs it's not terribly surprising if one
is much better than the other, but when there is a very large SQ
difference you should at least be surprised when the person with the
lower SQ outperforms the larger. The world's best dead-lifter and the
world bench press record holder probably have quite similar SQs, but
sometimes one will be better at something and sometimes the other, but
they're both going to be better than me at almost everything strength
related.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;IQ is similar to our hypothetical SQ, but instead of things like bench
press weight, push ups, etc. we instead test things like memory,
performing complex tasks under time pressure, speed of generating
associations, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's also different from SQ, in that different things are empirically
true about it. e.g. one of the surprising and deeply frustrating facts
about IQ is that it mostly seems pretty stable over your lifetime. Some
movement is possible (and there is also just random variation based on
the particular test you take and what sort of day you're having), but
generally IQ seems better at reflecting some underlying hard to
influence capabilities than SQ, which responds well to exercise. It's
possible that there are some better tests of underlying strength
capabilities that are less amenable to training that would make for a
similarly stable SQ, but if so I don't know what they are.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The following are things I think are characteristically easier for
people with high intelligence:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly picking up new information and skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following complex arguments and instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Holding multiple things in mind at once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recalling relevant information to the current situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Facility with these things is something that people genuinely vary on.
Most of it improves with practice, but even the ones which improve with
practice tend to improve &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; with practice if you're naturally smart,
in much the same way that you get stronger with practice but your build,
nutrition, and general genetic makeup determines a lot about how well
that works for you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A wrong but useful analogy here is that smarter people are running their
brains on better hardware - e.g. faster processing, more memory, larger
hard drive, etc. If you're less smart, you can probably still do
everything that a smarter person can do, but at some point the
"software" becomes unusably slow to the point where it's too frustrating
to be worth doing, at which point you might either have to ask someone
else to do it or find an approach better suited to your current
strengths (e.g. by externalising more of the process when you hit the
limits of what you can do in your head).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Intelligence isn't everything&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I want to be clear, I don't think that your intelligence defines you.
Many people recognised as geniuses had fairly unremarkable IQs, and many
people with high IQs don't achieve anything particularly impressive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In my anecdotal experience, very few people are bottlenecked on their
intelligence, because people tend to naturally gravitate to doing things
that are about right for them, so the result is that people are often
doing jobs that someone much less smart than them &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be bottlenecked
on intelligence in, and someone much smarter than them would find very
boring, but there's usually a pretty wide band around any given job of
people who will basically be fine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(I think I wanted to include something about how intelligence also
doesn't determine your moral worth etc. I don't have anything non-obvious
to say here other than duh intelligence doesn't determine your moral
worth, and I'm not going to try something long about that now because it
will result in me not posting this instead)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Why am I telling you this?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am telling you this because, if you read my work, I assume you are to
some large degree like me. In particular I expect you are smarter than
average, possibly significantly so. I say this not to flatter you, it's
just really unlikely that you'd be interested in my
overly-intellectualised view of the world if that was not the case.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're also like me politically or emotionally, you've probably spent
a lot of time in denial about the significance of this, and as a result
being quite unfair to both yourself and the people around you. &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-be-smarter"&gt;I've
previously made strong claims about the irrelevance of empirical
questions about
intelligence&lt;/a&gt; and I
think these are still &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; right, but miss an important point: It's
valid to have this sort of growth mindset attitude to intelligence for
your &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; abilities, but when interacting with other people it results
in being unkind and pushy in ways that do not help you or them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are things you need to know about how intelligence affects you and
others when you are smarter than most of the people around you, and
because of the unspoken privilege nature of intelligence probably nobody
has ever really sat you down and helped you understand those things.
Certainly I was well into my thirties before I finally properly started
internalising this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People are often impressed with things I do - this newsletter and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis"&gt;Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; being major
examples - and I'm usually inclined to dismiss this. Anyone could do the
things I do, right? It's just a matter of hard work, a few tricks, and
an interest in doing it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do, in fact, think this is true to some degree. Given the right
training and willingness to apply themselves, I think most people could
do most of the things I do. Also I think it would be vastly harder for
them to do so, to the point where it might not be worth it. If I see
something instantly that you could see after sitting down for an hour,
or even a couple of minutes, it will often be worth me doing things that
it's not worth you doing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, this resulted in me being very impatient with
people. There were so many things that are so &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; that it seemed like
nobody could be bothered to do. Did they just not actually care? Were
they lazy?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Over time I learned to be less of a dick about it, and just got better
at explaining things to others, helping them out, and generally
expecting less of them. This was certainly politer than my younger
behaviour, but I don't necessarily think it was fairer, because there
was always a sort of premise that if I show you how this works then
you'll be able to do it as well as me, right?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result was a great deal of low grade disappointment on my end,
because the answer is rarely that they can do the things I am explaining
as well as I can. There will be plenty of things they can do &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;
than me, that play to their strengths and interests that I lack, but if
it's something I've spent enough time, interest, and effort on (even if
it felt this way) to get very good at it, chances are it's actually very
hard for them to catch up with me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the result is that over the years I've been, inadvertently,
rather discouraging to some people, by telling them that things are easy
that aren't easy, or that they can do things that realistically they're
never going to do.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"You can do it" is only a reassuring message if they actually can do it,
and if you've accurately conveyed the work that it takes to do it.
Without that, you're just setting people up for disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Chances are, you're probably making this mistake too. If you often feel
frustrated with the people around you for just not getting it, or for
being weirdly slow or bad at things you find easy, it's pretty likely
that they're not actually slacking off, those things are just much
easier for you than they are for them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;This sucks for you too&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you are significantly smarter than average, either uniformly across
the board or in some particular way, your mind literally works
differently from the people around you. There's a word for that:
Neurodivergence.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a general phenomenon of "gifted kid syndrome" that Twitter gets
in a furore about every six months where a bunch of smart kids talk
about how traumatic they found their childhood experience of that, and
the rest of Twitter is about equally divided between calling them
entitled tech bros (regardless of whether they are male or work in tech)
and going "Oh man this is great I haven't had such a good opportunity to
bully nerds in years". Generally there's a large subtext of "You're
talking about an advantage, therefore you don't get to complain about
the negative consequences of having that advantage for you, because
other people have it worse". I am, to put it mildly, not a fan of this
messaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general, one of the worst problems with problems that derive from
being smarter than the people around you is that they are almost by
definition unrelatable, and people try to make you feel bad for having
them. This is a central feature of what I call &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-15-09:33.html"&gt;Nice problems to
have&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we generally mean when we say "nice problem to have" is that
the &lt;em&gt;preconditions&lt;/em&gt; for having this problem are nice to have. i.e. you
cannot have this problem unless some other nice thing happens first.
This is not at all a reliable predictor of the amount of suffering
involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, by definition, "nice problems to have" are ones that
are not going to be shared by a lot of people (otherwise the
preconditions would just be normal behaviour and it wouldn't be a
nice problem to have). As a result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably won't be able to relate to it, because their
    lived experiences will be so different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will be envious of you for the nice thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus the defining characteristic about nice problems to have is not
that they are nice, but that you will be afforded no sympathy for
having them. Nice problems to have are the opposite of nice: They
isolate you from the ability to &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-should-complain-about-it"&gt;complain about
them&lt;/a&gt;,
which removes a major bonding activity with people who have not been
successful in the same way as you, and also causes you to feel worse
about the problems with those who do not share your burden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The distinguishing feature of high intelligence is that many things are
easy for you that are not easy for other people. On the one hand this is
great, on the other hand this has the knock on effect that you are
constantly under-stimulated, because the world is not designed on the
assumption that you find this easy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to get a sense of what this is like, imagine the following:
You, as you are now, are forced to attend class with a bunch of 7 year
olds doing their times tables. You are required to pay attention. If you
do not pay attention, you will be scolded for this. If you explain you
already understand the material, you will be scolded for disrupting the
class. You have no choice but to sit there, "learning" material you
thoroughly understand, day in day out, while those around you struggle
with it for reasons you can barely understand and wouldn't be allowed to
help with even if you did because that too would be disruptive.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much my experience of most classes growing up, and I
think that's quite typical for anyone reasonably smart, because classes
at school are generally not that hard in the first place. This results
in a lot of complaints that are not particularly well received because
they sound like normal problems. A lot of modern childhood just &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;
boring, so when someone complains about that experience it sounds like
they're complaining about a normal childhood
experience (Which, to be clear, is very reasonable to do in its own right. It's
&lt;em&gt;extremely bad&lt;/em&gt; that childhood is boring), and easy to miss that they are
describing a much more boring experience than you're imagining.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This piece is definitely a combination of two problems: It's very stressful
to write, and also I as usual had to do a lot of work explaining what I consider
very 101 level context. I wish I could write a piece where I don't have to
spend the first half of it explaining both "Opression is a real thing" and
"Intelligence is a real thing", but a lot of people need one or both of
these, and most people who don't need one of these very much need the other -
partly this piece was born out of my frustration with having to explain to
so many very well intentioned friends of mine that no IQ isn't actually fake
I promise.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is also a good example of explanation as defence - I do tend to over-explain
when I get stressed, on the hope that once people see how very reasonable I'm
being they won't be mad. This is exactly as bad a strategy as it sounds.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway I'd like to be able to write about things like this that are important
and stressful, but apparently I'm not currently able to do that. A pseudonym
might help, but it's not currently worth it to me to have writing that isn't
well integrated into my main body of work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Abstraction and concretization</title>
    <updated>2022-06-01T08:21:34+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Abstraction and concretization&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-06-01&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is another draft bankruptcy post. It's the only section I actually wrote
from a longer piece called "opposing mental motions".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is when you take something concrete and make it more
abstract. Dually, concretization is when you take something abstract and
make it concrete. You can also think of these as "Zooming out" and
"Zooming in", which also captures the feeling of them pretty well: As
you zoom out, you see more but can make out fewer relevant details. As
you zoom in, you can see the details clearly but lack the bigger
picture.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is when you ask "What general principles is this an example
of?". Concretization is "What are some examples of this principle?".
When you abstract, you zoom out. When you reify,&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't just a single step. You can zoom out to more and more general
situations, or you can zoom in on more and more specific details.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, here's a zooming in series:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replacing complex systems from scratch is a fraught business.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Often you discover that many of the specific features of the
    original system were much harder and less well understood than you
    thought they were (zooming in on the problem from "fraught
    business").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example in programming we've got the "second system effect",
    where second systems typically go
    badly and part
    of this is trying to recreate all sorts of tacit knowledge in the
    first system and maintaining bugwards compatibility with it for
    users' use case (This isn't the primary thing second system effect usually refers to, but it's still a thing that tends to happen in second systems).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;e.g. when Firefox replaced the original Mozilla web browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A specific thing that happened in that development...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Concretization here is a gradual move from general claim to specific
illustrative anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Concretization can fail. For example I think it's reasonable to argue
that Firefox is not actually a good example of the general principle
(it's also reasonable to argue that it is), and that maybe even second
system effect isn't really a good concretization because it tends to be
more about the second system trying to do too much (I think it's both).
A concretizing move is not unambiguously correct, and tends to work to
precisely degree that the audience finds it illustrative of the general
point.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Abstraction is often tightly coupled with looking for an explanation for
specific behaviours and responses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For a trivial example:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was watching Foundation. I hated it, it was super boring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why did I hate it? Well because it was mediocre. It was very well
    executed, but there was nothing interesting about it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is an instance of a general pattern where things tend to try to
    polish off their flaws without finding a real strength to emphasise,
    and I tend to hate that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Like concretization, abstraction can fail if you try to move to a
general claim that isn't actually true, or that the concrete claim
didn't demonstrate well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, I was talking about how I hate Rincewind the other day
(Rincewind is the protagonist of most of the early Discworld books. He's
the worst, and is the primary reason you should skip the early Discworld
books). I might have claimed that I hated Rincewind because he was a
protagonist who so clearly didn't want to be there and didn't want
anything to do with the events of the story. This claim doesn't hold up,
and you can see that it doesn't hold up by considering that Bilbo
Baggins (the protagonist of The Hobbit) also clearly doesn't want to be
there, but I like him just fine. If this were the correct explanation
for why I hate Rincewind, it would also work for Bilbo, so it cannot be
entirely correct.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(The actual reason I hate Rincewind is probably that he experiences no
growth or progress at any point. He starts contemptible, remains
contemptible, and at no point has any desires other than the return of
the status quo. The fact that he doesn't want to be there is &lt;em&gt;part&lt;/em&gt; of
it, but it's more like a refusal to engage with his world)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here you can use the two opposing motions to check that your move in one
direction is correct. You zoom out to the claim, then zoom back in to
another example of that claim to see whether it works in the same way as
the original. It doesn't, so the abstracting move must have been wrong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also fact check in the other direction by going "You have
claimed that this concrete thing is an example of this principle, but is
it not in fact an example of this other principle?". e.g. the
counterarguments to my use of second-system effect as an example of the
complex systems thing have this form: They claim that second-systems go
wrong for different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this way, the two conceptual motions provide a stabilising effect on
each other: The fact that we can move in one direction helps ensure that
we can move in the other direction safely, without the process getting
out of control or away from us.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How can we create healthy geniuses?</title>
    <updated>2022-06-05T14:14:58+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;How can we create healthy geniuses?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2022-06-05&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's another abandoned draft. I think this one was intended for the paid subscriber archives. It's clearly related to &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-do-we-treat-unique-talents-32a"&gt;How do we treat unique talents?&lt;/a&gt;, although I don't remember which one came first.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A recurring talking point in parts of where I hang out on Twitter is
something along the lines of "hypercompetence is a sign of trauma,
healthy individuals aren't hypercompetent". This seems to me to be
broadly true, but I think it's true for nonobvious reasons that I'd like
to explore.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;What is Hypercompetence?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hypercompetence is some truly unusual degree of expertise in some
specific skill. People are not, generally, hypercompetent in some fully
general sense, they are hypercompetent at something in particular. This
might be a professional skill (mathematics, writing, golf, etc), a
hobby, a social skill, or something else entirely.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think it is worth distinguishing hypercompetence from normal
expertise. Expertise is normal - you just have to work hard at getting
good at a thing, and eventually you will be. In the sense of &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/difficult-problems-and-hard-weeks"&gt;Difficult
Problems and Hard
Work&lt;/a&gt;,
for most people and skills, acquiring expertise in that skill is just
hard work rather than a difficult problem. The hypercompetent individual
however is somehow on a whole other level.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The distinguishing feature of hypercompetence is not that it is
&lt;em&gt;competence&lt;/em&gt; but that it is &lt;em&gt;hyper&lt;/em&gt;. You look at them compared to their
peers, and there is a major qualitative difference between them that
seemingly cannot be explained by normal skill development. I'm imagining
here someone like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s"&gt;Paul
Erdős&lt;/a&gt;, who was just the
most ridiculously prolific
mathematician.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Also a good example of "healthy people aren't hypercompetent". If the
price for being as good as Paul Erdős was that you had to be Paul Erdős,
I cannot imagine many people would take that deal.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is a diagram. It may not make much sense because I am bad at
drawing diagrams, but &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; find it helpful.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/genius-1.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this diagram imagine each vertical line is a person at their skill
level, so the width of the shaded area is proportionate to the number of
people at that skill level (not realyl to scale - the spike in the
middle is meant to be a single person, but I broadened it for clarity).
So you've got a normal level of expertise that gradually tapers off as
you go up, and then you've got the hypercompetent individual who is out
there on their own, as much above the normal experts as the normal
experts are above the average member of the population.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the following person is exactly as competent as the
hypercompetent individual in our above example, but the skill level
smoothly climbs towards their level:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/genius-2.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They are no less skilled than the hypercompetent individual, and they
are still the most competent individual in the population, but the key
difference is that they are surrounded by people who are only slightly
less competent than they are. There is a clear path to where they are,
with every step along the way populated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am fairly into the goal of helping everyone be the best versions of
themselves, so I much prefer the latter scenario. In the former, there a
sharp cliff where people have no real idea how to improve past other
than this one outlier who we don't know how to replicate. This seems
like a missed opportunity, and I would like to figure out how we can use
instances of the former to produce the latter.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Social Superpowers&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At least some hypercompetence, especially with social skills, is learned
in response to suffering. The Ferret argues that &lt;a href="https://www.theferrett.com/2021/01/28/your-superpower-is-a-compensation-for-old-trauma/"&gt;"superpowers" are
compensation for old
trauma&lt;/a&gt;
- if you're, for example, super attuned to other people's emotional
states, it might be because you grew up in an environment where you
needed to be hyperaware of people's emotional states to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This seems obviously bad (although the competencies arrived at this way
are often good). It can be worth treating the superpower as somewhat
diagnostic of things to look at, but the superpower doesn't just go away
because you fix the underlying issue, you've still learned how to do it.
e.g. I'm very good at explaining things, this turns out to be partly due
to a somewhat inaccurate belief that if people are being mean to me and
I just explain myself really well they'll understand and stop being mean
to me. This works about as well as it sounds, but it appears to have
prompted some useful skill development.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Social superpowers are hard to learn because we're incredibly bad at
teaching social skills, to the point of not even trying. I suspect this
is a scenario where the solution to the problem starts with trying
literally anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Why is genius bad so often?&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm more interested in the sort of hypercompetence that might reasonably
be called "genius", which I think tends to arise out of some amount of
baseline ability, adequate resources to make use of it, and some sort of
overriding obsession.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Of the three, I most clearly lack the obsession. I have a bit of an
internal debate as to whether this is missing the boat or dodging a
bullet, but I think for some of the reasons I discuss here my life is
the better for it. Which is not to say that I think I'd be a genius if I could be sufficiently obsessed, but I think I'm at least in with a chance)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Being vastly better at something you care about than people around you
who also care about that thing is very unpleasant. It triggers many of
the norms I described in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;The social obligation to be bad at
things&lt;/a&gt;, and
it is the very definition of a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-15-09:33.html"&gt;nice problem to
have&lt;/a&gt;,
isolating you from those around you who think they would love to have
your problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is bad because being socially censured and/or isolated is bad for
people. It's also bad because it means they don't have peers they can
readily discuss their problems with to get a different perspective on it
- the run-of-the-mill experts can to some degree serve these functions,
but they can't really relate to the hypercompetent individual that well,
and in many ways are probably more resentful of them than your average
run of the mill citizen who didn't care that much about being good at
the thing in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The other reason why it is bad is that it indicates that the
hypercompetent individual is someone who chose to do it anyway, and
that's probably not a sign of a healthy person.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A useful heuristic is that, to the best of their abilities and
resources, people get the life they optimise for. A genius "could" have
chosen to just go hang out on the beach and drink margaritas, but that
is not the life they chose. Instead, they chose a life which
deliberately isolates them, because they have decided that they care far
more about their particular level of competency than they do connection
with other people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More than this, they are so far past the typical level of those around
them that what happened is that they got to the point of social censure,
looked around them, and kept going because it was that important to
them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can, perhaps, imagine a healthy person rationally choosing to do that
given sufficient positive motivations to do this. If that's you, no
judgement. But for most people I don't think that's what's happening:
Instead they struggle to connect with others, and as a result they end
up (either deliberately or emotionally) concluding that they can't, and
so they set it aside.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think what often happens here is something akin to the protective
mechanism I described in &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia"&gt;Burnout as
Acedia&lt;/a&gt;. People
learn that caring about social connection is not rewarded, and may be
punished, so they learn "not to" care about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;Postscript&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know why this particular piece got abandoned. It's been sitting in the drafts folder for too long. I suspect it's simply that I don't know how to answer the question, and so didn't know how to wrap it up.&lt;/p&gt;
