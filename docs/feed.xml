&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2LYdFGs"&gt;100 Ways to Improve your Writing&lt;/a&gt; by Gary Provost, page 57:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no subject that cannot be made fascinating by a well-informed and competent writer. And there is no subject that cannot be quickly turned into a literary sleeping pill by an incompetent writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(This is as part of a section on style)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't true, and the fact that Provost thinks it's true is heavily informed by sorts of things he writes about,
which tend to be of more general interest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that fascination is a question of audience/writing fit. In a similar way that &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-08-08:53.html"&gt;you can't teach everything to a layperson&lt;/a&gt;, you cannot fascinate someone who refuses to be fascinated,
and some people are just never going to be fascinated by some subjects, and you may well need to write about those subjects (possibly because of the people who &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; going to be fascinated by it!).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's true that there is a fascinating story to be told about most subjects for most people, but often you shouldn't tell that one because it's not the important bit.
This reminds me of Zinsser's fucking terrible advice to tell a story about your engagement with the subject matter rather than the subject matter itself. There are circumstances under which that is the right thing to do, but those circumstances require me to care about you personally rather than the thing that I was expecting to learn.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's certainly true that any story can be told in a way that fascinates the maximum number of people who are capable of being fascinated by it, and that style has a huge part to play in that.
I'm in favour of good writing style, of course I am, and of not writing in a style that bores your audience, but it's important to not overstate the importance of style: You can't &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; people fascinated by your writing, except by writing about a subject that they will be fascinated by when properly told, and sometimes that's not the subject you're there to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Morality tests as self-fulfilling prophecies</title>
    <updated>2020-06-12T10:39:23+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Morality tests as self-fulfilling prophecies&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-12&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose someone is making a bad argument for a political point that you basically agree with.
Do you correct their argument?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probably not. Because if you correct their argument, you will be treated as if you disagree with their conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is not wrong of them per se: Almost everybody who corrects an argument does so because they disagree with the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why is that the case?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, because if you correct the argument you will be treated as disagreeing with the conclusion, which is rarely worth it unless you actually disagree with the conclusion, particularly in politics where disagreeing with the conclusion will usually be treated as a sign that you are a &lt;em&gt;bad person&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This seems a little self-referential (A because B because A because B because...) but in fact it's a very straightforward feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; disagree with the conclusion, it is worth correcting the argument. Therefore there is a core population of people who will always (yes this is a simplification. This is a toy model. Deal with it) correct the argument.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose about 50% of the population disagree with the conclusion, and initially the other 50% are all happy to. So if someone disagrees with your argument there's a 50% chance that they're a bad person. That's a reasonable chance, but it's not conclusive by any means. It creates a suspicion at best.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But now everyone who corrects an argument has to do a certain amount of work to pass the morality test: To demonstrate that they're not a bad person. Initially it's not much - "Look, obviously (conclusion), but I don't think this is the right reasoning because (correction). Instead (alternative)" will easily clear the bar.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But that's still a nontrivial amount of work. Say about 20% of the population who agree with the conclusion (i.e. 10% of the total population) just don't care enough to do the work. Now what you have is that 50% of the population will argue with you because they disagree with the conclusion, and 40% of the population will argue with you because they agree with the conclusion and disagree with the argument. Now, \(\frac{5}{9} \approx 56\%\) of people who disagree with your argument are bad people.
This increases the level of suspicion, and thus the level of work required to pass the morality test, and so slightly more people drop out.
Over time, thanks to this feedback loop, increasingly people only disagree with your argument if they also disagree with your conclusion &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; if they are prepared to put in a huge (in some cases impossible) amount of effort to call you on your bad argument.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this way the prediction (if you disagree with my argument you may be a bad person) has turned into a norm (only bad people disagree with my argument).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but I hate this. I am extremely in favour of knowing true things, and making sure arguments are correct is a part of that. If my argument is wrong I usually &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to know (although I'll admit that this doesn't mean that I accept correction gracefully all the time, especially if it comes from strangers, especially especially if it comes from strangers on Hacker News). This norm essentially means that I cannot trust anybody's arguments to be reliably truth tracking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I also hate it more because this pattern repeats over and over again. It's one of the driving factors of political polarisation - if you disagree with me on one political issue, that's evidence that you disagree with me on all the others (and thus are a bad person) etc. In general, people are not allowed to agree with the outgroup on anything, because that is treated as evidence that they are a member of the outgroup.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I would like to fix these feedback loops.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think for public discourse with strangers we're basically fucked, and there's no way to fix them right now except to set up much harder boundaries. The best we can do hope to do in most of these cases right now is to deescalate - politely rebuff people instead of shouting at them. It won't fix the problem but it might ease off on accelerating it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I do think we can do better with people we know, and I think this starts by accepting more of the burden of proof: If we suspect someone we know, especially a friend, of being a bad person, we should give them the benefit of the doubt. This doesn't require us to make excuses for them, but it does require us to be willing to do the work ourselves to figure out what's going on rather than immediately leaping to conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to get the ball rolling on that I will make the following prediction: if you're &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; willing to do that, chances are you're a bad friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Help isn't always helpful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-13&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3fiWsnC"&gt;Jonathan Strange &amp;amp; Mr Norrell&lt;/a&gt; by Susanna Clarke, page 355:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in London, where the Ministers knew as little of ships and seamanship as Strange, only one thing was clear: Strange had saved a ship, the loss of which would have cost the admiralty a vast amount of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In context, Strange has just saved a ship that had beached using magic. The magic in question resulted in completely reconfiguring the sandbeds of the harbour, which now have to be remapped. So, although he has solved the proximate problem, he has created a different one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This different problem is not necessarily a better one to have than the loss of the ship. 
It's not necessarily a &lt;em&gt;worse&lt;/em&gt; one either. Instead the two are &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html"&gt;incommensurable&lt;/a&gt;, because you can't decide between them without more context, and which problem is preferable to have depends on who you ask.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Solving the problem is very good for Strange's career because the problem he replaced it with is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Less visible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires a certain amount of expertise to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not the direct concern of the people with power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So although which problem is better depends on who you ask, when you ask the people with power over his career it's very clear which is the better one to have - they're not aware of the other problem at all!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Solving a problem by replacing it with one that matters less to people who matter and more to people who don't is often a winning (if selfish) move.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm put in mind of &lt;a href="https://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/"&gt;the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics&lt;/a&gt;, where we punish people for improving the situation in suboptimal ways more than we punish them for not doing anything about it at all. I disagree with a lot of the examples in the linked post, but it still feels like there is something to the concept.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wonder if this sort of problem is part of why we do that, and whether this is a rational thing to do after all: If we let people just swan in and "help", they will often do so in a way that is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html"&gt;legible&lt;/a&gt; to people who are not experts in what the actual problems are - partly because they themselves are not experts, partly because the audience who matters to them are not the people with the problems but the people watching whose opinions they actually care about. Punishing showy but suboptimal displays of helping by outsiders may result in strictly less help, but it might be worth it if it causes the people who &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; help to actually consult with people on the ground and ask what they really need.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uploading friendships to the cloud</title>
    <updated>2020-06-14T11:02:52+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Uploading friendships to the cloud&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-14&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm sad, so you get a sad post today, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I basically grew up on the internet. I did not have a lot of friends at school, and lived in a remote village so had few to no local friends, but I had people I talked to online, and that was (possibly literally) a life saver.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of these internet friends turned into in person friends, and many more of them I at some point met in person at least once. So the line between online and offline friendships has always been a bit of a blurry one for me.
There's definitely no hard and fast internet/offline friendship binary, but a very queer and shifting spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There was perhaps a bit of a lull in this during university, when I had a relatively constant source of offline friends, but even there I was quite active on university IRC networks and entirely legitimate university file sharing networks that we were definitely only using for sharing Linux ISOs. Many of those people were ones I met in person at the occasional meetup, but they were absolutely online-first friendships with an offline component.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I first moved to London, online friendships once again became centered, because I didn't know anyone here.
This became a bit more balanced as I started to make more offline friendships, but a combination of a long-distance relationship and starting to move more and more of my public brain onto Twitter meant that it was a more even balance between the two.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On top of this, a lot of my best offline friendships have always had a significant online component. We would have long-running conversations - on AIM (remember that?), IRC, google chat, or, more recently, WhatsApp. Almost all of my "real" friendships were maintained through the internet as much as in person.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of which is to lay some backstory for what was, to me, a rather surprising realisation: it turns out that for many of my friendships, the offline component was load bearing to a far greater degree that I had supposed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My ability to participate in some of the ongoing conversations that matter most to me has been evaporating recently, and those are ones with people who I was friends with in a way that was very much offline-first. We talked a lot on the internet, long before lockdown made that a necessity, but implicit in that was that it was a continuation of our offline friendship.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, many of my internet friendships and the conversations associated with them are doing just fine. They tend to ebb and flow with my mood, as always, but they're not evaporating in the same way because they were conversations without any strong implication that we would ever see each other in person - we probably would, and some of them are ones that I expect to turn into offline friendships when those become a thing again - but it was never something that formed a foundation to our friendship.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of this is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-19-17:31.html"&gt;that parts of us are missing&lt;/a&gt;, and perhaps it was those parts who were such good friends with each other. The rest of us were friends too, but they weren't necessarily as close. They're the sort of friends who only see each other at parties, or group events, and the pandemic has cancelled those group events.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But some of it, I have to admit, is that in many ways online friendships are just kinda low fidelity, and many of the things that you could overlook when you had the in person foundation become &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-11-14:47.html"&gt;trivial irritations&lt;/a&gt; that are enough to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html"&gt;put the brakes on&lt;/a&gt; the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don't expect this is going to &lt;em&gt;damage&lt;/em&gt; the friendships in question per se - we'll figure out a way through it, even if the way is waiting until after the lockdown is over to resume - but in the meantime there is definitely a sense of loss, and it's one that I think is highlighting for me how much more I needed in person contact than I had realised.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Surviving is good</title>
    <updated>2020-06-15T11:28:14+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Surviving is good&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-15&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3fiWsnC"&gt;Jonathan Strange &amp;amp; Mr Norrell&lt;/a&gt; by Susanna Clarke, page 578:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ranks of dead and wounded stretched away upon all sides as far as the eye could see. Simply being alive at that moment seemed, in some indefinable way, ungentlemanly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a classic example of &lt;a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2020/04/survivors-guilt/"&gt;survivor's guilt&lt;/a&gt;. In context, Strange and Captain Hadley-Bright have both survived the battle of Waterloo, but a lot of their comrades have not. This causes them to feel that their survival is, in some sense, inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Survivor's guilt is obviously very relatable right now, what with the pandemic going on, but it's a broader phenomenon, and one that I think we need to be very careful of. If we let survivor's guilt overcome us then we will often let the suffering of others drag us back down, preventing survival. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/quatoria/status/1253046971935469570"&gt;There was a good Twitter thread about this a while back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, surviving is good, and you should not feel guilty about doing good things. We want everyone to survive, and if we are to do that we need to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-03-09:56.html"&gt;get a handle on&lt;/a&gt; negative reactions to our own survival.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chatting with your consciences</title>
    <updated>2020-06-17T12:38:14+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Chatting with your consciences&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-17&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2X0wxe2"&gt;Voices: The Educational Formation of Conscience&lt;/a&gt; by Thomas F. Green, page 61:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The voices of conscience are various. There is no reason to believe either that they can be or that they ought to be always - or even very often - in agreement. [...] The aim is not to calm the quarrels of conscience, but to encourage their enlargement an their elaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I talked before in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-10-08:54.html"&gt;How to be a better person&lt;/a&gt; that what we need is not just a theory of ethics but a practice of it. Green's book, Voices, is the closest I have to a book on that subject.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Voices is a book about philosophy of moral education that neatly sidesteps the question of what morality &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be like by focusing on what it's actually like: Where, and how, do people learn their sense of moral?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Green argues that our experience of morality is structured around a number of different &lt;em&gt;voices of conscience&lt;/em&gt;, which we learn in different contexts and communities, which each provide a sense of reflexive appraisal about what matters. We have e.g. a conscience of craft which tells us to feel pride in doing good work and to feel guilt about doing shoddy work. &lt;a href="https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/2020/05/04/consistency-is-the-enemy/"&gt;Lisa has written about these voices in more detail previously&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've never entirely liked the metaphor of these consciences being a &lt;em&gt;voice&lt;/em&gt; per se. The experience of conscience is, first and foremost, a felt sense (in the Gendlin sense - a felt bodily experience of your emotions), rather than a voice. But it is useful to think of them as being their own self-contained entity. An aspect of the way we are, as Meg-John Barker &lt;a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/new-year-new-zine-plural-selves/"&gt;plural and in progress&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these "voices of conscience" can be thought of one of the various ways of being we can emobody at any given time, and we are constantly learning to be them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Green is, here, arguing that we should &lt;em&gt;embrace&lt;/em&gt; that plurality. If our conscience is intrinsically plural, then we should not expect those plural voices to agree all the time, so instead we should focus on getting them to &lt;em&gt;disagree better&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim must be to make those quarrels more incisive, more rational, more passionate,more perceptive, more discerning, and more expansive in their scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think for a lot of us engaging with our consciences is quite unpleasant, because we've developed very unhealthy relationships with guilt and shame.
As a result, this exhortation to spend &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; time arguing with our conscience probably sounds deeply unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I'm so big on &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html"&gt;the distinction between obligation and virtue&lt;/a&gt; is that I think part of the problem is that we overuse guilt in structuring our moral experience, which is why the process of engaging with morality is so unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Guilt is important - it's a felt sense of having violated an obligation - but morality has to go above and beyond obligation. Obligation is a baseline of adequacy. Ideally we would aim beyond adequacy and into &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-31-09:20.html"&gt;excellence&lt;/a&gt;, and we should &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-22-09:34.html"&gt;feel good about being excellent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a key part of this is that our model for these disagreements between our voices of conscience is wrong. What if a conversation with our voices of conscience can just be an interesting discussion - a pleasant chat? Our voices may disagree, but are fundamentally on side with each other - they are us, and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html"&gt;we should not hate parts of ourselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A disagreement between our consciences need not be an argument, let alone a fight, it can be a collaborative activity. If these disagreements are painful, we need better internal moderation skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Conversations in a public&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2X0wxe2"&gt;Voices: The Educational Formation of Conscience&lt;/a&gt; by Thomas F. Green, page 164:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I object to, in short, is not a hermeneutic of suspicion, but an entirely different thing that I believe we have created, namely a &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt; of suspicion, a culture of public speech in which it is simply assumed that because of role or position, because of the partiality or brokenness of reason, nothing any of us says can be entertainedat face value. [...] If I adopt that attitude, or if you adopt it, then our joint membership in a public, yours and mine, has come to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well of &lt;em&gt;course&lt;/em&gt; Green would say this, he's a philosopher. Honestly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ahem.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've largely avoided rereading the later chapters of Voices, where he talks about democracy and public speech, because I find it depressing how far from reality the ideal he's describing is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A thing I've found myself increasingly aware of is that expecting norms of honest inquiry to occur in public feels naive. I don't think this is something where the good old days were especially good, but it does feel like something that has gone from bad to worse over my lifetime. It's popular - and probably not entirely unfair - to blame social media, but the mainstream media is at least equally to blame.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of other people we can blame. The left will blame capitalism (it's the result of market incentives manipulating us this way), the right will blame identity politics (it's the result of people privileging identity and emotion over universal objective rational understanding of the world), probably everyone will blame political polarisation (sometimes without even meaning "too many people disagree with me"). &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So some greater or lesser degree &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-10-10:53.html"&gt;they're probably all right&lt;/a&gt; - all of these things and more make it very hard to pursue inquiry together, because everyone is at each other's throats.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My personal contribution to the list of reasons is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-12-09:45.html"&gt;morality tests as self-fulfilling prophecies&lt;/a&gt; - we are, at this stage, pretty primed to treat any political disagreement as a sign that the other person is our enemy, because our enemies will always disagree with us and our friends and allies have learned that it's not worth the effort of disagreeing with us.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I find this very frustrating, because a) Almost everyone (myself included) is wrong about almost everything and b) &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html"&gt;All knowledge is connected&lt;/a&gt; so often the way to figure out your problem is to go talk to someone who is a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html"&gt;nerd&lt;/a&gt; about a very different field.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To pick the least controversial example available to me, I've been reading a bunch of Christian philosophy and theology recently. Josef Pieper's work is foundational in my &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/life-as-nonproductive-act"&gt;Total Work&lt;/a&gt; series but is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; Christian (&lt;a href="https://books.rixx.de/reviews/2020/leisure-the-basis-of-culture/"&gt;Tobi's review&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to get a sense of that). As a result there's a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; we disagree on.
Green himself was a Presbyterian, apparently quite a devout one, and a number of his philosophical commitments appear to be grounded in that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of these disagreements are ones where we could probably talk them out and come to a more interesting synthesis. Some of them are probably ones where we will never agree and that's mostly OK (I'm basically never going to agree with an opinion that ends "and therefore Jesus").
Even where we disagree, the discussion has the potential to be enlightening (possibly simply be forcing us to clarify our own position).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some disagreements are rather more urgent than others of course. A lot of disagreemenets sound like "I need X to be safe" "You don't deserve to be safe, so you can't have X". Unsurprisingly, these disagreements don't go well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why they don't go well is that they're not the sort of thing that you can usually expect to agree on if you don't already agree on them. They're not really disagreements, they're conflicts, and you need either a &lt;a href="https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376"&gt;peace treaty&lt;/a&gt; or you'll have a fight (possibly verbal, possibly more literal).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Right now there doesn't seem to be any workable tools for getting to a peace treaty, certainly not without having a fight first, and this strikes me as a problem. My guess is that such tools have to start with assuming the possibility of a productive discussion, and that the culture of suspicion prevents us from assuming that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Green describes this as "our joint membership in a public, yours and mine, has come to an end". He's probably right, and I don't know what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Fake Olds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2TC15R4"&gt;Against the Grain&lt;/a&gt; by James C. Scott, page 213:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episodes of collapse are frequently succeeded by what comes to be known as a "dark age." Just as the meaning of collapse merits close and critical inspection, so the term "dark age" needs to be queried: "dark" for whom and in what respects? Dark ages are just as ubiquitous as storied dynastic highpoints of consolidation. The term is often a form of propaganda by which a centralizing dynasty contrasts its achievement with what it casts as the disunity and decentralization that preceded it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a saying that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it (actually the original quote is probably "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" - and yes I find it very funny that this quote is not properly remembered).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem with learning from history is that the very notion of "history" is a bait and switch.
We use it to mean two things:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stuff that happened in the past.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The study of said stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But the study of the past heavily over-represents the sort of thing that leaves stable records. We have access to the physical libraries of the past (except the bits that got burned) but not to the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-16-07:43.html"&gt;ghost library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Actual historians do, by and large, understand this of course, but to some extent there's only so much you can do: There's just vastly more information to study that represents what people with power wrote down. The best we can do with the rest is to read between the lines of that and infer what we can from archaeological remnants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're not a historian, you may never really have learned how to engage properly with history (I certainly didn't), and so may have bought into a lot of historical propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People are, I think, aware of the problem of modern propaganda - we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; journalists are mostly somewhere between highly selective and outright lying to us - but we tend to forget that historical records are mostly written by people who were doing the same at the time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is before you even get into the problem of modern propaganda efforts which are actively selecting from history to paint a particular narrative - a lot of the people telling us about the glories of the British Empire, for example, know full well how bad it was, they just don't want us to know that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Non-Experts and Status in Expert Communities</title>

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Non-Experts and Status in Expert Communities&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew"&gt;Talking About Machines&lt;/a&gt; by Julian Orr, page 93:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the use of the machines causes some ambivalence for the technicians. On the one hand, the only reason for having the machines is to use them, and the only reason for having technicians is that when machines are used they break. [...] On th eother hand, while technicians have a certain amount of their identity invested in the machines, the customers do not, yet the customers have the machines. Figuratively speaking, the technicians machines are in the hands of the heathen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is a common problem for people with technical expertise: Technical expertise is useful more or less only to the degree that it serves the non-expert, but &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-08-08:53.html"&gt;the non-expert stubbornly refuses to understand your expertise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to go from this to holding the non-expert in contempt: Looking down on the non-experts precisely because they are non-experts, despite the fact that your community of expertise is supported by the needs of the non-experts it serves.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this problem is particularly exacerbated by the fact that any area of expertise is a community of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html"&gt;nerds&lt;/a&gt; whose social bonds and status are centered on their area of expertise.
Status in an expert community is primarily (though not exclusively) defined by how good you are at the subject.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, a lack of expertise &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; low status. Non-experts, more or less by definition, are not experts and thus do not do well by these stats metrics. They are outgroup.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This necessarily creates a deeply ambivalent relationship between the expert community and the non-experts on which they are dependent: The people who are essential for their survival are also people who they have to adopt a different mindset from their usual one in order to properly respect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this feeds in to why usability work and user experience is so often considered low status within these communities: They force us to confront the congitive dissonance intrinsic in our dependence on those who are not one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Speech and Writing</title>

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Speech and Writing&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-23&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Heads up: I'm really struggling at the moment so I'm leaning extra hard on the fact that it's better to phone it in than not write)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2LZMM4W"&gt;The Art of Not Being Governed&lt;/a&gt; by James C. Scott, page 389:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Socrates believed that writing out his teachings effectively destroyed their meaning and value, whil it is just this instability, spontaneity, and improvisation of speech that made Plato so suspicious of drama and poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an endnote to page 230:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment a spoken text (a particular performance) is frozen in writing as preserved speech, it effaces most of the particularity of its origin - cadence, tone, pauses, accompanying music and dance, audience reaction, bodily and facial expression - any one of which might be essential to its original meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This connects up to a couple things for me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ursula Le Guin's "Telling is Listening" Which is well summarised by &lt;a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/21/telling-is-listening-ursula-k-le-guin-communication/"&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3emI4ud"&gt;Conflict is not Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, which claims that conflicts are generally better resolved in higher context higher bandwidth environments (ideally in person, if not in person on the phone, certainly not over text).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-14-10:26.html"&gt;My recent sadposting about friendships in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of writing. This should not be a surprise to you. But there does seem to be something fundamentally different about speech that is lost in writing (and vice versa), and I'm definitely feeling its lack at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
