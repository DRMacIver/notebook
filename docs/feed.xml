&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Pragmatic Problem Solving (aka Kludges)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1243110036341248000"&gt;On Twitter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guiding principle: If you can't solve a problem it's probably because you've not tried an ugly enough kludge yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our shower broke this morning. It's been running in a degraded state for a while, but the knob for controlling water flow finally stopped working entirely. We could get our landlord to fix it, he's pretty good about fixing things, but unfortunately we're under quarantine for another week so that's not a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I fixed it, of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From flatmate WhatsApp this morning:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shower is, in a sense, fixed now. It is probably a temporary fix and will likely break again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fix consists of two ingenious solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I returned the missing plastic gizmo to the inside of the shower knob (it came out a while ago and the shower was difficult to make work with it in, so I didn't return it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, in the event that you find you do not have enough grip strength to operate the shower in its current configuration (and you will find this), there is a tea towel hanging on the shower door and you should use that to grip the flow control knob and will find it much more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold, science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(This is, in fact, not science, but engineering. More on that in a later post).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I live with other very smart people, and I am not the most practically minded of souls, so why was it me who fixed the shower?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probably the answer is timing and coincidence as much as anything else. I'm sure someone else would have come up with something eventually. However I think I had a couple of straightforward advantages that lead to this being a thing I just shrugged and solved almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These were:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had some ideas of things to try and was prepared to &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/thinking-through-the-implications/"&gt;just hit things with them&lt;/a&gt; until something worked. I was originally going to try these two independently (either put the gizmo back, or take the knob off entirely and use the tea towel on the control shaft directly). Neither quite worked, but together they work fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn't care about fixing the shower, I just cared about being able to have one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Another flatmate adopted a bucket shower solution. I considered this unacceptable as long as the possibility of an actual shower existed)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html"&gt;often worth having bad solutions to demonstrate that a solution is possible&lt;/a&gt; but there's another case in which it's worth having bad solutions:
Often you &lt;em&gt;don't care whether the solution is bad&lt;/em&gt;, you just care that the problem is solved.
If you can't solve the problem, you might just be being limited by good taste.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Use a tea towel to operate the shower" is not a good taste solution. It's ugly, it's kludgy, and for now it's more than good enough, and I can assure you that the way my flatmates and I would smell after a few days without access to a shower is also not in good taste.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Competence is sexy</title>
    <updated>2020-03-27T22:37:11+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Competence is sexy&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Up front disclaimer: I am treating my personal experiences as universal in this post. I think the things I am saying in this post are fairly universally true, but there are obviously going to be people who experience this differently)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"Be attractive, don't be unattractive" sounds like trite advice, but actually it contains an important insight (or at least can be read in a deep way): In order to attract people you need to &lt;em&gt;not turn them off&lt;/em&gt; (don't be unattractive) and you need to &lt;em&gt;draw them in&lt;/em&gt; (be attractive).
Sexiness is what draws people in.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What is sexiness?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, to a large degree, sexiness is competence.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm serious.
You must have noticed how sexy people being good at things is.
This is a general thing. There's something intrinsically attractive about competence, and most forms of sexiness can be framed as competencies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(An example of a non-competency sexiness is that someone being attracted to you is also sexy, and is not a competency per se unless you're self-assured enough to view it as evidence of them having very good taste)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Experiencing someone as sexy is about fascination. You see something about them, and it draws you in, and makes you want to learn more about them and to explore it. It makes you want more of it. And nothing does this like looking at someone and noticing just how phenomenally &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; they are at something.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not all competencies are equally sexy of course. An amazingly good ballet dancer is (for most people) intrinsically sexy than an equally amazing chess player. But... the latter isn't &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; sexy, as long as you're well placed to appreciate their competence (If you don't understand chess you probably won't find it sexy).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But, even for most people who understand chess, the ballet dancer is probably still sexier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is true even independently of body type. If you somehow had someone who was both an expert ballet dancer and an expert chess player, almost everyone would experience watching them perform ballet as sexier than watching them play chess.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which competencies are perceived as sexy is highly individual, but by and large physical and emotional components of competencies are sexier than mental ones. The reason for this is pretty straightforward: For most (but by no means all) people, the physical and emotional components of sex take precedence over the intellectual ones, so this sort of competence is intrinsically more sexual.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You may, of course, be puzzled at the fact that I am talking about sexiness and ignoring physical appearance.
But actually physical appearance is a perfect example of what I'm talking about:
Physical appearance is &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much a competency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some people are, of course, unambiguously better at physical appearance than others. Some people really are just going to be &lt;a href="https://www.fvathynevgl.com/effortlessness/"&gt;effortlessly&lt;/a&gt; attractive. The rest of us have to work at it, to a greater or lesser extent.
However, this is a normal part of competency. Someone who is an amazing ballet dancer has worked incredibly hard at it, but they also probably have intrinsic advantages (strength, balance, body type) that others who are less good do not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How do you do competence at physical appearance? You do it by &lt;em&gt;performing an aesthetic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Different aesthetics will appeal differently to different people, but unless the aesthetic is utterly absurd (clowns aren't sexy no matter how good they are at performing the clown aesthetic. No shaming intended if you're into that, but I am never going to understand your mindset on this subject), performing it well is always going to be fairly sexy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Edit to Add: OK fine a friend has convinced me of the possibility that sufficiently competent clowning might be sexy too.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is why gender is such a big thing in most people's experience of sexiness: Aesthetics tend to be heavily gendered, and a great deal (not all, maybe not even most, but a major component) of what gender &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; for most people is conformance to a specific gendered aesthetic.
It would be an exaggeration to say that gender is intrinsically sexy, but performance of gender gives people many exciting opportunities for exhibiting sexiness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this is true even for aesthetics that are "wrong" for your gender. Competent performance of an aesthetic designed for a gender different from your own can be &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; sexy if you can pull it off, it's just easier for most people (both through training and through how the aesthetic was designed) to perform sexiness with an aesthetic that matches their gender. It's the performance of the aesthetic itself that is sexy, your appearance just defines how easy it is for you to perform any given aesthetic competently.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is at this point I must tell you a fact that I, as a card carrying bisexual, am all too acutely aware of:
in western anglophone cultures, women are on average substantially more attractive than men.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Before I continue, let me show you an extremely attractive man.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A spanish soldier" src="/images/spanish-soldier-2.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic/status/1241857598778900481"&gt;From a thirst tweet&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sexy, right? (Dear Spanish soldier man: In the extremely unlikely event that you're reading this, I'm very sorry for objectifying you in this way. Well... mostly sorry. It's in a good cause.).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why is he sexy? It's because he is performing an extremely masculine aesthetic &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; competently.
You don't need to be nearly this good at masculinity to perform it competently enough to be sexy. This is fairly upper tier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Also, if you read the comments, a lot of people are coming to an inescapable conclusion: He looks really gay.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is bullshit of course. Maybe he is, I don't know him, but just based on weight of numbers I'm going to say probably not. He certainly &lt;em&gt;reads&lt;/em&gt; as gay in our (western, anglophone) culture, but there's a very specific reason for this: We treat competent performance of most masculine aesthetics as gay (there are a few exceptions, but they mostly tend to be for celebrities or people who can pretend to be doing it on natural talent alone, and even then there's a bit of it).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The basic reason why women are more attractive on average is that they are better at performing an aesthetic than men are. This is for reasons that are actually quite bad, for both men and women but in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Women are punished (through misogyny) for not performing an aesthetic competently, while men are punished for trying to excel at it (through homophobia). The result is that there is vastly more cultural knowledge around how women can perform feminine aesthetics competently than there is for men performing masculine aesthetics competently, and also strong incentives for women to apply that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The incentive structure is bad (women should not be punished for not wanting to invest effort in their aesthetic if they don't want to), but the lack of widespread cultural knowledge for men on how to improve their aesthetic is also a major problem for us.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition to men being punished for success, everyone is punished for failure. The problem is that with aesthetic competence, trying and failing is much worse than not trying. This is especially true for men, not because men are punished more for trying and failing (this is something we are terrible about for people of every gender), but because men are punished less for not trying. It is safer for women to experiment with their aesthetic not because the punishments for failure are less, but because they start from a less safe place so the difference is less. It is more dangerous for men to experiment with their aesthetic not because the punishments for failure are greater, but because they have fewer resources available to them for achieving success.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result is that men are &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html"&gt;socially punished for trying to be good&lt;/a&gt; at sexiness, and exist in an environment that is mostly &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;extremely unsafe&lt;/a&gt; for them to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;experiment&lt;/a&gt;, and consequently there is a kind of massive cultural learned helplessness where men want to develop their aesthetic competency in sexy ways but honestly don't know how to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>On having different thresholds</title>
    <updated>2020-03-28T11:28:42+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;On having different thresholds&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-28&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Observe the following behaviours:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not expressing your wants or needs until they become essential for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not talking about your feelings until you can't cope with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not telling someone that their behaviour is bad until you can't deal with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not expressing an opinion until you are certain it's true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not articulating a thought process until you've fully understood it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These share the following major features:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are about where you set a &lt;em&gt;threshold for action&lt;/em&gt;. How X does a thing have to be before you do Y?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are very common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They are really really unhealthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For most people, lowering these thresholds will significantly improve your experience of and behaviour in the world.
That's not to say that the thresholds should be set at zero, and there are definitely people who have them set too low, but by and large the norms around where they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be set are much too high.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why? Well because if you don't do anything until something breaks then you will be constantly &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html"&gt;skirting the edge of disaster&lt;/a&gt;. For example if you don't express needs until they're essential, none of your non-essential needs are going to be adequately met. You'll maybe not be in crisis, but you'll be low-grade miserable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But, once you learn healthier behaviour and set these thresholds lower, you're going to run into a huge problem.
You've suddenly become &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html"&gt;illegible to other people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is this: Other people do not have access to your internal state. They do not know how X the thing is, they only know that you have done Y. This will cause them to assume that when you do Y, the thing is as X for you as it would be when other people do Y. This means that if you express an emotion, people will think it is a big deal. If you complain about a bad behaviour, people will think you must be really bothered by it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A concrete example is that I was trying Capoeira last year. About halfway through my second lesson I realised that actually this really isn't for me right now, and that I could cope with the rest of the lesson but it would be moderately unpleasant and I definitely wouldn't be coming back for another one, so I made my apologies and left.
I realised afterwards that people probably thought I was in quite a lot of distress, because that felt like a major move to them. I wasn't. I was just making what for me was a perfectly sensible decision, but most people wouldn't have made it until breaking point.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is why talking about feelings often feels like high drama / making a big deal out of nothing. It's not. Talking about feelings is great, and is in fact how you avoid drama and making big deals out of things that don't need to be. But because people are used to not talking about feelings until they absolutely need to be dealt with, when you talk about feelings before they need to be dealt with people assume you're making more of an issue of it than not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Differing thresholds are like &lt;a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/church-of-interruption.html"&gt;the church of interruption&lt;/a&gt;. People have incompatible conversation norms, and they don't realise that they do or don't know how to fluently speak the other's, so they are constantly miscuing off each other.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The solution, I'm afraid, is more talking. It has long been my stance that you need to have conversations about how to have conversations with people, and a crucial part of that is talking about what bringing things up means and how best to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything is a teachable moment</title>
    <updated>2020-03-29T22:24:23+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Everything is a teachable moment&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-29&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Previously I have written blog posts about:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/thinking-through-the-implications/"&gt;A cat who can open doors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-26-09:48.html"&gt;Fixing a shower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/08/how-did-you-get-started-so-quickly/"&gt;How to get started in a new code base&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Except that's not what any of these are about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They're actually about:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toolkitized thinking&lt;/em&gt; - how to apply things that you've learned in other contexts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pragmatic problem solving&lt;/em&gt; - how to let go of the desire to solve the problem properly and just solve the problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Efficient learning&lt;/em&gt; - how not to get distracted by &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-22-18:01.html"&gt;the impossibly large number of things to learn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Each of them are of course about both these things: Something happened, and by looking at what happened you can learn something generalisable about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Typically of course, you don't actually see a single thing and get the general insight, you acquire the general insight after seeing many different things, but often a specific example is exactly what you need to &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/"&gt;explain the point&lt;/a&gt;, possibly to someone else, possibly to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The important feature of these generalisations is that by doing this you learn beyond the specific circumstances you encounter and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758026/"&gt;experience the world richly&lt;/a&gt;, letting you draw on your past experience more effectively in novel situations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One way of looking at mathematics is that it's about taking a look at an argument and paring it down to its bare essentials and generalising it. Trying to take something hyper specific and turn it into a simple reusable principle that can be applied, by asking what about the problem actually matters.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our interactions with the world are like this too. Everything is a teachable moment, all you have to do is look at it through the right lens and use it to teach something.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Desire as a driver of growth</title>
    <updated>2020-03-30T23:37:46+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Desire as a driver of growth&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wrote before about how &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safety is the enabler of growth&lt;/a&gt;: The thing that allows you to grow is to be safe to experiment, so you can learn new ways of being.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is true as far as it goes, but it has a big problem: If you're safe, it's very easy to just stay where you are.
The possibility to grow exists, but you have no particular reason to take it, so you don't.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can see this in the stereotype of the spoiled rich kid (although often they're not exactly in safe environments either, so this is weak evidence. Consider it an illustrative example).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The basic problem is that growth is hard work. You have to want to do it. You have to actually &lt;em&gt;desire&lt;/em&gt; to grow.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One key to doing this is what I wrote about in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-23-15:52.html"&gt;life as an anytime algorithm&lt;/a&gt;: Designing goals so that you gain partial benefits as you go. This ensures that you're getting feedback on growth as you proceed, and it doesn't feel like &lt;a href="https://www.fvathynevgl.com/momentum/"&gt;a long hard slog with hopefully a reward at the end&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This isn't enough, because it depends on what type of progress you're making. In particular, I reliably find that progress that just makes things less bad doesn't have the right shape. 
The nagging urge is always there to backslide and just fall back to the old ways. The old ways weren't good, but they sure were easier, and stable, and stability is comforting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to create a desire for growth you need the changes you see to be an actively positive thing.
It makes you hungry for more, and the work feels less like work and more like achievement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Two examples where I have encountered this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In my various work on &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;emotions&lt;/a&gt; one of my specific goals has been around the experience of positive emotions. I don't just want to be less miserable, I want to be happier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I've been working on my diet. This means I no longer have a permanently upset stomach. That's great and all, but it sure is tempting to backslide because pizza is delicious. But... I must admit, I'm really enjoying the weight loss. I know, I know, body positivity, but I feel &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html"&gt;a lot better about my body&lt;/a&gt; than I have in some time, and that's really nice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You need to clear out the negative stuff too (more of my emotion work is on anxiety than joy, but the two feed into each other). It's important not to overfocus on the positive, but without the positive to drive growth you will often give up, and that means you end up doing less work on the negatives in total.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vampire bats as a model for flirting</title>

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Vampire bats as a model for flirting&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-03-31&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-29-21:16.html"&gt;everything is a teachable moment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html"&gt;all knowledge is connected&lt;/a&gt;, I'm now going to explain why the social behaviour of vampire bats tells us important things about flirting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am bad at flirting. I've got a lot better at it recently, but I am definitely not good at it. This is a post based on the process of my becoming less bad at it. Fortunately that's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarahdoingthing/status/877018612447313920/photo/1"&gt;apparently the perfect time to write about such things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, before we talk about flirting, lets talk about vampire bats. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/science/vampire-bats-blood.html"&gt;Vampire bats know sharing blood with friends is good manners&lt;/a&gt;, and this is how flirting works too. Well, flirting rarely involves the sharing of blood except for at very specific sorts of parties that I do not get invited to, but the general principle is sound.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The way vampire bats share blood between non-kin is that they start by grooming. If that's reciprocated, they maybe share a little bit of blood. If that too is reciprocated, they share more, and so on. They &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html"&gt;build trust&lt;/a&gt; by repeatedly offering slightly more than was previously offered, and waiting to see if it's reciprocated. This is called a raising-the-stakes game. The general strategy is described in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/28160"&gt;Development of cooperative relationships through increasing investment&lt;/a&gt;, although I confess to not actually having read it yet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is also how flirting works.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I previously wrote &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html"&gt;about sexiness and the process of attraction&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiencing someone as sexy is about fascination. You see something about them, and it draws you in, and makes you want to learn more about them and to explore it. It makes you want more of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Skillfull flirting is about mutually cooperating to escalate this fascination. You exhibit interest, to see if it is reciprocated, and you progressively dance your way through this back and forth, each of you expressing some interest and seeing how the other responds to it. If they don't, you back off (or at least stop escalating and stay at the currently comfortable level). If they do, you escalate further.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Eventually, if you both want it to, you've each drawn the other in enough that it becomes time to make the fascination more explicit, either by action (e.g. kissing) or talking about it, but this doesn't have to happen. Flirtation is about escalating fascination, but you don't have to keep escalating, you can just have fun with it at whatever level you like.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This can go wrong in three major ways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first is that you can just mess it up. Unskillful performance of flirting is incompetent, and thus unsexy, so may turn the other party off and lose the fascination. (If you're lucky and they're into you it may be adorable rather than unsexy, which has some chance of success. If I'm honest this is historically the most successful flirting strategy I have adopted).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second, is that you may lack the skills of picking up on interest. This is particularly true if you struggle to conceive of yourself as attractive (you miss interest that is there). It can also be true if you read interest that is not there (men are often bad at this - I've heard it said that men tend to overinterpret friendliness as flirting and women tend to overinterpret flirting as friendliness), but that tends to lead to unskillful performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third, and is the way I have personally failed at this until recently, is that you can be bad at showing interest you actually feel.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If attraction is fascination, then flirting is a process by which you create attraction. Usually it starts from some initial seed, but it can go down as well as up - if your attraction is very obviously not reciprocated, it will tend to diminish (this isn't always true, and there are some ways the opposite can play out, but they tend to be predicated on both a high level of initial attraction and the possibility in principle of it being reciprocated).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A consequence of that is this is that unless you are in some way extraordinarily attractive, unless you can demonstrate the attraction you feel towards others, they will probably not exhibit much attraction to you. If you find yourself in a situation where people just don't seem to find you attractive, consider whether that might be what's going on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The problem of deduction</title>
    <updated>2020-04-01T10:22:13+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;The problem of deduction&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-01&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1245261142966050822"&gt;I mentioned on Twitter earlier&lt;/a&gt; I am trying to reread books I've already read a bit more, because I'm failing to read new material. Not reading them cover to cover, just dipping in and refreshing my mind about interesting bits, seeing how it fits in with new information, etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The book I picked up to do this with this morning is Harman and Kulkarni's book &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2R2dL2z"&gt;Reliable Reasoning&lt;/a&gt;. Great book. Strong recommend if you've got the prerequisites (mild mathematical and philosophical sophistication) and are interested in the subject (inductive reasoning and what we can learn about it from statistics).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I opened it in the middle, decided I needed some refreshing on the first chapter, so went back to that and read it for a bit. On doing so I encountered a bit which caused me to go "Hmm. This is a good and powerful insight. I must remember it."&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is, however, a problem, which is that having that insight makes me realise that this is the &lt;em&gt;third time that's happened&lt;/em&gt;. So now I'm going to explain it to you so that hopefully I'll remember it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The official story: Deductive reasoning is when you go "All A are B. This is an A. Therefore it is a B". Inductive reasoning is when you go "All A I've seen so far are B. This is an A. Therefore it is a B". The former is obviously valid. The latter is obviously invalid.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-15:59.html"&gt;mentioned my favourite joke before&lt;/a&gt; but here it is again:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a joke about a planet full of people who believe in antiinduction: if the sun has risen every day in the past, then today, we should expect that it won’t. As a result, these people are all starving and living in poverty. Someone visits the planet and tells them, “Hey, why are you still using this anti-induction philosophy? You’re living in horrible poverty!” “Well, it never worked before...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem of induction is basically "Why is induction so weird compared to deduction?". Deduction is based on seemingly universally applicable principles, it's reliable and trustworthy. It really is true that if all A are B and this is an A it must be a B. That's just how logic works. In contrast, the inductive version &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; true - we're in the middle of a major &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory"&gt;black swan event&lt;/a&gt; right now, so we know damn well that sometimes the world surprises you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This book offers a surprisingly good answer: This question is a category error.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Deductive reasoning isn't a thing, because deduction is not a reasoning process. It is a logic of what follows from what. You can build reasoning on top of that, but you cannot do reasoning with it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose you believe all swans are white, and that this bird is a swan, and that this bird is black. This is, deductively speaking, an inconsistent set of beliefs. As it is inconsistent, anything follows from it. From a black swan it follows that eating cabbage grants you immortality. However, we would look quite suspiciously on this as a line of reasoning I hope.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The way the book puts this is:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From inconsistent beliefs, everything follows. But it is not the case that from inconsistent beliefs one can infer everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is true that if we believe all three of 1) All swans are white, 2) This bird is a swan, and 3) This bird is black,
then anything follows, but our inference procedure from here is not that we infer whatever we like, it's that we stop believing one of these things (or choose to remain inconsistent and are very cautious about what we infer from them).
Deductive logic doesn't give us any insight as to which of these things we should drop.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is still the case that a deductive argument from premises to conclusions is universally valid.
It is &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; that if all three of these things hold then cabbage makes you immortal. This is a valid deductive argument. But a deductive argument is not a reasoning process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The category error is thus that deduction is a process of argumentation about what follows from what, and induction is a process of reasoning of how we infer beliefs from information. These are not the same thing, and when you properly integrate deduction into the reasoning process what you find is that actually most of the things that were straightforward about it don't help you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, if you want to know why induction is so weird, the reason is that induction is the bit that lets you actually reason and infer things about reality, and the problem of deduction is that it can't actually do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Teleology is fake</title>
    <updated>2020-04-02T11:28:32+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Teleology is fake&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-02&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Tobi has written about &lt;a href="https://ramble.rixx.de/2020/03/30/on-origin-stories.html"&gt;origin stories&lt;/a&gt; and the importance of asking "What is this for?" instead of "Where does this come from?". He doesn't use the word teleology (the study of the purpose of things) but in the Adlerian psychology the post is based on that is what he's talking about.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've previously talked about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;the usefulness of teleology in understanding our emotional reactions&lt;/a&gt; and how understanding the purpose of an emotional reaction (its teleology) is important to adjusting it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both Tobi and my posts have the same aetiology (origin story), which is that we read The Courage to be Disliked (a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html"&gt;useful yet punchable book&lt;/a&gt;), which is in large part about using an understanding of teleology to change your social behaviours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I do not want to minimize the importance of this approach, which is very powerful and important, but it does have a critical problem with it: Teleology is fake. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html"&gt;Things don't happen for reasons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Questions to ponder:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why is this fence here?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why do giraffes have long necks?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why am I taking singing classes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The answer to all of these questions is: There isn't a good reason, but they're still important. Teleology is fake.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence"&gt;Chesterton's fence&lt;/a&gt; is the idea that if there is a fence in a field, you should not take it down unless you know the reason why it is there:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But "Why is this fence here?" is a slippery question. Do we mean it as a question of aetiology or teleology? "What is the use of this fence?" is a very different question from "Who put this fence here and why?". You might answer the latter, find out that it is for reasons that no longer apply, and tear the fence down, and discover that the local ecology collapses because now grazing sheep can get somewhere they previously couldn't.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There's a quote that is &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7659686-tradition-is-a-set-of-solutions-for-which-we-have"&gt;apparently from a sci-fi novel I've never read&lt;/a&gt;, by Donald Kingsbury:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems. Throw away the solution and you get the problem back. Sometimes the problem has mutated or disappeared. Often it is still there as strong as it ever was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, like Chesterton's fence, is an extremely conservative principle against reform that is also wildly optimistic about how easy reform is.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem is that tradition is not just a solution to problems we've forgotten, it's also a foundational layer on which we have built subsequent things. In the fence example, maybe the sheep came long after the fence, and were just never a problem before now. Changing the tradition invalidates foundational assumptions for many other things you were doing, possibly without even knowing they were there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now lets talk about giraffes. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-31-09:52.html"&gt;Animals are a good model for social behaviour after all&lt;/a&gt;.
Why do giraffes have long necks?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well there are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe#Neck"&gt;a couple possible reasons&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access to high up leaves which lets them outcompete other grazers by having more food supply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sexual selection (male giraffes fight by beating each other using their necks. It's terrifying).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to see predators from further away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All of these seem to be good hypotheses. Which one is the true reason?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well... probably all of them. Evolution doesn't actually do things for reasons. Evolution just tries random nonsense, and sometimes the random nonsense proves useful in ways that gives a net advantage. If something is useful for multiple weak reasons, that's just as good as it being useful for a single strong reason (potentially even better! More robust, more directions to develop in). So the "reason" giraffes have long necks might just be "All of the above, plus some things we didn't think of, plus these add up to being worth the cost".&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Evolution doesn't design things how a human designer sits down and design things (although in practice things created by humans are also designed in an evolutionary way, but the "mutation" process is a bit more directed) - it doesn't need simple legible reasons for what it does, it just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;tries stuff&lt;/a&gt; and sees how it pans out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Even this is of course too much of an anthropomorphisation of evolution, but it's a useful one)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Moving away from complex messy evolved systems that make no sense to instead discussing the human mind and its decision making, which obviously makes complete sense, I'm going to be taking singing lessons once the pandemic has lifted and I can find a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why? Well...&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm not very good at breathing and want to get better at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'm slightly embarrassed about how bad I am at singing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do a lot of public speaking and I'd like to be better at projecting as a result.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better voice control seems an interesting skill.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's a great embodiment practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It ties in well with Alexander Technique, which I'm learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be a good self-confidence boost to be able to be good at singing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those are the big ones, but there are more. But no single one of these is remotely close to enough to convince me to learn to sing. Any two or three wouldn't be. What's convinced me to learn to sing is that an accumulation of enough good, individually insufficient, reasons, has tipped it over to the point where the cost-benefit analysis is a clear net win.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is how everything works. Teleology is a useful lens to look at problems through, and should not be discarded, but ultimately if we think things are happening for a simple, clear, and comprehensible purpose, and that if we change them then nothing will change except insofar as it is related to that purpose, we're going to be in for an unpleasant surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anxiety vs Worry</title>
    <updated>2020-04-03T17:46:23+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Anxiety vs Worry&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-04-03&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is a distinction I've found useful recently: You are &lt;em&gt;anxious&lt;/em&gt; about something if the emotion attaches to the uncertainty in the situation, you are &lt;em&gt;worried&lt;/em&gt; about something if the emotion attaches to the possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;NB that this doesn't &lt;em&gt;perfectly&lt;/em&gt; track colloquial usage, but I think it works pretty well with it.
Also if you're not sure how to tell what the emotion attaches to, may I recommend &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2UWXQDL"&gt;Focusing&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's certainly possible to worry about things without being particularly anxious about them. Sensible precautions often work like this: e.g. I lock my door because I'm worried that if I don't people might otherwise come in and steal stuff, but there's no anxiety attached to that worry because it's just something I can act on to limit the chances.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can be anxious without worry in situations when all of the potential outcomes are positive (it's also possible &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misattribution_of_arousal"&gt;to mistake excitement for anxiety&lt;/a&gt; in these scenarios, but the anxiety can be real too). If one possible outcome &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anxiety and worry are far from mutually exclusive, and indeed tend to go hand in hand, but it is worth &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html"&gt;untangling&lt;/a&gt; the two conceptually,
and even where both are present they are still different emotions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, with COVID-19, I  am &lt;em&gt;worried&lt;/em&gt; about specific outcomes - harm to people in general, harm to people I love, overall negative societal effects, but am also also COVID-19 has more or less destroyed my ability to reason about the future, and that makes me &lt;em&gt;anxious&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the COVID-19 case the anxiety feels almost more like an &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html"&gt;existential feeling&lt;/a&gt; - there's not a specific thing I'm anxious about so much as a general sense that the unknown unknowns are dwarfing the known unknowns, let alone the known knowns (the unknown knowns remain huge given how ideological responses are being). The thing that is making me anxious is the uncertainty itself, not the bad outcomes possible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Reducing worry is often more tractable than reducing anxiety, because you can reduce worry by planning. If you have a scenario you're worried about, you can ensure that you're prepared for it (e.g. COVID-19 precautions, or talking through your concerns about a situation with the people involved before you get into it). I like Chris Hadfield's advice for dealing with worry, which is "Figure out the next thing that's going to kill you" - plan for the worst, and convince yourself you can handle it. Also often what you're worrying about is &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-03-09:07.html"&gt;outdated scenarios that no longer apply&lt;/a&gt;, so &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;learning to debug that can help with this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anxiety can be resolved by reducing uncertainty by making the situation more deterministic, but often that's not a good idea! &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;A certain amount of nondeterminism is often very useful&lt;/a&gt;, and many of the ways to reduce uncertainty do this by increasing the chances of failure (e.g. procrastination until it's too late to do a good job).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on any worries first, because often a lack of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; is the thing that makes uncertainty uncomfortable. Uncertainty isn't intrinsically bad, because if you're always certain you'll never learn anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See if you can reframe any of the anxiety. For example, you can be uncertain about the outcome but certain of your ability to handle it. Can you focus on that? Are there good things about the uncertainty too? Can you appreciate those as excitement? (This one rarely to never works for me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you've managed to get your anxiety down to a low enough level, it can be worth practicing a certain amount of discomfort tolerance. Anxiety isn't intrinsically bad, it may be telling you useful information about the world, so the correct amount of anxiety may be non-zero, and it's important to acknowledge that and be prepared to sit with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you've not managed to get your anxiety down to a low enough level, often me neither I'm afraid (I've got a lot better since I've acquired the "legacy code" tools). Consult someone with better advice than me and let me know what they said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will come as no surprise to the regular reader of this blog that personal growth is a bit of a thing for me right now.
It is unlikely to come as a surprise (given that I'm writing about growth and run a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html"&gt;support group&lt;/a&gt;) that I'm also keen to help others with theirs.
I've had a lot of good experiences on this front recently, many of which I owe to other people, and want to help pay it forward, both to my friends and also to random people on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the skills that seems most helpful in doing this is &lt;em&gt;being safe to tell things to&lt;/em&gt;.
People are mostly OK at the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html"&gt;desire&lt;/a&gt; part, and where they're not you can't really help them with that outside of a very close relationship, but everyone is lacking in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt;, and if you're to be able to provide people with a platform for growth you need to be able to extend that safety to them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is only one thing you really must do for this: Don't react badly, especially don't react judgementally, when people tell you things that they've been hiding about themself.
You need to be someone people can &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html"&gt;extend trust to&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, of course, extremely difficult in general. If someone confesses to some truly terrible crime, of course you're going to react badly to it, no matter how highly you think of them. It doesn't matter how much good faith you're extending, some things are just too much.
Fortunately, usually it isn't this bad.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm not yet sure what to advise on developing this skill, but some things that seem to help:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning good boundaries - being able to say "Actually, I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you with this" rather than trying and failing to help, or reacting defensively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;Learning to manage your own reactions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appreciating just how weird and diverse humanity is, and how many seemingly "unhealthy" things are actually very normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking whether it's &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-09-11:13.html"&gt;useful to have an opinion&lt;/a&gt; as to whether the thing being described is good or bad (if you're judgemental, will they stop doing it, or will they just go find someone who will encourage them to do it more?).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for the underlying pain, rather than focusing on how they're conceptualising a solution to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the communication skills from &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2RehhHl"&gt;the customer service survival kit&lt;/a&gt; to empathically defuse highly emotional communication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of these are, of course, the skills that one learns to apply as a therapist, but I'm hopeful that more people can develop them without retraining as therapists.&lt;/p&gt;
