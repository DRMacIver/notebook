&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the big reasons I’m doing daily writing right now is that I
quit caffeine. I have a very entrenched belief that quitting caffeine
makes it harder for me to think, and my evidence for this is that my
writing habit evaporates every time I quit caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is, as a factual matter, true that I stop writing when I quit
caffeine. That is a thing that happens. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-22-21:54.html"&gt;Writing
feels impossible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there is, it turns out, a great technique for doing impossible
things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to do the thing and fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-25-20:16.html"&gt;Figure
out the actual specific thing that went wrong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is my proposed default thing that goes wrong when you try to do
something that feels impossible: You think about doing the thing, you
are overcome with despair, you declare that it’s just impossible right
now, and then you flinch away from it and go do some dissociative
activity to self soothe from the aftermath of your terrible encounter
with the impossible.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Ask me how I know…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I’m big on &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html"&gt;necessity&lt;/a&gt;
is that it is a fix for this problem. If not doing something you find
aversive is an option, not doing thing is likely to be the option you
pick. If you’re definitely going to do the thing, you’re able to have a
genuine encounter with it without much fuss.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is, as a purely factual matter, not the case that it’s impossible
for me to write while not on caffeine. I write on WhatsApp or discord or
Twitter&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Well, not that one any more.&lt;/span&gt; all the time when off caffeine. The
actual mechanical act of writing is not that hard for me, and I often
say perfectly interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I could absolutely just open up the notebook, paste a comment from
discord, and write here every day without thinking. I could flip to a
random page of a book and copy out some text on here. I could write “I
am a fish” 500 times.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I am tempted to just do this one day to stop this from
being a hypothetical that I use and make it a real live possibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This means that the only thing that is preventing me from writing
here every day is that I am &lt;em&gt;choosing not to&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, step one: Choose to. Put daily writing in the category of
necessity. This forces me to admit that it’s not actually impossible -
it’s not actually even terribly difficult - it is just mildly
uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, in turn, creates encounters with the real problems that you’re
avoiding. Turns out, for me, I was struggling to find things that were
interesting for me to write about. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-26-19:06.html"&gt;It’s
not that I don’t know how to generate things to write about&lt;/a&gt;, but
those don’t feel interesting either.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of what’s happening here is that there are two major
relevant differences between my brain on caffeine and my brain off
caffeine:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With caffeine, my threshold for something seeming interesting is
much lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With caffeine, my thoughts are buzzing all around and generating
many different overlapping ideas all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So when I’m caffeinated, sitting down to write is basically just a
matter of waiting for an idea to come along, grabbing it out of the air,
and pulling on it until the thread of an essay comes out. On the rare
occasions I’m stuck, I use a random prompt to lightly prime the process,
but really even with the random prompts it works in part because my
brain is extremely prone to going “AND THAT REMINDS ME OF FIVE OTHER
THINGS”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I’ve actually got something to write about, it’s not actually
that bad to write. It requires dealing with a degree of discomfort and
anxiety about the process, but it’s just a little bit slower and more
halting, it’s not actually a big deal it’s just mildly unpleasant.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is more true for notebook posts than for full
fledged essays that I actually have to think about because of how much
I’m just basically writing down my chain of thought reasoning here
rather than trying to make a clear well-articulated point.&lt;/span&gt;. But sitting down and going “argh
fuck argh what do I write about?” is torture, partly because it’s
intrinsically unpleasant and partly because it triggers a whole “oh god
my brain is broken how can I live without caffeine? Woe is me, for I am
an abject wretch, deprived of that which gives my life meaning!”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway that sounds like a problem, David, have you tried solving
it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes I have, and it turns out it’s extremely easily solved, and the
magic was inside me all along because I’ve solved this problem before.
&lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/using-a-list-to-manage-executive"&gt;The
solution is to make a list of things I could write about&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve now
just got a little pad of paper on my desk with the heading “Things I
could write about”. When something comes to mind during the day that
seems interesting to write about, I jot down some slightly cryptic
phrase or sentence describing it, and when I come to write something I
look at what’s on the page. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-27-10:24.html"&gt;Censored
solutions&lt;/a&gt; was the first post I wrote using this system (partly
because writing &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-26-19:06.html"&gt;Creativity
on demand&lt;/a&gt; is what helped me spot it), and it’s been great since.
There are currenly 20 items on the list (including ones already
written).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The key thing that makes this work is that although it turns out that
I can’t currently generate ideas of what to write about at a rate that
means they just freely appear when I sit down to write, I sure generate
a lot of ideas in a day, the problem is that they don’t reliably stick
in my memory. As long as over the course of a day I generate more than
one idea to write about&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;It looks like right now I generate about five. It’s
likely that that will go down over time, but not necessarily - writing
begets more writing, because it gives you new things to think about.&lt;/span&gt;, the list will always be full.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I haven’t yet decided what to do when the list fills up.
I need to figure that out after finishing writing this post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point I’m making is not this specific technique is great
(although it is), it’s that this specific technique was in fact &lt;em&gt;very
easy to create&lt;/em&gt;, and I’ve tried and failed to write through caffeine
withdrawal multiple times before without creating it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I have actually tried a daily writing habit while off
caffeine before and it didn’t stick, but the way it failed was that I
was having a terrible time for other reasons and went back on coffee
before I ran out of backlog of ideas of what to write about.&lt;/span&gt;
Taking the option of not writing off the table and just making it my
problem to figure out how to do it any way forced me to figure out what
the real, specific, problem was, and do something about it rather than
just treating it as impossible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Necessity creates possibility: If you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do something,
probably you’ll figure out how.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Or, you know, fail horribly and die. But it’s hard to
fuck up a writing habit so hard you die.&lt;/span&gt; If it’s optional, it’s
too easy to make excuses as to why you couldn’t possibly do it.
Frequently those excuses will feel very real and plausible, but
evaporate as soon as confronted with a firm insistence that you try.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Win Streaking and Reliability</title>
    <updated>2025-03-31T19:10:48+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Win Streaking and Reliability&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-03-31&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to learn to win streak in Slay the Spire recently.
That is, get several wins back to back. I’m only playing on Ascension 1
for this, although I am trying to kill the heart (if you don’t know what
this means: Challenging but not the hardest mode).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty good at Slay the Spire. I’m not the best, not even close,
but I can semi-regularly beat it on the hardest mode, which is a
reasonably difficult achievement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I think one of the things this experiment is very much
demosntrating to me is that I’m playing it wrong. I’m very much engaged
in what you might call “vibe play”&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Get your mind out of the gutter.&lt;/span&gt;, where I’ve got a pretty
well honed intuition as to how to play it, and mostly follow that with a
little bit of tactical reasoning layered on top.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t produce many win streaks. I think on good days I win
maybe… 5-10% of my ascension 20 games, and probably somewhere in 40%
region for ascension 1. This is good for generating lots of wins, but
very bad for win streaking. At 40%, you’ll get some two-streaks,
occasionally three-streaks, and very rarely four-streaks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, I think, an intrinsic limitation on vibe play, and if I want
to actually win streak I need to start doing some sort of deliberate
play. The problem in slay the spire is that it’s very easy to learn ways
of playing that work very well if the game hands you gimmes. e.g. I
think everyone can beat the heart on A20 most of the time when they get
dead branch/corruption, but you don’t get that very often. If that
happens in, say, 1% of games, you can pretty easily vibe-play your way
to an appreciable win rate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A more general example, one that I think I’m prone to, is that it’s
very easy to take too many risks in Act 1, which will let you either get
very strong early on or die early on. This pretty rapidly gets you up to
a decent win rate where you win a substantial fraction of the time that
you don’t die in Act 1.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is definitely a little bit my problem, although I’m
more likely to die in Act 2 than Act 1 because Act 2 is the hard act.&lt;/span&gt;, but you have a high loss rate in
Act 1, and trying to fix that ends up actually lowering your win rate
because you’re not strong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’m trying to point to in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html"&gt;Necessity
Creates Possibility&lt;/a&gt; is that it’s very easy to end up in this
situation in real life too. It’s very easy to write when you’re in the
mood to write. That gets your win % on writing up to an appreciable
amount above zero. But if you don’t learn to write when you don’t feel
like writing, you end up very limited in how far you can improve.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem with moving off vibe play is that part of how you learn
vibe play is that it’s fun.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Stop snickering.&lt;/span&gt; Learning to step outside
that requires taking a more deliberate perspective on the game. I’ve
talked before about &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/record-yourself"&gt;recording
yourself playing&lt;/a&gt; to do this, but at this point I’m probably better
off actually breaking out pencil and paper and sketching out things
like:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s my goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I need to have achieved by floor X?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What probability do I assign to clearing this act?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And having a very slow methodical approach to the problem, where I
actually think about what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sounds boring TBH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is often a problem you get: You can succeed on pure
talent and enjoyment as long as things are going your way, but in order
to get really good you have to become reliable, and in order to do that
you have to figure out how to succeed even when the world isn’t
cooperating with you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You create rules, rules create you</title>
    <updated>2025-04-01T22:34:26+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;You create rules, rules create you&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-01&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I used to be a huge &lt;a href="https://www.beeminder.com/"&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; fan.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;In some ways I still am a huge Beeminder fan (certainly
I’m a big fan of the Beeminder team), I just happen to be a
non-practicing one.&lt;/span&gt; For
those who don’t know, Beeminder is a commitment system. You say “I’m
going to do this thing X times a week”, or “I’ll spend at most X hours a
week doing this”, or any other commitment about your life that you can
phrase as a metric.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the features of it I thought was extremely well thought out
was the way changing this commitment worked, which is that you can
change it at any time… and that change will take a week to take effect.
You’re always allowed to let future you off the hook, but the fact that
you don’t want to adhere to your commitment right this very minute
doesn’t get you off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can, of course, fail to uphold your commitment (“derail”), at
which point you pay Beeminder a previously agreed penalty.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;You can also email them with an excuse as to why you
should be let off the hook and an actual human will read it. Sometimes
they’ll just let you off the hook, sometimes they’ll say “Are you sure
that’s a good enough reason?” and maybe you’ll shuffle your feet and say
“No I guess not” and pay them or maybe you’ll stick to your guns.&lt;/span&gt; It
essentially makes the entire thing a sort of asynchronous negotiation
between your past and future selves. You can decide what commitments you
want to hold your future self to, and you can choose whether to break
your current commitments to your past self, but you cannot
&lt;em&gt;forgive&lt;/em&gt; those commitments. You are forced to either uphold them
or pay the costs of not doing so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is often a good model for trying to choose who to be,
even when it’s not as cleanly mediated by beeminder. When I talk about
&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html"&gt;necessity&lt;/a&gt;
it’s really this sort of commitment made by your past self that I’m
talking about. I don’t pay a financial penalty for failing to write
daily, but I do pay the emotional cost by knowing that I’ve let down
this thing that past me has committed to. At some point I will indeed
decide to stop the daily writing&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Typically I keep it up for 1-3 months before it starts
to lose the appeal, and that’s fine. But also… maybe I won’t. Maybe I’ll
just keep up the daily writing forever, possibly with some
modifications. Who knows?&lt;/span&gt;, but when that happens
it won’t be because one day I’ve just decided I have enough, it will be
because I choose to release future me from his commitments to
writing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probably at some point in that time I will fail to write some day.
That was nearly today, honestly. It’s not been a great day. This isn’t
the end of the world. Maybe there will be a good reason for it and I
won’t feel bad, maybe there won’t be a good reason and I’ll resolve to
do better, but the important thing is that I will acknowledge that the
rule was broken, and this was an important fact that I should respond
appropriately to, and that I should consider this fact when deciding
whether to break the rule or not - ask myself if I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need
to or if I could in fact do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think being able to choose rules that you follow and then stick to
them is very important, and you can use them to shape your emotional
reactions to things, and make aspiring towards be the sort of person you
want to be easier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One problem with the Beeminder analogy&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And part of why I don’t use Beeminder any more.&lt;/span&gt; is
that it makes it sound like the rules you follow are mostly about
creating negative emotions - they create ways of punishing yourself for
not upholding the ideal. I don’t think this has to be the case. For
example, with the daily writing there’s certainly a sort of “Ugh, I
guess &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html"&gt;I’ve
gotta&lt;/a&gt;” feeling because I know I’ll feel bad if I don’t do it, but
then I follow the rule it feels &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. There’s something very
satisfying about writing every day, above and beyond the general
satisfaction of writing. It helps elaborate a stream of thinking that
ties thought into life in a way that I very much appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also have rules that are more lightweight or even purely
positive. For example, one rule I live by is that I always say hello to
ducks if I see ducks. Why? Dunno. I started doing it, and I enjoyed it,
so I kept doing it. It’s not a rule I would feel guilty for not
following, but it is a rule I actively try to follow and it pleases me
to do so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think you can also do this by creating your own &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/fragments-intellectual-diy"&gt;idiosyncratic
categories and distinctions&lt;/a&gt; about the world. For example, I have a
mental category of “proper meal” which is basically defined by it having
to have three different vegetables in it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;There is a series of complicated rules and codicils to
this rule. For example: Neither mango, obviously, nor onions are
vegetables, but a dish which combines mangos and onions counts as one
vegetable. I’m aware this is a stupid piece of convoluted Byzantine
logic, but also it’s obviously correct so shut up.&lt;/span&gt; I
try to have at least one proper meal in this sense per day. I don’t
firmly commit to doing this, but a day in which I have at least one
proper meal feels better than a day in which I don’t, because I’ve
decided that this is the sort of meal I should cook.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things I learned with Beeminder is that you can’t add too
many rules at once. It quickly gets overwhelming and you quit the whole
thing in distress as your willingness to engage with the experience
collapses under the burden of it. But for many of the rules we live by,
the actual rule has long dissolved into being just… you. I occasionally
reach for the proper meal rule when I’m trying to figure out what to do
and having some explicit guidance would help, but mostly it’s just baked
in to how I cook and eat. I don’t even think about the ducks rule, I
just see ducks and I say hello. I brush my teeth twice a day, but that’s
not a rule at all at this point it just wouldn’t occur to me not to and
it would feel wrong until I fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But when you’re trying to shift who you are, particularly when you’re
trying to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-31-18:47.html"&gt;more
reliably be the sort of person you can only sometimes be&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes
a rule and the ability to commit to it is just what you need. You’ll get
the rules wrong sometimes, and when you do you absolutely need to be
able to change them without guilt, but before you can change them you
need to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-02&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One comment I got on &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-28-12:43.html"&gt;Behaving
as if you were trying to succeed&lt;/a&gt; was that the chicken thing was a
great anecdote. I liked getting this comment, and it made me think:
“Huh, yeah. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a great anecdote. I don’t have many of
those.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is sortof weird. It’s not exactly like I haven’t had
plenty of things happen to me that could take the form of great
anecdotes. When I try to think of examples, I do worry that the rate of
anecdotes per year has gone down a bit. I don’t know that this is
actually true. e.g. &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/using-what-youre-given"&gt;Using
what you’re given&lt;/a&gt; is basically me telling a bunch of recent
anecdotes.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Also my current life events are a rollercoaster of
between two and five very dramatic storylines right now, it’s just that
I’m in the middle of them and they involve other people’s privacy so I
can’t exactly share them easily in public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Certainly a lot of historic anecdotes feel… wackier. For example,
there was that time that I went to work in my pajamas. Or the time I
brought a giant frog to a wedding. More recently, I do get a lot of
mileage out of telling the story of my first date with my partners.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;It took me about halfway through the date to figure out
that I was on a date and until our second date to realise that neither I
nor they were poly prior to that point. I brought notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But… I don’t know, I’m not sure it ever occurred to me to tell the
chicken anecdote before, and it’s not exactly a big event.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of what’s going on is that I simply don’t think of my
life in terms of well packaged stories to tell, so anecdotes come up
when I’m talking or writing about something and I pull on the thread of
something and the next thing that comes out in the chain is something
that actually happened to me. The anecdote, in this context, serves as a
tool to solve a problem, but isn’t something I necessarily experience as
a primary thing in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not, I think, unrelatedly, I have very poor narrative memory. There
are whole swathes of my life that feel just… gone. I bet they’re not
though. I bet they’re just somewhere I’m not looking. Generally I find
when I pull on a thread of thought or memory there’s quite a lot there,
it’s just not indexed in a way that I easily have access to, but if I
actually go digging I recall quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example (look, an anecdote!) Dave and I were talking about our
seemingly-abandoned family D&amp;amp;D game the other day. We were vaguely
talking about resuming it, and he said something like “The first
challenge is anyone remembering what even happened in the last session”,
to which I said “God even I don’t remember”.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I am normally the one who remembers perfectly what
happened in the previous session and tells everyone about it at the
beginning of the session. No, I don’t know how this squares with my
belief that I have poor narrative memory either. I think it’s because
I’m using a different skill, the one where I just unwind the stack of
the conversation and perfectly tell you the thread of what we’ve been
talking about so far. It’s a weird superpower, but one I’m grateful to
have.&lt;/span&gt;
Then I said “hmmm… actually I do remember a bit, right. Jess joined us
for that one, right? She was a monk. We’d just finished making friends
with the flesh eating monster… Oh! And we fought the wizard we were
ostensibly there to rescue.” and then went on filling in more and more
details, each one becoming accessible as I remembered the bits adjacent
to it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I think this claim that I don’t have a lot of anecdotes I can tell
is just a skill issue. Or, not even really a skill issue, a habit issue.
All the raw material is there, and I can forge it into anecdotes if I
want to, I just don’t. I’m not really sure why not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of “why not?” is of course that not doing things is the default,
but there’s a sort of half formed feeling that this would be a good
thing to do, therapeutically speaking, and also just useful as a way of
improving my understanding of myself and my ability to communicate with
others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think just starting to tell more anecdotes will probably just
result in being much better at remembering and telling stories from my
life in general. Talking about my dreams almost immediately started
causing me to remember my dreams better, and I suspect this is similar -
once you direct yourself towards some external goal, the internal
experiences that you’ve been ignoring and need for this goal suddenly
rise to the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there’s also a sort of… fluency issue here. There’s a book by
Boris Shekhtman called “How to improve your foreign language
immediately” that I think about a lot despite not really working much on
speaking any foreign languages.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Technically, I speak Spanish, French, and German as well
as being a native English speaker. In practice, I speak all of these at
such a bad level that I’d be unable to claim with a straight face that I
really spoke them. I have been able to hold very basic conversations in
German in the past, did get an A at French GCSE, and have been the least
bad person at communicating with a waitress in Spanish in Mexico, but
that was more because I was able to speak Spanish badly with confidence
where everyone else around me was too shy. Oh, look, another anecdote.&lt;/span&gt; In particular one of the
things he recommends is developing “islands of competence” - areas where
you’ve gamed out a lot of the conversation in advance, where you’ve
memorised certain set phrases, filled in gaps of your vocabulary,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Practicing telling specific anecdotes feels like it’s adopting this
strategy more broadly, because it helps you find interesting talking
points about your life, and helps connect you up to a kind of fluency in
living that feels hard to access sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite sure how this will works. Consider this post more a
declaration to experiment than a well articulated thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Threads of existence&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-03&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a sort of running “joke” that I don’t have chronic fatigue,
I’m just… fatigued… chronically. Same with pain. Similarly I’m not
disabled, it’s just that sometimes I can’t walk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don’t have depersonalisation…&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Someone on discord recently described my writing as:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this guy has actually thought about the most basic mechanics of
“being a person in the world”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I have to do that is that I don’t feel very good
at being a person, and I’m having to figure it out the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I genuinely don’t think I actually meet many (any?) of the diagnostic
criteria for depersonalisation, but there’s definitely some sort of
background feeling of… what would it like to actually just effortlessly
be a person?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I’m not actually under any illusions about whether I am
or am not a person, and don’t actually benefit from external
reassurances about this. I’m factually clear on the empirical question
of my personhood. But it doesn’t feel like I’m very good at it, and I
don’t trust external observers’ opinions on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason I don’t trust external observers here is that I think
people rarely notice this about me, because I’m highly functional in
short bursts and in company, and so this adds up to seeming extremely
like a person in any externally observable scenario. But what that feels
like from the inside is that I &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/cohering-and-decohering"&gt;cohere&lt;/a&gt;
when observed or otherwise prompted to by circumstances, but can’t
easily do so under my own steam, and by default just collapse into a
sort of decohered blob that left to its own devices will just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html"&gt;drift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;If you’re wondering if that’s related to the
aforementioned definitely-don’t-have-chronic-fatigue, yeah me too. I
don’t know how much, or in which direction, but it sure seems like a
thing. If you’re thinking “gosh David, it sure sounds like what you’re
describing is depression”, yes I know. I did start by talking about a
key major common diagnostic feature of depression after all…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It feels, almost, like having a self that lacks object permanence.
It’s not there if someone isn’t looking. And, sure, it’s relatively
stable in its characteristics each fresh time it exists, because it’s
made out of roughly the same parts each time, but it still went through
a phase of not existing and coming back into existence, with a
discontinuity between those two things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this seems bad, and I’d like to fix it. In some ways, fixing
it is probably a core feature of my project, although I don’t know that
I’ve done a very good job of that.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I tend to think of my personal project as something more
like “Figure out how to be less depressed”, but it has a lot of details
and pulls in a lot of life in general&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of fixing it is just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-31-18:47.html"&gt;finding
more circumstances in which I can cohere&lt;/a&gt;, but I think another bigger
part is a sort of… OK, sometimes you’re not a person. That’s normal.
Going to sleep for example is a legitimate interruption in continuity.
Or sometimes you just lose yourself in flow in a way that interrupts
your conscious awareness of what’s going on, or get drunk, or are ill,
or… You get the idea. If an enduring sense of self requires full
continuity, you’re never going to have it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the analogy to object permanence is interesting, because the
thing about lacking object permanence is that &lt;em&gt;objects actually are
permanent&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that they cease to exist for you in between
viewings doesn’t actually mean they cease to exist. What’s lacking is
not a permanence to their existence, but your sense of that permanence
as a unified thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of how you build that unity between different fragments
of yourself across time is that you start to build links between them.
Part of what’s interesting about the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html"&gt;attitude
to commitments&lt;/a&gt; I’m trying to foster is that it is casting a link
forward in the future between yourself now and who you will be. Being
able to do this reliably starts to help you feel that you will continue
to exist in the future as an entity contiguous with who you are now. You
are, but actually being able to act on that helps you &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html"&gt;alieve&lt;/a&gt;
that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-02-18:59.html"&gt;telling
stories about your life&lt;/a&gt; is likely the other part of this link, and
it’s part of why I’m trying to figure out how to explore that. In much
the same ways commitments cast a link forward, a story casts a link
backwards, connecting up who you are now with who you were then.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre has this notion of “narrative identity” as the
thing that constitutes selfhood. I haven’t read much about this, though
I do keep vaguely intending to. I guess I’m gesturing at something like
that, although I’m not sure we’re talking about exactly the same sort of
thing. I don’t think you can view self as wholly constituted by
narrative, but I do think that narrative is perhaps an important tool
for building a skeleton that a self can grow on top of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why do you do things?</title>
    <updated>2025-04-04T22:03:21+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Why do you do things?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-04&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I recently watched CJTheX’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZg_36utl2w"&gt;6 Shapes of God&lt;/a&gt;.
I don’t really know if I recommend it or not. I recommend giving it a go
and either you’ll find it weirdly compelling and watch it or you won’t
want to watch it and both are fine outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things they talk about in it, partially rooted in some
work by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt that I’m passingly familiar
with&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And really should read more of. I find Frankfurt a bit
dry, but generally he makes really interesting points about stuff I care
about.&lt;/span&gt; is that there’s a sort of division
into “instrumental ends” (e.g. I want to make money) and “terminal ends”
(I want to have fun) that is natural to make, and also is sortof fake,
because we also take on our “terminal ends” for instrumental reasons: If
we didn’t have something to strive for, we’d be bored.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think I might here be conflating Harry Frankfurt’s
views with Elijah Millgram’s “On being bored out of your mind”, but in
my defence that paper is specifically building on Frankfurt’s work
here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Frankfurt&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think.&lt;/span&gt; introduces the idea of “maeutic”
ends - ends which lead to you taking on other ends in order to achieve
them. e.g. you might want to be happy, but merely aiming directly at
happiness doesn’t work. In order to achieve happiness, the most
effective means is to find something that can matter to you for its own
sake, and then &lt;em&gt;sincerely take that on as an end&lt;/em&gt;, and happiness
will emerge. e.g. when deciding what to do with your life, you might
decide to be a doctor because that seems fulfilling to you, but you
can’t be a doctor to seek fulfillment and expect to be fulfilled, you
need to decide that being a doctor genuinely matters. You might later
decide that it is not if it’s making you miserable and lacks the
qualities that matter to you, but in the moment your day-to-day reason
has to be about the end of &lt;em&gt;being a doctor&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;being a
doctor in order to be fulfilled&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The instrumental/terminal distinction is still useful though, it’s
just important to understand that “why?” answers are weird and
defeasible and necessarily incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why did you eat that cake? Because it was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you look at this as a sort of pure logical syllogism sort of
answer it’s obviously ridiculously incomplete. You’re not committing to
eat all delicious cake. You’re just highlighting that deliciousness was
among the most salient reasons to you for why you ate this particular
cake.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think you can tie yourself into logical knots very easily this way,
but it’s still worth asking why you do things, and you can ask why those
are motivating, etc. Some of htese will feel like more purely
instrumental, some will feel more purely terminal, although most of them
it will feel like you’re missing something.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I notice if I try to come up with a list of things that you get at
the end of a chain of whys it doesn’t bottom out at a very large number
of different things. e.g. I might come up with something like:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because it was interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because it was funny&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-27-10:24.html"&gt;because
I was horny&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because it made something less distressing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because it was comforting in some way&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;because &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html"&gt;it
needed to be done&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;out of some sort of weird hard to understand compulsion&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I often experience “because it was delicious” and a lot
of adjacent things like this actually. I find deliciousness initially
motivating but it seems hard for me to treat this as the actual reason I
continue eating the food. It might be the reason I go back for seconds.
There’s something weird going on here though.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(This is in no way a complete list)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I notice that it’s relatively hard for me to treat something like
“because it would bring me joy” as a motivating reason. Like… there’s
something vaguely uncomfortable about that as an answer and I feel like
I almost deflect it with some sort of interstitial answer. Like… if you
asked me why I pet a cat, I would answer “because it was cute and
fuzzy”. It feels somehow unnatural to take the next step. I don’t know
that that’s necessarily wrong, in the same way that you &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/a-good-start"&gt;feed the beggar
because he is hungry&lt;/a&gt; but there’s &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; weird there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think as useful a tool of introspection as “Why?” is, I think maybe
the problem is that it assumes a causal structure that isn’t there. You
don’t do things for reasons, reasons are things that you use to explain
the things you do. In some global sense, the reason you do anything is
that it fits naturally into the practical activities of your life at
that point there. You can do the dishes for a reason, or you can just do
the dishes because the dishes are what you do now. You can pet a cat
because it brings you joy or because it is cute and fuzzy or you can
just pet a cat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Reasons for doing things aren’t something you need when your life is
functioning fluidly on its own. They’re a tool to fix when it isn’t, or
to communicate something to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But… I do often find myself casting around for reasons. Why? Partly
because it’s interesting, but mostly because I am distressed and I am
trying to understand so I can reduce this distress.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the other fake but useful distinctions in this space is the
idea that you have ends and you have means and they’re distinct. You can
partly see this because of all the implicit constraints on means - you
can achieve an end you want through undesirable means. You could argue
that this is just that you have multiple ends, and that’s certainly
true, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to think that using a
particular means can be an end in itself. If you’ve got a skillset, you
probably enjoy using that skillset, and that enjoyment is pretty close
to a terminal end.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This comes up a lot in programming. e.g. I like using the union/find
algorithm to solve problems. Why? I think it’s neat. I enjoy using it.
Like yes I &lt;em&gt;suppose&lt;/em&gt; you could describe that as my terminal end
being joy, but it feels weird to reduce my motivations here. The joy
&lt;em&gt;describes the action&lt;/em&gt;, it doesn’t justify it. It’s the same as
petting the cat: I do it because the cat is fuzzy and the algorithm is
neat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I’ve been thinking about this at the moment is that I’ve
been noticing that there are all sorts of… free floating wants, that
seem attached to a specific action but has no really clear “why?”
associated with it. I think this is what David Chapman calls a &lt;a href="https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/hunting-the-shadow"&gt;velleity&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;It would be uncouth to point out that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velleity"&gt;this is a Western
philosophical term&lt;/a&gt;, a discipline that David Chapman &lt;a href="https://meaningness.substack.com/p/four-kinds-of-philosophy-i-dont-do"&gt;heartily
rejects&lt;/a&gt;, so I will.&lt;/span&gt; but if so it feels like they are
more complicated than I’d believed. A velleity is “the lowest degree of
volition, a slight wish or tendency” but this doesn’t feel necessarily
like it’s small. It can feel actually quite strong, but it feels strong
in a way that doesn’t motivate action, or that feels like it requires &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html"&gt;permission
to act&lt;/a&gt; in some way that’s missing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example I’ve been &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-02-18:59.html"&gt;thinking
about anecdotes recently&lt;/a&gt; and one of the problems I keep running into
is &lt;em&gt;when do I tell anecdotes&lt;/em&gt;? And why? My writing is actually
fairly peppered with anecdotes, but that’s fine because they’re there
with a clear purpose. But… I don’t know, can you just &lt;em&gt;tell people
things&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It feels like I’ve got a bunch of free floating anecdotes that are
just sitting around with nothing clear to do. Means without an end
attached to them. And I… think I’d like to share them? Or do something
with them in some way?&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;The complexity here is that there are a bunch of them
that are quite embarrassing or shameful, either for me or for other, and
I don’t know that sharing is what I want to do with them but if it’s not
then I &lt;em&gt;don’t know what to do&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; They feel like they have to be
&lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; something, but I don’t have a thing that they’re for.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Harry Frankfurt thinks we take on final ends for instrumental
purposes to avoid being bored, but I think there’s another missing move:
Sometimes we take on ends because we’ve got these means we want to use,
and we choose them first and then set out to find reasons to use
them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Except… I don’t think I know how to do that. Maybe the answer is just
make them into art, but I struggle with art at the best of times.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is very much a half completed thought, but I think I need to
finish here and sleep on the rest of this.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Sources, Sinks, and Flows&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-05&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a very computer flavoured self help post.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here, for you, is a very useful general organising principle, which
is that there is &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt;, and there are things that &lt;em&gt;operate
on stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Those things, can themselves, be stuff, although usually
at any given level of representation it’s not helpful to consider them
as part of the stuff being operated on.&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sources&lt;/em&gt; are where stuff comes from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sinks&lt;/em&gt; are where stuff goes to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flows&lt;/em&gt; are what guide stuff between sources to sinks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Often there are different types of stuff. For example, you can view
&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-23-21:48.html"&gt;my
process for cleaning the kitchen&lt;/a&gt; through this lens, and two types of
stuff here are &lt;em&gt;clean dishes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Which further subdivide into &lt;em&gt;wet clean dishes&lt;/em&gt;
and &lt;em&gt;dry clean dishes&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s mostly not relevant for the
process which stops at the point where they’re left for air drying.&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dirty
dishes&lt;/em&gt;. The sink is, appropriately, a sink for dirty dishes, but it
is a source for clean dishes. One flow in this system is the process of
washing up by which dirty dishs go into the sink and clean dishes come
out.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I’m being a bit imprecise about all of this. I recommend
not worrying about it.&lt;/span&gt;. There are plenty others -
e.g. there are sources of dirty dishes on the dining room table, which
flow to sinks (not usually the literal sink) in the kitchen, from which
they flow through to one of various sinks for dirty dishes (literal sink
or dishwasher) until they come out clean, from where they flow to one of
various sinks for clean dishes (a place where they can sit to air
dry).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Often when systems don’t work it’s due to badly designed flows.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example: I talked in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html"&gt;Necessity
creates possibility&lt;/a&gt; about my new writing habit of writing down ideas
when they occur to me, and then using that to figure out how to write
about.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;That habit has broken down a bit and needs tinkering. I
didn’t, it turns out, have a good system for what happens when the list
fills up.&lt;/span&gt; What was happening there is that I
had good sources of ideas to write about (they come to me when e.g. in
the shower, on a walk, doing the dishes, talking to someone), but there
was no reliable flow directing them to the sink for ideas to write about
(the actual process of writing). Introducing a written list creates a
reliable flow by means of adding a persistent queue to the process
rather than just having them fall into the sink of forgetting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the problem is that there are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; good flows, but
they direct your sources to sinks you don’t want them to go. e.g. I find
&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html"&gt;drifting&lt;/a&gt;
often plays out this way. If I block myself from the internet, suddenly
all the attention that was flowing into the “idly scrolling” sink stops
vanishing down an infinite black hole of distraction and I just start
spontaneously doing stuff.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And sometimes the problem is that there aren’t any sinks that you
want things to go into, and as a result the source gets stifled.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of what I’m pointing at with the “means and ends” thing in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-04-13:33.html"&gt;Why do
you do things?&lt;/a&gt; is that sometimes you need to create outlets that
don’t exist. A sink that it feels actually worthwhile for your source to
flow into. Like… imagine having all of these shower thoughts and
conversations and so on and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; writing about them? I bet most
of you don’t have to imagine very hard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One easy fix I have access to is creating discord channels. I
suddenly got much better at remembering my dreams when we created a
#dreams channel to report dreams into&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I’ve lost the habit of this. I should get back into
it.&lt;/span&gt; I’ve created an
#anecdotes channel for similar stories about our lives to see if that
helps here.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;NB neither of these channels are publicly accessible to
people immediately joining the discord.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In general it seems to me that there’s something unhealthy about
getting &lt;em&gt;stuck&lt;/em&gt;, and that if you have a regular source of stuff
being produced, it needs an outlet to go somewhere. If you don’t find
somewhere good for it to go, it will probably go somewhere bad instead,
and that seems like a problem worth solving.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Good queues and bad queues</title>
    <updated>2025-04-06T16:49:05+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Good queues and bad queues&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-06&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a follow on from &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-05-10:53.html"&gt;Sources,
Sinks, and Flows&lt;/a&gt; and won’t make much sense if you haven’t read
that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An important category in this model is the &lt;em&gt;queue&lt;/em&gt;. A queue is
basically a source/sink pair in which stuff does nothing except enter
and then leave at some point later.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some queues are bad. Some queues are good.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let me give you some examples:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A literal queue of people waiting to be seen at the shops is a
queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The kitchen cleaning example has a lot of queues in it. Dirty dishes
first move to the kitchen counter, where they are buffered until they
are ready to be washed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The place where I write down ideas for what to write is a
queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That growing pile of papers that has been sitting ever grosing
somewhere in your office waiting to be dealt with is also a queue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The storage space in your attic that you keep putting stuff into
because you don’t want to get rid of it but also don’t actually know
what to do with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m using “queue” somewhat informally here, as not all of these have
FIFO (first-in/first-out) behaviour. Please ignore that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of these are very good because they improve the smooth flow of
stuff through the system. You can get one task done before having to
start on the next (imagine if you had to hand wash every dish as soon as
you brought in into the kitchen rather than cleaning the dining room
table first), and you can parallelise it (one person brings stuff into
the kitchen, another washes).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The place where I write down ideas is also a pretty good queue, but
it has a significant problem viewed as a queue: If the only way for
items to come off the queue is for me to write something, items are
being added to the queue much more often than they are being removed
from it, and this causes the queue to grow unboundedly. My current
solution to this is that when the list fills up I start a new list and
copy over anything from the old list that still feels appealing.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;What will happen when all of the ideas seem appealing?
Uhhh. Hope that doesn’t happen and if it does I guess I’ll just have to
write more?? Problem for future David.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The pile of papers on your desk? That’s a bad queue. That queue is
not working.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The two key features needed for a queue to be a good queue are:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over some suitable period of time, as much has to come out of the
queue as go into it. If you put stuff into a queue to “deal with it
later”, &lt;em&gt;you have to actually deal with it later&lt;/em&gt;, and the rate
at which you deal with it must exceed the rate at which you create stuff
to deal with.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://x.com/tef_ebooks/status/875882791954677761"&gt;sage tells
us&lt;/a&gt;, basic queueing theory means that queues either grow unboundedly
over time or reliably return to empty.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The queue must either &lt;em&gt;not fill up&lt;/em&gt; during the gap between
stuff entering it and stuff leaving it, or you must have some graceful
process for handling when it does.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Which can, and sometimes should, be “you start throwing
stuff away”. This is particularly a good idea for queues of ideas of
stuff to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The biggest failure mode of queues is that often we introduce queues
into our flows because &lt;em&gt;we don’t want to deal with the thing&lt;/em&gt;.
When this happens, the queue makes our life worse rather than better,
because instead of having a small amount of stuff we don’t want to deal
with we have a large amount of stuff we don’t want to deal with, and the
result is our environment acquires a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-06-09:51.html"&gt;fnord&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, for stuff you’re perfectly happy to and have the
capacity to deal with, a queue is often extremely useful for smoothing
out irregularities - when you’ve got large bursts of production and a
more gradual process of consumption such as in the dishes example - or
to more efficiently connect up sources and sinks so that stuff doesn’t
get lost and you don’t have to frantically multitask between different
types of activity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Digital object permanence</title>
    <updated>2025-04-07T18:07:38+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Digital object permanence&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s a useful idea that I often mention in passing and people seem
to find helpful but I don’t think have ever written down as its own
thing: Digital objects lack object permanence. That is, they stop
existing for you when you stop looking at them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I first started noticing this with the kindle. I like having physical
books partly because I can stop reading them and they don’t go away and
I can pick them up later. It’s vastly easier for me to juggle multiple
physical books because they’re real in a way that digital ones aren’t.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is aggravated by Kindle’s library management being
terrible, but I think it would happen even without that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve also noticed this with e.g. things I’m writing. I have many half
abandoned Google docs with stuff I was writing that felt very important
at the time and I just forgot. In contrast, I relatively rarely forget
e.g. the essay I’m currently writing on my typewriter, because it’s
right there.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Conversely though, I also never really forget about this notebook, or
my substack to a lesser degree. I sometimes go long periods without
touching them but that’s not because they stop existing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think they have two major features that cause this to happen:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rather than being objects, they are &lt;em&gt;places&lt;/em&gt;, and they are
places where I put public content, so an object that goes into them
&lt;em&gt;doesn’t need&lt;/em&gt; to be permanent to me, because it exists for other
people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They act as &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-05-10:53.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;sinks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
for when I want to think about something in writing, so there is a
natural thing that keeps me coming back to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Digital places that act as sources also seem to have a degree of
permanence, but I find it often feels like it achieves that permanence
through addiction. You’re not going to forget that Twitter exists,
because you’ve got a twitchy reflex to click it. I think you probably
&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have digital places that act as non-addictive sources, but
it doesn’t seem to be where we’ve ended up in design space. I think some
of that is just incentive following, but it does feel genuinely
hard.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I like to think my discord server managed to be a place that achieves
its permanence through non-addictive means, but based on some people’s
relationships to it I’m not sure it does that reliably.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Python has structural pattern matching</title>
    <updated>2025-04-07T18:38:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Python has structural pattern matching&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-07&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hey, did you know that this works?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;pre class="pycon"&gt;&lt;code&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from dataclasses import dataclass
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; @dataclass
... class Foo:
...     x: int
...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; @dataclass
... class Bar:
...     x: str
...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; match Foo(x=1):
...     case object(x=x):
...         print(x)
...
1
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; match Bar(x=1):
...     case object(x=2):
...         print(x)
...
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; match Bar(x=1):
...     case object(x=x):
...         print(x)
...
1
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; match Bar(x=1):
...     case object(x=2):
...         print(x)
...     case object(x=1):
...         print("hello!")
...
hello!&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can use “object” as a matcher to match based solely on whether a
value being passed in has a particular field, and you can descend into
the value of those fields with other match expressions as you like.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Python’s pattern matching is a bit of a weird beast because those
things in a case expression that look like constructor parameters are
nothing of the sort, they’re just fields, and they don’t have any
relationship to the type you’re matching on, they’ll just bind to the
field of that name on the object being matched &lt;em&gt;and the match will
fail if the field is not present&lt;/em&gt;. The type you’re matching on is
just an instanceof check&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/python-abc/"&gt;that instanceof
check doesn’t have to be a real instanceof check and can use ABC
subclass nonsense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and doesn’t have anything to do with
the fields.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, you can use an &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; match (or any other
type you want to match on) with arbitrary fields, and the match
expression will check for the presence of the field.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In some sense this is how it &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to work but it was
non-obvious to me that it would work. In particular I thought there was
a decent chance that this would raise an AttributeError if you tried to
match on a missing field, but instead it handles that and you get
arbitrary structural pattern matching on record types if you want
it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can’t decide if this is cool or gross or both. More importantly, I
can’t actually think of a case where I’d actually need to use this
feature. I think it definitely straddles the line between “weird hack”
and “genuinely interesting language feature”, but because we’ve mostly
moved away from duck typing in Python, and because most of my usage of
pattern matching is effectively with closed algebraic data types, I
can’t actually immediately think of many places I’d want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
