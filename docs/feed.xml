    <title>Speech and Writing</title>

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Speech and Writing&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-23&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Heads up: I'm really struggling at the moment so I'm leaning extra hard on the fact that it's better to phone it in than not write)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2LZMM4W"&gt;The Art of Not Being Governed&lt;/a&gt; by James C. Scott, page 389:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why Socrates believed that writing out his teachings effectively destroyed their meaning and value, whil it is just this instability, spontaneity, and improvisation of speech that made Plato so suspicious of drama and poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an endnote to page 230:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment a spoken text (a particular performance) is frozen in writing as preserved speech, it effaces most of the particularity of its origin - cadence, tone, pauses, accompanying music and dance, audience reaction, bodily and facial expression - any one of which might be essential to its original meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This connects up to a couple things for me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ursula Le Guin's "Telling is Listening" Which is well summarised by &lt;a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/21/telling-is-listening-ursula-k-le-guin-communication/"&gt;Brain Pickings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3emI4ud"&gt;Conflict is not Abuse&lt;/a&gt;, which claims that conflicts are generally better resolved in higher context higher bandwidth environments (ideally in person, if not in person on the phone, certainly not over text).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-14-10:26.html"&gt;My recent sadposting about friendships in the cloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm a big fan of writing. This should not be a surprise to you. But there does seem to be something fundamentally different about speech that is lost in writing (and vice versa), and I'm definitely feeling its lack at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Books are never finished, only abandoned</title>
    <updated>2020-06-24T15:54:22+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Books are never finished, only abandoned&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-24&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've been noticing something recently: I've really started to resent lending books.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If a book is good enough to be worth lending, it's probably good enough that I want to keep referring back to it, and lending out a book means that for an unknown amount of time I will lack access to the book.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I've turned this feeling into a feature rather than a bug: It helps me find out which books I really value. If I lend a book out to someone and find I'm missing it, I buy myself a new copy and now I have a loaner copy as well.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(This of course doesn't work that well with expensive or hard to find books. I'm going to solve that problem by not lending those books)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why this has been interesting to observe is that it highlights some of my changing relationship with books. Instead of books being a thing to complete, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1266093917885337600"&gt;books are part of an ongoing process of reading&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that I have read a book cover to cover doesn't necessarily take it out of that process. If nothing else, it just moves it into fodder for the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html"&gt;writing practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-09-10:23.html"&gt;A Book is a Tool for Thinking With&lt;/a&gt;, so a book is only done when you no longer need that tool.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This might be because:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You've acquired a strictly better tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You've internalised the book so well that you no longer need the tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're no longer interested in having the thoughts it enables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In my experience this is roughly in increasing order of likelihood for books that were worth reading in the first place: You can hit the point of diminishing returns, but you rarely hit the point where you &lt;em&gt;can't&lt;/em&gt; get anything out of a book, you just get to the point where you're no longer interested in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Subsetting Life</title>
    <updated>2020-06-25T21:24:23+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Subsetting Life&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-25&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2AVz40p"&gt;Perplexities of Consciousness&lt;/a&gt; by Eric Schwitzgebel, page 125:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look around a bit. Consider your visual experience as you do. Does it seem to have a center and a periphery, differing somehow in clarity, precision of shape and color, richness of detail? Yes? It seems that way to me too. Now, how &lt;em&gt;broad&lt;/em&gt; is that field of clarity? Thirty degees? More? Maybe you are looking at your desk, as I am. Does it seem that a fairly wide swath of the desk (a square foot?) presents itself clearly in experience at any one moment, with th shapes, colors, textures all sharply defined? Most people, when I ask them, dendorse something like that. They are, I think, mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is as part of a broader segment where he walks you through to realising just how small your field of clear vision actually is - it looks larger because your eyes are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade"&gt;saccading&lt;/a&gt; all over the place because vision is actually an &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-30-13:17.html"&gt;active process of looking&lt;/a&gt; rather than a passive receipt of a visual field, so you are implicitly using that to fill out a wider visual field.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is an example of one of the interesting things I've been coming to terms with over the last year or so of personal development: the fact that people can be and usually are completely and totally wrong about their internal and embodied experiences.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(As per usual when I say "people are completely and totally wrong" I want to emphasise that "people" here &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; much includes me. I've been learning this in large part through becoming fractionally less wrong about my internal experience)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think one way to understand why we are like this is to think about C++.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(Yes, sorry, this is going to be another &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;slightly strained analogy for how brains are like software development&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;C++ is an utter monster of a language. It's large, it doesn't so much have sharp edges as is made from razors glued together, and it's built out of a gradual accretion of features that made sense at the time. The &lt;a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68564.html"&gt;latest C++ standard&lt;/a&gt; is 1605 pages long and also costs CHF198. Nobody actually knows the whole thing because every time someone understands C++ in its completion their brain is eaten by creatures from the outer dark. Fortunately this has only ever happened twice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And yet people write C++. A lot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How? Well they don't even try to write using the whole thing. They pick a subset of it that is sufficient for their use case and is more or less manageable, and they use that. Often they don't even fully understand the bits they use, because they've got weird edge cases that basically never crop up - or don't crop up at all unless you use features of the language outside of your subset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Typically when people write C++ together they mostly agree on which subset to use - different people will have different preferences, but they'll largely agree because when you use something your coworkers particularly dislike (even if it's only in "your" code) they'll start having angry words with you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How are these subsets chosen? Generally, conservatively. You write the bits you know. If someone tells you about something neat you might start using it. If something bad happens, you learn to avoid that feature in future (often without really being able to explain why or what happened). Sometimes standards are codified, but more often than not there is a rough and messy process of negotiation and fumbling around that leads to something approximating a reasonable dialect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Thus, even though every C++ project potentially has the entire vastness of C++ available to them, in practice they spend the entire time in a tiny subset of it that they are able to cope with.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One thing this subsetting enables people to do is have &lt;em&gt;completely wrong&lt;/em&gt; mental models of how things work that just happen to work on the subset in question. Often this is a very good thing because these models are so much simpler than the reality. Thus as well as not requiring you to understand things you don't use, subsetting helps you understand how to work with the bits that you do use by letting you ignore complexity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Until it doesn't. The nice thing about these simplified but wrong mental models is that they're simple. The bad thing about them is that they're wrong. And then you run into an edge case and discover that the reality is so much weirder and more broken than you had assumed it to be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, to cut a long analogy short, life is like this: The actual range of human experience and capability is much more weird and complicated (and, occasionally, richer and more powerful) than we typically experience it as, because trying to keep on top of that all the time is impossible. Instead we've each learned a little subset of the possibilities available to us that mostly works, and we develop these simplified and wrong models of how it works (such as treating our field of clear vision as a simple static view of our visual field rather than a dynamically updated approximation to it). These work great, until some jerk does philosophy to us and forces us to confront how complicated being a human being actually is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trying out this thing called Hypothesis</title>
    <updated>2020-06-27T12:29:02+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Trying out this thing called Hypothesis&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-25&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Hey, you know that software called Hypothesis?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;No, not &lt;a href="https://hypothesis.works/"&gt;that one&lt;/a&gt;, the one for &lt;a href="https://hypothes.is/"&gt;web annotation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nibrasibn/status/1275811352225906688"&gt;nibras was expressing an urge to comment inline on her friends' websites&lt;/a&gt; and I pointed out that this was exactly what hypothesis is for.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then it occurred to me that it &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be nice to expose that sort of functionality directly on the notebook. It turns out you can embed hypothes.is directly into your site with an easy piece of javascript, so now I have. You should be able to add annotations to any of the notebook posts (it's not currently turned on for posts as they show up in the index, because I couldn't be bothered to figure out how).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You'll need an account on &lt;a href="https://hypothes.is/"&gt;hypothes.is&lt;/a&gt; to make annotations, but you should be able to see any public annotations people make. The toolbar on the right will give you some options to control what you see.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To make an annotation just select some text, click "annotate" and write whatever you like there. It should hopefully all be fairly intuitive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Find a forking path</title>
    <updated>2020-06-26T11:20:47+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Find a forking path&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Suppose you come to a fork in the road. You know that one arm of the fork goes to an amazing destination. The other arm goes to a mildly disappointing destination - nothing too terrible, but the knowledge that you've ended up there instead of the great destination will make you sad. There's nothing to distinguish which path is which.
What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Well, based on my keen and insightful observation of human behaviour, I can tell you what you probably do:
you sit down in the road and cry about it, and eventually waste away and die never having taken either path.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is a bad plan. Just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html"&gt;flip a coin and use that outcome&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to spend a little while looking for clues first, you can do that, but picking either path is ging to be better than being paralysed for choice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even if you end up in the destination of mild disappointment, you're still better off than before. You've &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;learned something&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe that knowledge will help you find the great destination? If nothing else you could walk back up the path and go the other way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Coming to forks like this is generally a really good thing, because:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both outcomes are a strict improvement on the status quo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the outcomes is really really good, easily justifying the effort of taking the fork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But because we are unable to deal with the fear of making a bad choice, we end up with decision paralysis instead, the very idea of taking the fork becomes scary, and we either sit down and cry or (more often) pretend the fork doesn't exist and back away slowly down the path.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, forks like these are &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-06-09:51.html"&gt;fnords&lt;/a&gt; - things that we learn not to see, because seeing them makes us feel obliged to deal with them, so every time we run into them we flinch away and pretend not to have noticed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A neat consequence of this is that we are probably &lt;em&gt;surrounded&lt;/em&gt; by high value opportunities that we are ignoring. If you start looking for this pattern, you'll probably find all sorts of examples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple I'm aware of:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html"&gt;Trusting people (slightly) more than you're sure they're worthy of&lt;/a&gt; - either you learn more about how trustworthy they are, or you improve the level of trust between you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-03-09:56.html"&gt;Approach emotions with the intention to act on them if they're accurate&lt;/a&gt; - either you improve your emotional response or you improve your understanding of the situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html"&gt;Entertain bad ideas&lt;/a&gt; - either you learn more about the problem or you figure out how to make the idea good.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another one I'm currently entertaining but haven't really committed to: I think it might be possible to break habits that you don't like by trying to actively enjoy that habit. If you have a compulsive snacking problem, say "OK. It's completely fine for me to snack, but I've got to really revel in it. I'm going to &lt;em&gt;enjoy&lt;/em&gt; this food dammit". If you have a compulsive urge to check Twitter, aim to have fun on Twitter - go into a deep nerd dive on someone's timeline, do something interesting other than just scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If this works (I'm not sure the fork is viable, which is why I don't know if it will work yet), either you break the habit or you enjoy yourself more, and both of these are good things.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ideas Get You Unstuck</title>
    <updated>2020-06-27T12:28:23+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Ideas Get You Unstuck&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3d13X1P"&gt;the wave in the mind&lt;/a&gt; by Ursula K. Le Guin, page 279:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the book five times, it got nowhere. I had to stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to sit patiently and say nothing, at the same time every day, while the fox looked at me from the corner of its eye, and slowly let me get a little bit closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On the next page, 280:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics talk as if stories were all idea, but intellect does not make story and more than ideology makes art. The story had to make itself, find its center, find its voice, Sutty's voice. Then, because I was waiting for it, it could give itself to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Le Guin is talking about the process of story formation, and how it comes through an accretion of pieces that cause it to fit together. However I find it strange that she uses the fact that she had to sit and wait for Sutty's voice as evidence that a story is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; just composed about ideas, because Sutty's voice is, itself, an idea, and it came to her as most ideas inevitably do - at first slowly, and then suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;She's right of course that a story is not just composed of ideas. As with basically everything, a story is mostly composed of work, and skill in doing that work. Ideas serve the purpose they serve everywhere: They're there to get you unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Generally, if you're not currently stuck, you need to either do the work. If you're not good enough to do the work, you need to learn to be better at it (you can, of course, then get stuck in the learning process). That's where an idea helps you out: It &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html"&gt;gives you something to try&lt;/a&gt;. An idea is a thought that points to a way to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The two main ways of getting stuck are:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't know what to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know what to do but you don't know how to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think Le Guin is only using "idea" to refer to things that solve the first kind of getting stuck, but they're if anything more important for the second type. Ideas of the first kind are cheap: There are a million things to do at any moment, ideas about what to do are cheap, and if you're struggling to figure those out it's probably an emotional problem (e.g. "everything feels pointless and I hate myself" or "I'm not good enough to do any of these") rather than actual difficulty generating ideas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second version though is still idea generation, but it's idea generation on hard mode, because you can't just pick an idea and see where it leads the ideas you generate actually have to have a decent chance of working, for some very specific notion of work. These are the times that force you to actually develop the skill of idea generation,
and the first part of that skill is that process that Le Guin describes of &lt;a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/09/20/the-state-of-being-stuck/"&gt;getting stuck and sitting with it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I'm not actually that curious</title>
    <updated>2020-06-28T17:46:46+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;I'm not actually that curious&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-28&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Small personal note, but I've noticed a number of people have a particular misconception of me,
and thought I'd clear it up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You know how I read insatiably, driven by pure curiosity, and know a huge amount of different things just because I wanted to know them?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I don't do that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At least, I don't do that often. It's a thing I do &lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;, but an idle scan of my bookshelves suggests that no more than about one book in twenty is something I've read out of pure interest. Generally speaking if I'm reading something nonfiction it's because I expect it will actually improve my life in some material way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'd like this to not be the case: It would be wonderful if I could just read things because I thought they were interesting, but I actually find it very difficult to be interested in knowledge that I can't use in some way to solve practical problems. I suspect that will improve as the ongoing project to improve my emotional landscape progresses, but I'm very much not there yet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong, a lot of the books I read are super interesting in their own right, and I do appreciate that aspect of them. I also don't do well at reading boring books. But I don't &lt;em&gt;select&lt;/em&gt; books because they're interesting, I select books because they'll help me with something. The emotion that most commonly drives me to read a book isn't curiosity, it's distress: Something is bad, and my stress response is to understand more about the subject matter so I can make it better, so I read a book about it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; distress. Sometimes it's because I'm annoyed that something doesn't make sense. Sometimes it's a simple desire for improvement, or some really concrete problem to solve. Sometimes it's just a general background faith that even if I don't have a specific problem I'm trying to solve then the book will be good for &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This might seem odd given my reading material ("David, what are you reading?" "I'm reading a Christian theology book about how giving yourself over to Christ will solve capitalism." "Of course you are.") but what you have to bear in mind is that I am a deeply unreasonable person with a very idiosyncratic approach to knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you read my &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html"&gt;notes towards a manifesto&lt;/a&gt;, a lot of what I'm working on is "general humaning skills". What field do you need to read in in order to figure out how to do humaning better? Basically all of them I'm afraid.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I say &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html"&gt;All knowledge is connected&lt;/a&gt; I think most people nod sagely and agree that this is true in principle, and you do get people reading out their field a bit (e.g. Software developers reading architecture books is a thing, though mostly because books about software development are mostly terrible, and every field has a subculture of people telling you that you need to read &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1270346474027712513"&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/a&gt; to truly understand it). But I don't think, by and large, people fully embrace it as a praxis, mostly because it's really hard and time consuming.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have three advantages here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I take the idea seriously and am willing to put in the work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don't find it that hard. I'm good at reading books, I'm good at connecting up knowledge, and I generally prefer hitting practical problems with huge theory hammers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a relatively large amount of time to devote to the problem, especially &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/why-am-i-not-working-on-my-phd"&gt;on days when I'm failing to work on my PhD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The result is that yes I just really &lt;em&gt;am&lt;/em&gt; the sort of person who goes "Community drama seems like a really hard problem. Why don't I read &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-05-09-15:33.html"&gt;a text on Talmudic law&lt;/a&gt; so I can understand it better?" and have a project to learn phenomenology so I can improve my own subjective emotional experience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Does this work?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Honestly, yes. I cannot say that I recommend it to everyone, or even to most people, but I've found it extraordinarily helpful. It's not sufficient in its own right, but I've been taking this seriously for a few years and really kicked it into high gear this year with the addition of the writing practice to properly integrate this knowledge, and I've seen huge improvements in my life enabled by it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I expect I'll keep reading like this for at least another couple of years - with any luck I'll gradually include a higher fraction of pure interest reading as time goes on, but I doubt I'm at any risk of solving all my problems any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I can't read everything relevant to my problems of course. I'm not trying to. What I'm trying to do is cultivate a &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-13-11:35.html"&gt;domus&lt;/a&gt; that gives me a sufficient wealth of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-27-11:07.html"&gt;ideas to get me unstuck&lt;/a&gt; on making progress with the problems I have.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(A domus is a concept I got from reading about the early history of civilisation and the role of grain cultivation - James C. Scott is an author I tend to just read because I assume I'll get something useful out of it even if I don't know what going in. Haven't been wrong yet)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I encounter a limitation, I read new material to overcome it. Because the category of problems I am trying to solve is, in the limit, &lt;em&gt;all of human endeavour&lt;/em&gt;, there's no shortage of limitations. The result is a constant switching around of what I'm working on based on what I can currently make progress on, and reading whatever seems most currently accessible and relevant to the bits I'm actively stuck on. This tends to cause me to bounce around a lot between different fields, because once I've read a book (or a couple books sometimes) about a subject I need a while to let it bed in and try applying it and integrating it before I'm ready to read more in that area.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From the outside this process &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; looks a lot like curiosity, but as a David expert I'm here to tell you that this isn't cute, and Davids only behave this way when they're under stress.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Free and Open Source Social Technology</title>
    <updated>2020-06-30T18:39:22+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Free and Open Source Social Technology&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-06-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/36FzofT"&gt;Where Good Ideas Come From&lt;/a&gt; by Steven Johnson, page 242:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Lawrence Lessig has so persuasively argued over the years, there is nothing "natural" about the artificial scarcity of intellectual property law. [...] Ideas are intrinsically copyable in the way that food and fuel are not. You have to build dams to keep ideas from flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is in the context of Johnson talking about what he calls the &lt;em&gt;fourth quadrant&lt;/em&gt; - ideas generated by networks of people operating outside of market incentives. The fourth quadrant is in fact a great source of innovation, and a large part of that is this relative lack of intellectual property dams. If someone comes up with a great idea and isn't interested in making money off it, they're usually delighted if you copy them. Good etiquette requires that you &lt;em&gt;credit&lt;/em&gt; them, and ideally (in the spirit of open source) if you make any improvements to the idea you pay it back by telling them or others about it, so as long as everyone behaves like a vaguely good citizen sharing ideas that you don't intend to monetize is a net positive for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One difficulty is when ideas escape the network and into the market - if you share your idea and someone goes "that's a great idea, I'm going to make money off it", that's less good. Firstly, you feel exploited (in many cases this will be literally &lt;a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/09/the-question-of-cultural-appropriation"&gt;cultural exploitation&lt;/a&gt;) and secondly now there's an entity who likely has more money (and thus power) than you who is liable to claim ownership of the idea and/or make demands of you, and because you gave the idea away for free you have little leverage.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If I sound bitter, this is of course because we run into this problem in FOSS a lot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there's a nice example where this doesn't really come up that much, which is &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/the-missing-social-technology-sector/"&gt;social technology&lt;/a&gt;. You do get people "selling" social technology through writing books and doing consulting or training courses, but even there it tends to be pretty much part of the network rather than the market, with members of the network also making money off it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot more people are developing social technology, and more general technologies in the form of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html"&gt;the techniques of being human&lt;/a&gt;. In the last year or so I've been hanging out with the group who I tend to refer to as "feelings Twitter" - a very loosely aligned group of people who basically do a lot of weird therapy and talk about their feelings and the tools they've used to explore them. This is very much an example of fourth quadrant innovation, with people mixing and matching, generating new techniques, boosting ideas that have worked well for them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So far this all seems to work out pretty well, and I think a large part of that is that even though you can make money off this sort of thing very few of us are trying to do so (I suppose I kinda am trying to make money off it, in that the newsletter is paid, but I'm pretty far from being there). Being better humans is &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/what-do-you-do"&gt;our work but not our job&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the moment I don't see much risk of us falling into the FOSS trap of having to support companies who are using our stuff for free (providing free therapy in your DMs is a lot more likely, but I think quite a different problem and not necessarily a problem at all), and if a company uses our ideas that's generally going to be somewhere between neutral an positive for us (it might be a bit annoying if and when they butcher them).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And, to go back to the original quote, a lot of that is because you can't patent social technologies. Lets keep it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cultivating the Skills of Context</title>
    <updated>2020-07-01T11:12:32+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Cultivating the Skills of Context&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-07-01&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Have you noticed how there are jokes that really can only exist in their extremely specific context?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1268905827399761921"&gt;Here's an example&lt;/a&gt;. The joke is kinda obvious in context, but it entertained me, and there is really &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; other context in which that joke could possibly have existed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Something &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1276155095370084354"&gt;I lightly advocated for recently&lt;/a&gt; is the use of niche analogies. e.g. I get good mileage out of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html"&gt;analogies between programming and therapy&lt;/a&gt;. I also get good mileage out of analogies between farming and ethics. I also get good mileage out of &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-05-09:08.html"&gt;analogies between farming and ethics&lt;/a&gt; ("cultivating" is itself something of a farming analogy). These analogies will typically only work for a small group of people, because they have to be in the intersection of the groups who understand each of the things being compared, but they may work very well for those people.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/unusual-foundations"&gt;unusual foundations&lt;/a&gt; I argued that you have a unique set of skills and background, and as a result may be able to take advantage of them in unique ways that allow you to achieve things more easily than advice would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A lot of software is &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/11/situated-software/"&gt;situated&lt;/a&gt; - it is extremely embedded in a particular environment and use case, and has none of the things that you might expect from a more general purpose piece of software, to the point where it may be easier to write a new one than to adapt the software to a new context (this notebook blog is itself a piece of situated software).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What all of these have in common is that they are things that only work in a very specific context. They don't generalise (or "scale" if you prefer) outside of that context, because they take advantage of hyper-specific features that are not widely shared.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is that a bad thing?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I tell (or, more realistically, hear) a really funny joke that works only in that specific context, I always feel a little annoyed because I would like to share the joke and can't. But maybe the reason the joke is so funny is precisely &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of its uniqueness - its reliance on the situation is what gives it its novelty and makes it funny.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Advice that generalises is great, because it can help more people, but the nature of advice is that the more you generalise it the less good it becomes, because you have to simplify it so people understand, you have to add preconditions or remove the things that depend on those preconditions. Often by the time you've reached enough people you've put in a lot of work and made it less good as a result. This is the whole reason I wrote the unusual foundations post - for any given general purpose piece of advice there is probably a better context specific piece of advice. So you end up trading off between number of people you help and how much you help them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(This isn't entirely true because helping more people &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-30-17:03.html"&gt;gives you more people to innovate on the advice&lt;/a&gt;, but you can have your cake and eat it too by sharing the advice in its context-specific form, along with explaining the context, and let other people innovate to adapt it to themselves)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This pattern repeats over and over again, with generalising things being a lot of work and typically making them worse.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But of course one nice thing about generalising is that you often don't have to do that work in the first place. Someone &lt;a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/thinking-through-the-implications/"&gt;has already invented the hammer&lt;/a&gt;, I don't need to come up with a custom context-specific artisanal solution to hammer in this particular nail.
As a result, in the moment a general purpose solution is often easier than a context-specific one &lt;em&gt;as long as that general purpose solution already exists&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, I think, the source of a lot of mediocrity: It's too much work to do the good thing, so we fall back to the known thing. We only use a context-specific solution when there isn't an easy general purpose one, or when the context-specific one is obvious to us (e.g. the jokes).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;(The general-purpose solution is, of course, not &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; worse than a context-specific one - often a general-purpose solution has been refined through a great deal of time and effort, and trying to adopt a context-specific one is like rolling your own crypto: It's bad)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But everything we do has a rich set of context. This means that we should expect there to be a rich set of context-specific solutions available to us, and we're often likely ignoring them and trying to fit an inappropriate general purpose solution to the situation in question.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The solution is, I think, to generalise from the solutions we find in context, but not by generalising the solution and instead generalising the process by which we found it. By cultivating the skills of looking at a context and identifying whether it permits things that are not possible in the broader world, we lower the effort of finding context-specific solutions, which will often allow us to move from mediocrity to excellence.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>From Maintaining to Making</title>
    <updated>2020-07-02T10:06:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;From Maintaining to Making&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2020-07-02&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3bW2J6t"&gt;The Shock of the Old&lt;/a&gt; by David Edgerton, page 98:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many examples in the history of twentieth-century technology where enterprises started by maintaining a technology, moved on to manufacture components or the whole thing, and then to innovate. But equally there are others where maintenance did not lead to such a development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This point is, of course, straight out of &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2WYUxyi"&gt;The Economy of Cities&lt;/a&gt; by Jane Jacobs (and Edgerton explicitly mentions it).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think one of the interesting dynamics of maintenance is that maintenance is intrinsically &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-01-09:38.html"&gt;context-specific&lt;/a&gt;. You're not maintaining cars, you're maintaining this specific car. Over time, two identical objects have their own events and history - sometimes they're deliberately modified, sometimes they're just used in a particular way which causes particular strains. This intimately affects what you need to do to maintain them.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The skill of generalising from that maintenance is differently hard - it involves thinking about how things behave when stripped of their context, and robs you of a lot of context-specific tools. For example, it is not in the nature of the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-26-09:48.html"&gt;kludge&lt;/a&gt; to generalise.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But, equally, maintenance both gives you a strong incentive to generalise, because although each object you maintain is different, you get to see many objects and start to notice the patterns through them over and over again. A maintainer is significantly more aware of what the lifecycle of the objects in use is than the manufacturer, and this probably leads very naturally into superior manufacturing if you've got the means and inclination to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
