&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Creativity on demand&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-03-26&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things in my bags of tricks is using random prompts for
things. What should I write about today? IDK, draw a tarot card, flip to
a random page of a book. Write something in response to it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another thing in my bag of tricks is making big lists. Can’t think of
anything? Think of 100 things instead! Can’t think how to start the
list? Come up with a bad idea. Or, even worse, a mediocre one.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another thing in my bag of tricks is to look at something mundane and
figure out what’s interesting about it. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-23-21:48.html"&gt;Cleaning
the kitchen&lt;/a&gt; is an example of that. &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/using-what-youre-given"&gt;So is
making apples&lt;/a&gt;. To some degree the entire &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/my-no-longer-secret-magical-practice"&gt;spellcraft
thing&lt;/a&gt; is about this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The point that I’m trying to get at is that with all these tools in
my toolkit, it’s pretty easy for me to solve any drying up of the
creative wellspring. Not only &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-09:44.html"&gt;can’t
you run out of ideas&lt;/a&gt;, there are reliable procedures for producing
more ideas.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example, here off the top of my head is a spell for writing a
blog post at the end of the day:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Get a sheet of paper. Write down what you did today - not in detail,
just a list of high level things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Pick one. If one of them catches your eye, use that, otherwise pick
semi-randomly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Try to pick out some specific features of it - things that remind you
of other things, or some way it’s unlike other things in that category.
Especially focus on how you made any decisions about it, or how it
felt.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Write about that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway you’ll notice I’m not using this spell right now. I can’t rule
out that I might in future - I did do the first part of listing out
stuff that happened in my day, and for example I thought I might write
something about some work I’m doing on parsing with derivatives, which I
thought was interesting because of a series of pickles I got myself in
and out of, or I thought I might write about the lunch I made for
myself, in which I took some leftovers from our sunday roast and some
vegetables and turned it into a vaguely Chinese meal.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Fun fact: Left over roast potatoes are great when stir
fried with a bit of ginger.&lt;/span&gt;
There’s also something to be said about the experience of waking up, or
&lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/losing-yourself-in-an-audiobook"&gt;my
changing relationship with audiobooks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I didn’t though, partially because I’d already started on this,
partially because I didn’t really feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m reading a recent translation of Max Weber’s “Science ad a
Vocation” right now, and the following passage struck me:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both [a laboratory and a factory] it is necessary for somethign,
and the right thing at that, to &lt;em&gt;occur&lt;/em&gt; to people if they are to
achieve anything worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But inspiration cannot be produced to order. And it has nothing in
common with cold calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve also recently been reading “The Cult of Information” by Theodore
Roszak, which is surprisingly good, and it has a similar thing in it
about how a computer-focused education with its heavy emphasis on
procedural thinking cannot possibly teach children the full range of
creative and intuitive thought that we need them to develop.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point is that on some level I think they’re wrong.
Intuitively I believe that I really could write a couple of pages of
instructions that you could semi-mechanically follow and produce a
pretty good essay out of. I’m not claiming you could produce
&lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; good essay this way you understand, only that it’s
possible to produce a pretty good generator of essays this way, one that
means that you should never have to suffer the problem of sitting down
in front of the computer and not know what to write.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And yet, every time I think about actually doing this, my soul
rebels.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Things like the random book prompt or tarot prompt or the like seem
mostly fine. The above spell for coming up with something interesting
about your day to report on also seems mostly fine - maybe a little over
constraining, and requires me to look at uncomfortable questions like
“What &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; I do today?” sometimes, but it’s actually an
interesting exercise.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But if you tell me to, say, roll a die and use it to determine on the
basis of that what to write today, I will fight you.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If, on the other hand, you tell me that if I’m not sure which one to
write then I &lt;em&gt;get to&lt;/em&gt; roll a dice to pick one, that’s just &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-make-easy-decisions"&gt;a
spell for making decisions&lt;/a&gt;. Great stuff, no complaints. Big fan,
even.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The thing about procedures is that they’re great tools and terrible
masters. The kitchen cleaning procedure is very good because I need to
do the thing and I don’t want to have to make decisions about how to do
the thing. A writing procedure that removes all decisions would be
terrible, because the decisions &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the creative process. I can
be aided in making them, but anything that tries to take the ultimate
authority away from me causes me to bristle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And this is sortof a problem for the goal of creativity on demand,
because the problem isn’t actually that I can’t produce creativity on
demand - I can - it’s that I &lt;em&gt;don’t want to&lt;/em&gt;. The whole
experience is one of dragging myself kicking and screaming towards some
goal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The idea of a fully mechanized process for writing, even one with
explicitly allowances for breaking out of it and doing your own thing,
is still fundamentally designed to take away the first and most
important decision about creating something: Whether you want to do it
at all. Once that decision is taken away from it, the creative part of
my mind mostly just wants to sit there and sulk and refuse to
participate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And you know what? Too bad. Gonna write anyway. When the dishes gotta
be done, you do the dishes whether you like it or not. When the daily
writing gotta be done, you do the daily writing whether you like it or
not. It’s probably not going to be as bad as you think, and if it is &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/believing-that-you-can-stop"&gt;you
can stop&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s no reason not to start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Censored solutions</title>
    <updated>2025-03-27T11:42:20+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Censored solutions&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-03-27&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve got two&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Actually far more than two, but two that are relevant
things here.&lt;/span&gt; big things I care about:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Solving problems people have&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying things that “everybody knows” but nobody says&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Which is why it’s particularly interesting to me that there are
certain classes of solution that are broadly known but almost never
mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I first started noticing this because of insomnia advice. I don’t
have &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; insomnia, but I do suffer from it a bit, and many
people I know have it about as bad or worse.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia/"&gt;the NHS’s
advice for what to do about it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;go to bed and wake up at the same time every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;relax at least 1 hour before bed, for example, take a bath or read a
book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet – use curtains, blinds, an
eye mask or ear plugs if needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exercise regularly during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make sure your mattress, pillows and covers are comfortable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not smoke or drink alcohol, tea or coffee at least 6 hours before
going to bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not eat a big meal late at night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not exercise at least 4 hours before bed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not watch television or use devices, like smartphones, right
before going to bed, because the blue light makes you more awake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not nap during the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not drive when you feel sleepy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;do not sleep in after a bad night’s sleep and stick to your regular
sleeping hours instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;They then go on to mention that you can get sleep aids, either mild
ones from a pharmacist or stronger ones from a GP.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I don’t perfectly agree with all of this, but it’s all perfectly
standard sensible advice, of the sort you’ll get from any reasonable
person when you ask for insomnia advice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s so standard and reasonable that I don’t know if you even noticed
that it omits one of the more widely deployed insomnia solutions.
There’s a reliable, widely known, and commonly used, solution which
helps take your mind off the racing thoughts that cause insomnia and
relax your body, and is very effective and helps you fall asleep:
Masturbating.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Or having sex, but in some ways masturbating is more
effective as a sleep aid than partnered sex. You are, after all, as Kant
would put it, &lt;a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/15804744?view_adult=true"&gt;using
yourself as an means, not an end&lt;/a&gt;. Also when you’re lying awake
frustrated by insomnia, hopefully your partner is already asleep and
you’re unlikely to be feeling particularly sexy anyway.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I am reasonably sure, through various discussions, memes, and general
logical inferences, that this is not news to most people. I’m pretty
sure you’ve heard of masturbating, and most people seem to figure out
that it helps them sleep.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But it can still be useful to give advice that most people already
know. It’s remarkably common for people to either not know or forget
common every day knowledge, and also insomnia is often when you’re
feeling least reasonable, so it’s useful to have a reminder. I bet at
least one person with insomnia will read this and go “Oh! I hadn’t
thought of that!”.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And as a result there will be some random person out
there masturbating because I told them to, and that’s &lt;em&gt;weird&lt;/em&gt;,
which is one of the reasons why people don’t casually give advice like
this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s also not just insomnia. Another of my big things is that if
you’ve got a tool that works in one problem, maybe try it in others?
Someone was asking the other day about tension headaches, and writing
this I belatedly realised that actually if you’ve got a problem caused
by the level of physical stress you’re carrying, maybe doing something
that relaxes your body would be a good idea… I’ve definitely solved
things in the headache / general malaise category this way from time to
time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Still, masturbating is a relatively special purpose tool. You’re both
limited in how often you can use it, and while it’s very useful for a
small category of problems, it certainly can’t solve everything. For
some things you need drugs!&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;To the best of my knowledge, nobody is censoring
themselves from recommending rock and roll as a solution to their
problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I wrote a while ago about how &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/people-dont-work-as-much-as-you-think"&gt;people
don’t work as much as you think&lt;/a&gt; and one of the common responses is
“OK, but some people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;. How can I be more like them?”. The
easy answer is amphetamines. Or maybe modafinil if you can’t get a
prescription and would rather something with less legal consequences for
getting caught.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not that stimulants are &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; for working longer. I’ve
actually found my working hours have gone up a bit since quitting
caffeine. Also, many people are just naturally like that because of some
mix of obsession and good health. But, among the people who might need
advice on this subject, the most effective (and widely deployed)
solution to this is that you take strong stimulants and that lets you
work more.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;People are a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more willing to give this category of
advice, because it doesn’t feel so weird, but there are certainly broad
categories of places where it would be inappropriate or unacceptable.
Your boss might give you all sorts of helpful feedback on how to improve
your productivity, but they will (or should) never say “BTW, I know a
guy who can get you some black market ritalin.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I struggle to come up with too many more examples that aren’t
straight up unethical.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;YMMV about whether the drugs one is or not.&lt;/span&gt; Perhaps another example is piracy,
but I think we’re at the stage where the degree to which you don’t tell
people to pirate things is that your university lectures stand up and
very sternly tell you about how piracy is bad and here is a list of the
sites you definitely shouldn’t go to because they might tempt you into
piracy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Maybe one other category is that people prefer to offer advice that
makes them look better than they are. e.g. if you ask how to do
somethign, you’ll often be told how to do it Properly - don’t skip any
steps, make sure you check for problems, etc. - when in reality the
advice giver will often do things far more sloppily. &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/decisions-depend-on-the-decision"&gt;This
isn’t necessarily bad&lt;/a&gt;, but you also can’t necessarily trust their
judgement as to whether it is or not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that I’m struggling to come up with other examples
because there are other examples that I don’t know about because nobody
talks about them and I’m the one being clueless! That’s the problem with
&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-16-14:22.html"&gt;ghost
knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re not inside the network, you don’t know what’s
going on!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, there are good reasons why people don’t offer this sort of
advice too often. I can’t be bothered to enumerate them, but they do
exist. I’m not making this post to chastise for people for not saying
“Have you tried masturbating about the problem?”, merely to point out
the more general phenomenon:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All advice you get is censored to be the sort of advice that the
advice-giver is comfortable giving, and there are often good solutions
outside of that space. If you’re stuck, and none of the suggestions
people are making are working, it’s worth considering whether there are
things that they wouldn’t suggest but would do, and seeing if any of
those work for you instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Behaving as if you were trying to succeed</title>
    <updated>2025-03-28T13:46:09+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Behaving as if you were trying to succeed&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-03-28&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In a flat I shared a while back, for some reason we owned a wooden
meat tenderising mallet.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Disgusting object. Can’t recommend.&lt;/span&gt; One of my flatmates was the main
person who used it, so I assume it was hers, but it lived with all of
the other kitchen utensils.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One day I discovered it had been put away still covered in bits of
raw chicken. I politely expressed some disapproval of this fact.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;She seemed vaguely baffled by this objection. I don’t remember her
exact words, but it was something to the tune of “I did wash it! But
it’s hard to clean”.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;As a side note, I should observe that this was a long
time ago. I no longer live with her but we’re still in touch and I
believe she has become a vastly cleaner person in more recent years. I
also very much enjoyed living with her at the time despite these
foibles. This is not a story about how terrible she was as a flatmate.&lt;/span&gt; I, in turn, expressed the sentiment
that if something is hard to clean then that means you &lt;em&gt;clean it more
thoroughly&lt;/em&gt;, or don’t use it, but that putting things away with raw
meat stuck to them was not among the acceptable set of outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;She did rewash it, but I’m not sure my point really stuck.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Unlike the chicken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve thought about this example over and over again since then, in
various shared living situations, because I’ve run into a surprising
number of people who are bad at washing up in a particular way: It’s not
that they’re incompetent at the basic mechanical actions of washing up&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Although to some degree they probably are this too,
because they lack a basic feedback mechanism required to get good at
it.&lt;/span&gt;, but that they &lt;em&gt;don’t check if
the thing they’ve washed up is clean afterwards&lt;/em&gt;, and as a result a
substantial fraction of things they wash up still have food stuck to
them. It’s usually not as bad as the raw chicken incident, but it’s bad
enough that I don’t consider the things they washed up to be clean
enough to put away without double checking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As a result, I typically ended up rewashing stuff they’ve washed,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Depending on how bitchy I’m feeling sometimes I’d get
them to do it instead, but that’s often more stressful than doing it
myself. This is not a good strategy and I don’t endorse it, but it is
the one I tend to follow.&lt;/span&gt; which means they’ve put in a bunch
of work for literally zero effect, and made me more annoyed at them than
I would be if they hadn’t done anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Similarly, back when I used to work in more end-user-facing software
with an actual web interface and such,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is less necessary with library code because the
code is the user interface and you can see it being used in the tests.&lt;/span&gt;, I
used to deploy this really exciting magical code review technique that
reliably found problems with people’s pull requests: I checked out the
branch, launched the web application, and tried actually using the
feature. Often it had obvious problems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This has become something of a bugbear of mine in general: People
doing things as if the thing itself was the point, rather than a tool
you are using to achieve a specific outcome, and not thinking about
whether their actions will actually in any way help them achieve their
goal. The result of this is often that they put in about 90% of the
effort required to do it properly, and get 0% of the actual benefit
because what they did didn’t actually work.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The easiest way to fix this is to &lt;em&gt;check whether what you did
worked&lt;/em&gt; after doing it. Initially, this will slow you down a bit and
add delays, but as you get good at it you will basically internalise the
process and it doesn’t slow you down much.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Except in the sense that sometimes you’ll find problems
and have to fix them.&lt;/span&gt; I
do, however, suspect that in many of these cases the actual thing you
need to do to fix this is to become someone who actually cares about the
end result rather than just wanting to avoid being blamed for not doing
the thing and hoping nobody will notice.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Bad news! I will notice. Yes, including that time you
thought you got away with it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is also important because there are many examples where you
can’t really check if it worked. For example, I still semi-often see
people wearing face masks in public. I rarely do these days, but
consider this a completely reasonable choice. Unless, that is, you’re
wearing your facemask pulled down so it doesn’t cover your nose. In
which case &lt;em&gt;what on earth are you doing?&lt;/em&gt; How have you made it to
2025 without looking up basic mask usage? But you’re never going to
figure out that you did this wrong by checking. What are you going to
check? Did I get a virus Y/N? That’s an incredibly noisy signal, and
tracing it back to the specific error you made is going to be almost
impossible. The only way to get this right is to actually care about
getting things right and then take whatever action is appropriate for
achieving this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, to be clear, I’m not claiming I always succeed. Sometimes I’m
rushing and forget to check something. Sometimes I check something
insufficiently carefully. Sometimes I check something and misinterpret
it, or otherwise make a stupid error. I’m not saying I’m perfect, I’m
not asking you or anyone else to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I am asking you to care about succeeding, and when you are
failing, &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-25-20:16.html"&gt;try to

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Well you gotta&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-03-29&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/for-the-better-right"&gt;The
Anakin/Padme meme&lt;/a&gt; seems to have occupied a useful conceptual shape
in my brain. You’ve probably seen it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The original goes:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anakin: “I’m going to change the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Padmé: “For the better, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anakin: (gazes in silence)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Padmé: “For the better, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, this particular shape appeals to me, so I see
the pattern over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been thinking about it in the context of one of my corner
of the internet’s recurring catch phrases. “You can just do things”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anakin: “You can just do things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Padmé: “That you want to, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anakin: (gazes in silence)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Padmé: “That you want to, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I think about this particular pattern a lot is parenting.
It’s common interaction with the child that I tell her she needs to do a
thing,&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Such as have a shower, clean her room, do her homework
assignments, all of the incredibly boring mundane cliched tyrannies of
parenting.&lt;/span&gt; and she replies “but I don’t
wanna”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have yet to adequately convey the magnitude of my lack of interest
in whether she wants to or not through anything other than the deeply
nuanced philosophical position: “Well you gotta”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t particularly work for persuading her you understand, but
neither does anything else, and it’s a more accurate, more honest, and,
I think, healthier position than trying to convince her to do it because
she should do it because she wants the end result, because often she
doesn’t care (or claims not to care) about the end result either and I
don’t consider her opinion on whether she’s allowed to be stinky or have
cavities or whatever to be relevant. I would, of course, much rather she
care about those things too, but one of the goals of parenting is that
it’s your job to make sure good decisions are being made.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of things of course where the fact that she doesn’t
want to do them is, in fact, and important and overriding consideration.
I’m not going to force her to play a board game she doesn’t want to play
for example.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Though I will at least discourage her from quitting one
midway through.&lt;/span&gt; The point is very much not that she
should do whatever I (or her other parents) want. It’s the much more
specific and important point that some things need to be done, and it
doesn’t matter if you want to do them, they still need to get done and
you need to be able to do them regardless of whether you wanna.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another meme in my circles is non-coercion, which is the idea that
you shouldn’t force yourself to do things. This also extends into
non-coercive parenting, which is that you shouldn’t force your kids to
do things. I suppose I don’t exactly disagree, but I think the details
are important to get right, and when “doing something because you’re
forced to” is treated as the opposite of “doing something because you
want to”, something has gone very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you want the ends and not the means. Sometimes you don’t
even want the ends but have an obligation to do them.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;You could argue that you want to fulfill your
obligations, but I would argue in turn that fulfilling an obligation
&lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; very different from a positive motivation to do the thing
most of the time.&lt;/span&gt; In
these circumstances, forcing yourself to have to pretend to want the
means in order to achieve the ends is &lt;em&gt;very bad for you&lt;/em&gt;, because
it forces you to basically lie to yourself about what you want. Being
able to calmly, and without any particular joy in your heart, do the
thing because it needs to be done is a much more valuable attitude to be
able to take.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of this comes down to parenting for me as well, and this is
definitely an attitude I’ve inherited from my parents. My parents are
both functioning workaholics. My dad, in particular, is in his 70s and
seems absolutely tireless to me.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Except, in fact, he’s not. He’s tired a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;. He’s got far
worse sleeping problems than me - they run in the family, and he got
them from his mother. So he often wakes up exhausted. And then he goes
out and does a phenomenal amount of hard physical labour.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;He once passed on a conversation he’d had with his mother about
tiredness. Her advice went something like this: “Yes of course you’re
tired. The trick is to not worry about it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I expect in the original version she sounded less like
Lawrence of Arabia.&lt;/span&gt; You
just have to get on with things anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At the time I hated this advice, but I’ve grown to see the wisdom of
it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When talking about &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-23-21:48.html"&gt;cleaning
the kitchen&lt;/a&gt; I made the point that you can choose to resent the fact
that it takes an hour or accept it, and that you’ll have to do the same
amount of work either way but it will be much more pleasant for you if
you don’t spend it resenting the effort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The same is true with needing to do things. You can resent them, or
you can just do them because they need to get done, and the latter will
be in every way more pleasant for you, and even if you’re not happy
about doing the thing you will be a happier person for being able
to.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is, of course, possible to take this too far, and end up burdened
by obligations that you don’t want because you’re the most reliable
person in the room because nobody else takes on this attitude. I’ve
ended up in that situation in past workplaces for example.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The most reliable and viable solution to this is to couple the
ability to do things that are needful with the ability to ask “OK, but
is this actually my problem?”, and a degree of conflict tolerance that
allows you to make it other people’s problem when it should be.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But, personally, the solution I would most prefer but have never
quite been able to manage is for other people to also adopt this
attitude and stop being goddamn freeloaders.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Necessity creates possibility</title>
    <updated>2025-03-30T15:42:55+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Necessity creates possibility&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-03-30&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the big reasons I’m doing daily writing right now is that I
quit caffeine. I have a very entrenched belief that quitting caffeine
makes it harder for me to think, and my evidence for this is that my
writing habit evaporates every time I quit caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is, as a factual matter, true that I stop writing when I quit
caffeine. That is a thing that happens. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-22-21:54.html"&gt;Writing
feels impossible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But there is, it turns out, a great technique for doing impossible
things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to do the thing and fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-25-20:16.html"&gt;Figure
out the actual specific thing that went wrong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fix that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here is my proposed default thing that goes wrong when you try to do
something that feels impossible: You think about doing the thing, you
are overcome with despair, you declare that it’s just impossible right
now, and then you flinch away from it and go do some dissociative
activity to self soothe from the aftermath of your terrible encounter
with the impossible.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Ask me how I know…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of why I’m big on &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html"&gt;necessity&lt;/a&gt;
is that it is a fix for this problem. If not doing something you find
aversive is an option, not doing thing is likely to be the option you
pick. If you’re definitely going to do the thing, you’re able to have a
genuine encounter with it without much fuss.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is, as a purely factual matter, not the case that it’s impossible
for me to write while not on caffeine. I write on WhatsApp or discord or
Twitter&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Well, not that one any more.&lt;/span&gt; all the time when off caffeine. The
actual mechanical act of writing is not that hard for me, and I often
say perfectly interesting things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I could absolutely just open up the notebook, paste a comment from
discord, and write here every day without thinking. I could flip to a
random page of a book and copy out some text on here. I could write “I
am a fish” 500 times.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I am tempted to just do this one day to stop this from
being a hypothetical that I use and make it a real live possibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This means that the only thing that is preventing me from writing
here every day is that I am &lt;em&gt;choosing not to&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, step one: Choose to. Put daily writing in the category of
necessity. This forces me to admit that it’s not actually impossible -
it’s not actually even terribly difficult - it is just mildly
uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This, in turn, creates encounters with the real problems that you’re
avoiding. Turns out, for me, I was struggling to find things that were
interesting for me to write about. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-26-19:06.html"&gt;It’s
not that I don’t know how to generate things to write about&lt;/a&gt;, but
those don’t feel interesting either.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of what’s happening here is that there are two major
relevant differences between my brain on caffeine and my brain off
caffeine:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With caffeine, my threshold for something seeming interesting is
much lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With caffeine, my thoughts are buzzing all around and generating
many different overlapping ideas all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So when I’m caffeinated, sitting down to write is basically just a
matter of waiting for an idea to come along, grabbing it out of the air,
and pulling on it until the thread of an essay comes out. On the rare
occasions I’m stuck, I use a random prompt to lightly prime the process,
but really even with the random prompts it works in part because my
brain is extremely prone to going “AND THAT REMINDS ME OF FIVE OTHER
THINGS”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When I’ve actually got something to write about, it’s not actually
that bad to write. It requires dealing with a degree of discomfort and
anxiety about the process, but it’s just a little bit slower and more
halting, it’s not actually a big deal it’s just mildly unpleasant.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is more true for notebook posts than for full
fledged essays that I actually have to think about because of how much
I’m just basically writing down my chain of thought reasoning here
rather than trying to make a clear well-articulated point.&lt;/span&gt;. But sitting down and going “argh
fuck argh what do I write about?” is torture, partly because it’s
intrinsically unpleasant and partly because it triggers a whole “oh god
my brain is broken how can I live without caffeine? Woe is me, for I am
an abject wretch, deprived of that which gives my life meaning!”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway that sounds like a problem, David, have you tried solving
it?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yes I have, and it turns out it’s extremely easily solved, and the
magic was inside me all along because I’ve solved this problem before.
&lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/using-a-list-to-manage-executive"&gt;The
solution is to make a list of things I could write about&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve now
just got a little pad of paper on my desk with the heading “Things I
could write about”. When something comes to mind during the day that
seems interesting to write about, I jot down some slightly cryptic
phrase or sentence describing it, and when I come to write something I
look at what’s on the page. &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-27-10:24.html"&gt;Censored
solutions&lt;/a&gt; was the first post I wrote using this system (partly
because writing &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-26-19:06.html"&gt;Creativity
on demand&lt;/a&gt; is what helped me spot it), and it’s been great since.
There are currenly 20 items on the list (including ones already
written).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The key thing that makes this work is that although it turns out that
I can’t currently generate ideas of what to write about at a rate that
means they just freely appear when I sit down to write, I sure generate
a lot of ideas in a day, the problem is that they don’t reliably stick
in my memory. As long as over the course of a day I generate more than
one idea to write about&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;It looks like right now I generate about five. It’s
likely that that will go down over time, but not necessarily - writing
begets more writing, because it gives you new things to think about.&lt;/span&gt;, the list will always be full.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn6"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn6" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I haven’t yet decided what to do when the list fills up.
I need to figure that out after finishing writing this post.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the point I’m making is not this specific technique is great
(although it is), it’s that this specific technique was in fact &lt;em&gt;very
easy to create&lt;/em&gt;, and I’ve tried and failed to write through caffeine
withdrawal multiple times before without creating it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn7"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn7" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I have actually tried a daily writing habit while off
caffeine before and it didn’t stick, but the way it failed was that I
was having a terrible time for other reasons and went back on coffee
before I ran out of backlog of ideas of what to write about.&lt;/span&gt;
Taking the option of not writing off the table and just making it my
problem to figure out how to do it any way forced me to figure out what
the real, specific, problem was, and do something about it rather than
just treating it as impossible.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Necessity creates possibility: If you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do something,
probably you’ll figure out how.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn8"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn8" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Or, you know, fail horribly and die. But it’s hard to
fuck up a writing habit so hard you die.&lt;/span&gt; If it’s optional, it’s
too easy to make excuses as to why you couldn’t possibly do it.
Frequently those excuses will feel very real and plausible, but
evaporate as soon as confronted with a firm insistence that you try.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Win Streaking and Reliability</title>
    <updated>2025-03-31T19:10:48+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Win Streaking and Reliability&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-03-31&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to learn to win streak in Slay the Spire recently.
That is, get several wins back to back. I’m only playing on Ascension 1
for this, although I am trying to kill the heart (if you don’t know what
this means: Challenging but not the hardest mode).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty good at Slay the Spire. I’m not the best, not even close,
but I can semi-regularly beat it on the hardest mode, which is a
reasonably difficult achievement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But I think one of the things this experiment is very much
demosntrating to me is that I’m playing it wrong. I’m very much engaged
in what you might call “vibe play”&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Get your mind out of the gutter.&lt;/span&gt;, where I’ve got a pretty
well honed intuition as to how to play it, and mostly follow that with a
little bit of tactical reasoning layered on top.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t produce many win streaks. I think on good days I win
maybe… 5-10% of my ascension 20 games, and probably somewhere in 40%
region for ascension 1. This is good for generating lots of wins, but
very bad for win streaking. At 40%, you’ll get some two-streaks,
occasionally three-streaks, and very rarely four-streaks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is, I think, an intrinsic limitation on vibe play, and if I want
to actually win streak I need to start doing some sort of deliberate
play. The problem in slay the spire is that it’s very easy to learn ways
of playing that work very well if the game hands you gimmes. e.g. I
think everyone can beat the heart on A20 most of the time when they get
dead branch/corruption, but you don’t get that very often. If that
happens in, say, 1% of games, you can pretty easily vibe-play your way
to an appreciable win rate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A more general example, one that I think I’m prone to, is that it’s
very easy to take too many risks in Act 1, which will let you either get
very strong early on or die early on. This pretty rapidly gets you up to
a decent win rate where you win a substantial fraction of the time that
you don’t die in Act 1.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;This is definitely a little bit my problem, although I’m
more likely to die in Act 2 than Act 1 because Act 2 is the hard act.&lt;/span&gt;, but you have a high loss rate in
Act 1, and trying to fix that ends up actually lowering your win rate
because you’re not strong.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things I’m trying to point to in &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html"&gt;Necessity
Creates Possibility&lt;/a&gt; is that it’s very easy to end up in this
situation in real life too. It’s very easy to write when you’re in the
mood to write. That gets your win % on writing up to an appreciable
amount above zero. But if you don’t learn to write when you don’t feel
like writing, you end up very limited in how far you can improve.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The problem with moving off vibe play is that part of how you learn
vibe play is that it’s fun.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Stop snickering.&lt;/span&gt; Learning to step outside
that requires taking a more deliberate perspective on the game. I’ve
talked before about &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/record-yourself"&gt;recording
yourself playing&lt;/a&gt; to do this, but at this point I’m probably better
off actually breaking out pencil and paper and sketching out things
like:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ol type="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s my goal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do I need to have achieved by floor X?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What probability do I assign to clearing this act?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And having a very slow methodical approach to the problem, where I
actually think about what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sounds boring TBH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is often a problem you get: You can succeed on pure
talent and enjoyment as long as things are going your way, but in order
to get really good you have to become reliable, and in order to do that
you have to figure out how to succeed even when the world isn’t
cooperating with you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;You create rules, rules create you&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-01&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I used to be a huge &lt;a href="https://www.beeminder.com/"&gt;Beeminder&lt;/a&gt; fan.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;In some ways I still am a huge Beeminder fan (certainly
I’m a big fan of the Beeminder team), I just happen to be a
non-practicing one.&lt;/span&gt; For
those who don’t know, Beeminder is a commitment system. You say “I’m
going to do this thing X times a week”, or “I’ll spend at most X hours a
week doing this”, or any other commitment about your life that you can
phrase as a metric.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the features of it I thought was extremely well thought out
was the way changing this commitment worked, which is that you can
change it at any time… and that change will take a week to take effect.
You’re always allowed to let future you off the hook, but the fact that
you don’t want to adhere to your commitment right this very minute
doesn’t get you off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can, of course, fail to uphold your commitment (“derail”), at
which point you pay Beeminder a previously agreed penalty.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;You can also email them with an excuse as to why you
should be let off the hook and an actual human will read it. Sometimes
they’ll just let you off the hook, sometimes they’ll say “Are you sure
that’s a good enough reason?” and maybe you’ll shuffle your feet and say
“No I guess not” and pay them or maybe you’ll stick to your guns.&lt;/span&gt; It
essentially makes the entire thing a sort of asynchronous negotiation
between your past and future selves. You can decide what commitments you
want to hold your future self to, and you can choose whether to break
your current commitments to your past self, but you cannot
&lt;em&gt;forgive&lt;/em&gt; those commitments. You are forced to either uphold them
or pay the costs of not doing so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is often a good model for trying to choose who to be,
even when it’s not as cleanly mediated by beeminder. When I talk about
&lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html"&gt;necessity&lt;/a&gt;
it’s really this sort of commitment made by your past self that I’m
talking about. I don’t pay a financial penalty for failing to write
daily, but I do pay the emotional cost by knowing that I’ve let down
this thing that past me has committed to. At some point I will indeed
decide to stop the daily writing&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Typically I keep it up for 1-3 months before it starts
to lose the appeal, and that’s fine. But also… maybe I won’t. Maybe I’ll
just keep up the daily writing forever, possibly with some
modifications. Who knows?&lt;/span&gt;, but when that happens
it won’t be because one day I’ve just decided I have enough, it will be
because I choose to release future me from his commitments to
writing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Probably at some point in that time I will fail to write some day.
That was nearly today, honestly. It’s not been a great day. This isn’t
the end of the world. Maybe there will be a good reason for it and I
won’t feel bad, maybe there won’t be a good reason and I’ll resolve to
do better, but the important thing is that I will acknowledge that the
rule was broken, and this was an important fact that I should respond
appropriately to, and that I should consider this fact when deciding
whether to break the rule or not - ask myself if I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; need
to or if I could in fact do the thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think being able to choose rules that you follow and then stick to
them is very important, and you can use them to shape your emotional
reactions to things, and make aspiring towards be the sort of person you
want to be easier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One problem with the Beeminder analogy&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And part of why I don’t use Beeminder any more.&lt;/span&gt; is
that it makes it sound like the rules you follow are mostly about
creating negative emotions - they create ways of punishing yourself for
not upholding the ideal. I don’t think this has to be the case. For
example, with the daily writing there’s certainly a sort of “Ugh, I
guess &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-29-10:40.html"&gt;I’ve
gotta&lt;/a&gt;” feeling because I know I’ll feel bad if I don’t do it, but
then I follow the rule it feels &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. There’s something very
satisfying about writing every day, above and beyond the general
satisfaction of writing. It helps elaborate a stream of thinking that
ties thought into life in a way that I very much appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can also have rules that are more lightweight or even purely
positive. For example, one rule I live by is that I always say hello to
ducks if I see ducks. Why? Dunno. I started doing it, and I enjoyed it,
so I kept doing it. It’s not a rule I would feel guilty for not
following, but it is a rule I actively try to follow and it pleases me
to do so.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think you can also do this by creating your own &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/fragments-intellectual-diy"&gt;idiosyncratic
categories and distinctions&lt;/a&gt; about the world. For example, I have a
mental category of “proper meal” which is basically defined by it having
to have three different vegetables in it.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn5"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn5" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;There is a series of complicated rules and codicils to
this rule. For example: Neither mango, obviously, nor onions are
vegetables, but a dish which combines mangos and onions counts as one
vegetable. I’m aware this is a stupid piece of convoluted Byzantine
logic, but also it’s obviously correct so shut up.&lt;/span&gt; I
try to have at least one proper meal in this sense per day. I don’t
firmly commit to doing this, but a day in which I have at least one
proper meal feels better than a day in which I don’t, because I’ve
decided that this is the sort of meal I should cook.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things I learned with Beeminder is that you can’t add too
many rules at once. It quickly gets overwhelming and you quit the whole
thing in distress as your willingness to engage with the experience
collapses under the burden of it. But for many of the rules we live by,
the actual rule has long dissolved into being just… you. I occasionally
reach for the proper meal rule when I’m trying to figure out what to do
and having some explicit guidance would help, but mostly it’s just baked
in to how I cook and eat. I don’t even think about the ducks rule, I
just see ducks and I say hello. I brush my teeth twice a day, but that’s
not a rule at all at this point it just wouldn’t occur to me not to and
it would feel wrong until I fixed it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But when you’re trying to shift who you are, particularly when you’re
trying to &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-31-18:47.html"&gt;more
reliably be the sort of person you can only sometimes be&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes
a rule and the ability to commit to it is just what you need. You’ll get
the rules wrong sometimes, and when you do you absolutely need to be
able to change them without guilt, but before you can change them you
need to follow them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Building a library of stories&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-02&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One comment I got on &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-28-12:43.html"&gt;Behaving
as if you were trying to succeed&lt;/a&gt; was that the chicken thing was a
great anecdote. I liked getting this comment, and it made me think:
“Huh, yeah. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a great anecdote. I don’t have many of
those.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think this is sortof weird. It’s not exactly like I haven’t had
plenty of things happen to me that could take the form of great
anecdotes. When I try to think of examples, I do worry that the rate of
anecdotes per year has gone down a bit. I don’t know that this is
actually true. e.g. &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/using-what-youre-given"&gt;Using
what you’re given&lt;/a&gt; is basically me telling a bunch of recent
anecdotes.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Also my current life events are a rollercoaster of
between two and five very dramatic storylines right now, it’s just that
I’m in the middle of them and they involve other people’s privacy so I
can’t exactly share them easily in public.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Certainly a lot of historic anecdotes feel… wackier. For example,
there was that time that I went to work in my pajamas. Or the time I
brought a giant frog to a wedding. More recently, I do get a lot of
mileage out of telling the story of my first date with my partners.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;It took me about halfway through the date to figure out
that I was on a date and until our second date to realise that neither I
nor they were poly prior to that point. I brought notes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But… I don’t know, I’m not sure it ever occurred to me to tell the
chicken anecdote before, and it’s not exactly a big event.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of what’s going on is that I simply don’t think of my
life in terms of well packaged stories to tell, so anecdotes come up
when I’m talking or writing about something and I pull on the thread of
something and the next thing that comes out in the chain is something
that actually happened to me. The anecdote, in this context, serves as a
tool to solve a problem, but isn’t something I necessarily experience as
a primary thing in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not, I think, unrelatedly, I have very poor narrative memory. There
are whole swathes of my life that feel just… gone. I bet they’re not
though. I bet they’re just somewhere I’m not looking. Generally I find
when I pull on a thread of thought or memory there’s quite a lot there,
it’s just not indexed in a way that I easily have access to, but if I
actually go digging I recall quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For example (look, an anecdote!) Dave and I were talking about our
seemingly-abandoned family D&amp;amp;D game the other day. We were vaguely
talking about resuming it, and he said something like “The first
challenge is anyone remembering what even happened in the last session”,
to which I said “God even I don’t remember”.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I am normally the one who remembers perfectly what
happened in the previous session and tells everyone about it at the
beginning of the session. No, I don’t know how this squares with my
belief that I have poor narrative memory either. I think it’s because
I’m using a different skill, the one where I just unwind the stack of
the conversation and perfectly tell you the thread of what we’ve been
talking about so far. It’s a weird superpower, but one I’m grateful to
have.&lt;/span&gt;
Then I said “hmmm… actually I do remember a bit, right. Jess joined us
for that one, right? She was a monk. We’d just finished making friends
with the flesh eating monster… Oh! And we fought the wizard we were
ostensibly there to rescue.” and then went on filling in more and more
details, each one becoming accessible as I remembered the bits adjacent
to it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So I think this claim that I don’t have a lot of anecdotes I can tell
is just a skill issue. Or, not even really a skill issue, a habit issue.
All the raw material is there, and I can forge it into anecdotes if I
want to, I just don’t. I’m not really sure why not.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Some of “why not?” is of course that not doing things is the default,
but there’s a sort of half formed feeling that this would be a good
thing to do, therapeutically speaking, and also just useful as a way of
improving my understanding of myself and my ability to communicate with
others.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think just starting to tell more anecdotes will probably just
result in being much better at remembering and telling stories from my
life in general. Talking about my dreams almost immediately started
causing me to remember my dreams better, and I suspect this is similar -
once you direct yourself towards some external goal, the internal
experiences that you’ve been ignoring and need for this goal suddenly
rise to the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think there’s also a sort of… fluency issue here. There’s a book by
Boris Shekhtman called “How to improve your foreign language
immediately” that I think about a lot despite not really working much on
speaking any foreign languages.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn4"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn4" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;Technically, I speak Spanish, French, and German as well
as being a native English speaker. In practice, I speak all of these at
such a bad level that I’d be unable to claim with a straight face that I
really spoke them. I have been able to hold very basic conversations in
German in the past, did get an A at French GCSE, and have been the least
bad person at communicating with a waitress in Spanish in Mexico, but
that was more because I was able to speak Spanish badly with confidence
where everyone else around me was too shy. Oh, look, another anecdote.&lt;/span&gt; In particular one of the
things he recommends is developing “islands of competence” - areas where
you’ve gamed out a lot of the conversation in advance, where you’ve
memorised certain set phrases, filled in gaps of your vocabulary,
etc.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Practicing telling specific anecdotes feels like it’s adopting this
strategy more broadly, because it helps you find interesting talking
points about your life, and helps connect you up to a kind of fluency in
living that feels hard to access sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I’m not quite sure how this will works. Consider this post more a
declaration to experiment than a well articulated thesis.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Threads of existence&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-03&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I have a sort of running “joke” that I don’t have chronic fatigue,
I’m just… fatigued… chronically. Same with pain. Similarly I’m not
disabled, it’s just that sometimes I can’t walk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I don’t have depersonalisation…&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Someone on discord recently described my writing as:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this guy has actually thought about the most basic mechanics of
“being a person in the world”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons I have to do that is that I don’t feel very good
at being a person, and I’m having to figure it out the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I genuinely don’t think I actually meet many (any?) of the diagnostic
criteria for depersonalisation, but there’s definitely some sort of
background feeling of… what would it like to actually just effortlessly
be a person?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To be clear, I’m not actually under any illusions about whether I am
or am not a person, and don’t actually benefit from external
reassurances about this. I’m factually clear on the empirical question
of my personhood. But it doesn’t feel like I’m very good at it, and I
don’t trust external observers’ opinions on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reason I don’t trust external observers here is that I think
people rarely notice this about me, because I’m highly functional in
short bursts and in company, and so this adds up to seeming extremely
like a person in any externally observable scenario. But what that feels
like from the inside is that I &lt;a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/cohering-and-decohering"&gt;cohere&lt;/a&gt;
when observed or otherwise prompted to by circumstances, but can’t
easily do so under my own steam, and by default just collapse into a
sort of decohered blob that left to its own devices will just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2022-01-06-12:00.html"&gt;drift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;If you’re wondering if that’s related to the
aforementioned definitely-don’t-have-chronic-fatigue, yeah me too. I
don’t know how much, or in which direction, but it sure seems like a
thing. If you’re thinking “gosh David, it sure sounds like what you’re
describing is depression”, yes I know. I did start by talking about a
key major common diagnostic feature of depression after all…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It feels, almost, like having a self that lacks object permanence.
It’s not there if someone isn’t looking. And, sure, it’s relatively
stable in its characteristics each fresh time it exists, because it’s
made out of roughly the same parts each time, but it still went through
a phase of not existing and coming back into existence, with a
discontinuity between those two things.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this seems bad, and I’d like to fix it. In some ways, fixing
it is probably a core feature of my project, although I don’t know that
I’ve done a very good job of that.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I tend to think of my personal project as something more
like “Figure out how to be less depressed”, but it has a lot of details
and pulls in a lot of life in general&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Part of fixing it is just &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-31-18:47.html"&gt;finding
more circumstances in which I can cohere&lt;/a&gt;, but I think another bigger
part is a sort of… OK, sometimes you’re not a person. That’s normal.
Going to sleep for example is a legitimate interruption in continuity.
Or sometimes you just lose yourself in flow in a way that interrupts
your conscious awareness of what’s going on, or get drunk, or are ill,
or… You get the idea. If an enduring sense of self requires full
continuity, you’re never going to have it.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think the analogy to object permanence is interesting, because the
thing about lacking object permanence is that &lt;em&gt;objects actually are
permanent&lt;/em&gt;. The fact that they cease to exist for you in between
viewings doesn’t actually mean they cease to exist. What’s lacking is
not a permanence to their existence, but your sense of that permanence
as a unified thing.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think part of how you build that unity between different fragments
of yourself across time is that you start to build links between them.
Part of what’s interesting about the &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-03-30-11:41.html"&gt;attitude
to commitments&lt;/a&gt; I’m trying to foster is that it is casting a link
forward in the future between yourself now and who you will be. Being
able to do this reliably starts to help you feel that you will continue
to exist in the future as an entity contiguous with who you are now. You
are, but actually being able to act on that helps you &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html"&gt;alieve&lt;/a&gt;
that.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2025-04-02-18:59.html"&gt;telling
stories about your life&lt;/a&gt; is likely the other part of this link, and
it’s part of why I’m trying to figure out how to explore that. In much
the same ways commitments cast a link forward, a story casts a link
backwards, connecting up who you are now with who you were then.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre has this notion of “narrative identity” as the
thing that constitutes selfhood. I haven’t read much about this, though
I do keep vaguely intending to. I guess I’m gesturing at something like
that, although I’m not sure we’re talking about exactly the same sort of
thing. I don’t think you can view self as wholly constituted by
narrative, but I do think that narrative is perhaps an important tool
for building a skeleton that a self can grow on top of.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why do you do things?</title>
    <updated>2025-04-04T13:33:00+01:00</updated>
    <content type="html">

&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;Why do you do things?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;dl class="metadata"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Published&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd class="post-date"&gt;2025-04-04&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I recently watched CJTheX’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZg_36utl2w"&gt;6 Shapes of God&lt;/a&gt;.
I don’t really know if I recommend it or not. I recommend giving it a go
and either you’ll find it weirdly compelling and watch it or you won’t
want to watch it and both are fine outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the things they talk about in it, partially rooted in some
work by the philosopher Harry Frankfurt that I’m passingly familiar
with&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn1"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn1" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;And really should read more of. I find Frankfurt a bit
dry, but generally he makes really interesting points about stuff I care
about.&lt;/span&gt; is that there’s a sort of division
into “instrumental ends” (e.g. I want to make money) and “terminal ends”
(I want to have fun) that is natural to make, and also is sortof fake,
because we also take on our “terminal ends” for instrumental reasons: If
we didn’t have something to strive for, we’d be bored.&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn2"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn2" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think I might here be conflating Harry Frankfurt’s
views with Elijah Millgram’s “On being bored out of your mind”, but in
my defence that paper is specifically building on Frankfurt’s work
here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Frankfurt&lt;label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number" for="fn3"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input class="margin-toggle" id="fn3" type="checkbox"/&gt;&lt;span class="sidenote"&gt;I think.&lt;/span&gt; introduces the idea of “maeutic”
ends - ends which lead to you taking on other ends in order to achieve
them. e.g. you might want to be happy, but merely aiming directly at
happiness doesn’t work. In order to achieve happiness, the most
effective means is to find something that can matter to you for its own
sake, and then &lt;em&gt;sincerely take that on as an end&lt;/em&gt;, and happiness
will emerge. e.g. when deciding what to do with your life, you might
decide to be a doctor because that seems fulfilling to you, but you
can’t be a doctor to seek fulfillment and expect to be fulfilled, you
need to decide that being a doctor genuinely matters. You might later
decide that it is not if it’s making you miserable and lacks the
qualities that matter to you, but in the moment your day-to-day reason
has to be about the end of &lt;em&gt;being a doctor&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;being a
doctor in order to be fulfilled&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The instrumental/terminal distinction is still useful though, it’s
just important to understand that “why?” answers are weird and
defeasible and necessarily incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Why did you eat that cake? Because it was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you look at this as a sort of pure logical syllogism sort of
answer&lt;/p&gt;
