<p class="subtitle">Books should be taken seriously but not literally</p>

<p>fvathynevgl (I've got official sanction to pronounce this "Vathy" if that's helpful to you in reading this post without demonic incursions) has <a href="https://www.fvathynevgl.com/cooperative-spherical-cows/">written about cooperative spherical cows</a> as a model of various self-help ideologies:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Cooperative spherical cow philosophies postulate a certain model of human behaviour and give advice on how to fix your relationships. Unfortunately, whether the advice works is conditional on all humans adhering to the ideal model, which they don't.</p>
<p>All cooperative spherical cow philosophies have a hidden precondition which makes them applicable in the real world. If it is mentioned in a book at all, it will be as an off-hand remark or digression, accepted at face value and not explored in depth. You can tell it's a hidden precondition because it makes the philosophy no longer look like a silver bullet.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is somewhat in response to The Courage to be Disliked which I wrote about in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html">suspension of annoyance</a>. Apparently <a href="https://twitter.com/fvathynevgl/status/1237666299146272768">the timing is a coincidence</a>.</p>


<p>Anyway, I agree with their post, I just think that it's only true under hidden preconditions that makes it look applicable in the real world.</p>


<p>OK, that's unfair, but I couldn't resist the opportunity for the line. My more nuanced counterbalance to the post is this: Books like they are describing work best when you take them seriously but not literally, and the failure mode they are describing only occurs if you take them literally. If you read the books described and get religion over them and try to apply them verbatim to your life, it will likely go very badly for you, but the solution is just not to do that.</p>


<p>This is a good thing to point out, because a lot of people do take books literally and get religion over them, and this reliably goes badly. I have likely been undercautious with my book recommendations as a result because I've assumed people have a better attitude to reading than they do, and will update accordingly.</p>


<p>That being said... I think this is, similarly, a post that should be taken seriously and not literally, because it will cause you to miss out on a lot of useful ideas.
There is enough <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-16-14:22.html">ghost knowledge</a> out there without also ignoring that which is written down.
The books fvathynevgl recommends sound good, and I intend to read them, but only being able to extract knowledge from impeccable sources is a severe limitation that I cannot really recommend.</p>


<p>As a side note, I am also interested as to why exactly these books are not best sellers if they are so much better than the books that are best sellers.
This is not a disagreement with fvathynevgl, I'm just genuinely curious. Is there a need that the others are filling that these are not?</p>


<p>Anyway, here is my base recommendation for how to engage with books:</p>


<ol>
<li>The author is <em>always</em> overly convinced of the truth and usefullness of their position. If they weren't, they wouldn't be writing the book. You cannot rely on them to provide the necessary preconditions, to the point where even if they do provide those preconditions you should <em>still</em> assume you need to figure them out on your own.</li>
<li>The author is a nerd about the subject, in the sense outlined in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">my post on nerding</a>. They are much more interested in the subject than you are, and all of their advice has the precondition3. The book is a book. As such, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-18-12:24.html">the books you create out of it in your head</a> are more interesting than the book as an actual physical or digital object.</li>
<li>The book is best treated not as a source of truth but as a textual artefact that you are examining.</li>
<li>The artefact is an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html">existence proof</a> of a particular sort of mindset. You're not trying to adopt that mindset for daily use, but by being able to engage with it and figure out what it's like you are more prepared to adapt the tools from it.</li>
</ol>


<p>In order to treat books as artefacts of study rather than sources of truth you need to have reliable belief formation skills (so that you don't get lead in bad directions), and you need to have confidence that you do (so that reading things that are not true <em>feels</em> safe as well as <em>is</em> safe).</p>


<p>Recommended starting points for this: <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-09-11:13.html">Don't believe things unless you can act on them</a>, and then <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">experiment with those beliefs and see how it pans out</a>.
You will rapidly find the preconditions for applicability of anything you learn from books when you do this, and you will do so much more reliably than anything the authors tell you about those preconditions.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Suspension of annoyance</p>


<dl class="metadata">

<p>I've been banging on a bit about "<a href="https://amzn.to/38I7D5z">The Courage to be Disliked</a>" since <a href="https://twitter.com/m_ashcroft/">Michael Ashcroft</a> recommended it.
My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/rixxtr">Tobi</a> read it as a result, and the following is his review from <a href="https://discord.gg/jm97tDN">bookchat discord</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I finished The Courage to be Disliked. It's a thoroughly annoying book, obnoxiously written, and I strongly disagree with a whole lot of what it says. At the same time it has been extremely useful to me, in an immediate and actionable way, and I'm very glad I've read it.</p>
<p>Useful, yet punchable.</p>
<p>I only found this thread on Twitter afterwards, and it contains pretty much all of the book without the obnoxiousness: <a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1037715339314847747">https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1037715339314847747</a></p>
</blockquote>


<p>I cannot disagree with this review. The book is objectively very annoying. However I was not particularly annoyed while reading it.</p>


<p>Part of this I've had practice. The particular foibles of this book were new to me, but I've read a lot of self-help and niche (especially trauma centric) therapy books recently, which has allowed me to get used to a particular style: That of a slightly self-obsessed author telling you their life story and the transformation they've been through, wrapped around what would probably be a fairly decent essay about a useful technique threaded through the entire thing in a way that makes it slightly hard to skip reading about the journey.</p>


<p>(I said I wasn't annoyed while <em>reading</em> the books, not that I wasn't annoyed about the books)</p>


<p>When reading those books, I could look for things to argue with. It wouldn't be hard. The books are full of poorly supported pseudoscience, weak arguments, and irrelevant digressions. But I knew they would be going in, so why worry about it? I'm there to see if I can extract anything interesting from the book. I don't really care about whether the author is right or wrong, and I expect they're mostly wrong, but I can still try to derive some useful insights from their work.</p>


<p>To go a bit Adlerian about this, what purpose is the annoyance with the book serving you?</p>


<p>I think it's mostly protective: Someone is saying wrong things, and you want to treat it as someone arguing with you, because if you were to take on the wrong things you would go on to believe wrong things, and that's bad.</p>


<p>But you could just do neither of those things. Don't read the book on the assumption that you'll believe anything the author has to say, but also don't be annoyed when you don't.</p>


<p>Instead, take on the information that this is what the author believes. Acknowledge the possibility that some of it <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">might be worth trying</a>, but don't read it with any greater expectation of truth than that.
Once you've done that, the protective mechanism of annoyance is not especially useful,
and you might as well just choose not to do that.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Homophily and the tyranny of false positives</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-10</dd>
</dl>


<p>A while ago a friend of mine told me about what he called his Terribly Goth Theory of Friendship:
You can't trust people who don't have problems.</p>


<p>The reason is of course that <em>we</em> have problems, and that it's hard to trust people without them to know how to handle that well.</p>


<p>I think it goes deeper than that: Actually many people with fewer or different problems than ours are in fact perfectly lovely human beings who we would get on fine with, but we can't tell that.
So we select for people who are like us because we can predict how they will react.
This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily">homophily</a>, the tendency to hang out with people like us. </p>


<p>In general, the question of who to be friends with is a classic example of the sort of thing I talked about in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/02/theres-no-single-error-rate/">there's no single error rate</a>, where the only error rate that is visible to you is the false positive rate. As I argued in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-22-11:37.html">you should try bad things</a> this will tend to cause you to narrow your selection over time:
If you only ever update to remove false positives, you will tend to increase the degree of homophily you exhibit.</p>


<p>This isn't necessarily a bad thing at the individual level, but bear in mind the way that bad rejections (false negatives) can contain <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/06/the-ethics-of-false-negatives-in-interviewing/">systemic biases</a>.
My suspicion is that a lot of communities will tend to become more homogenous over time purely as a result of this effect: People who don't match the community expectations will tend to get filtered out, not necessarily because they're a bad fit, but because they don't act like the kind of people the community understands how to tell if they're a fit or not.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The art of not having opinions</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-09</dd>
</dl>


<p>In the same conversation with Dave that lead to us <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">talking about which way people veer to avoid collisions</a> we ended up playing a sort of game.</p>


<p>For context: Dave works in transport. Transport is something we all encounter on a very regular basis, so we all tend to think about it a lot. However, transport is a complex system, so it's <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html">more broken</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-11:43.html">less comprehensible</a> than you might intuitively expect it to be. As a result, most people's opinions on transport are <em>bad</em>.</p>


<p>So, the game: I had to keep coming up with transport opinions I held, and Dave would judge if they were bad opinions.</p>


<p>Eventually we ran out of time or got distracted or something (I forget) and I made it to that point without having any bad opinions. I was quite pleased by this.</p>


<p>Another place I was pleased with myself recently was my performance on the <a href="https://programs.clearerthinking.org/common_misconceptions.html">common misconceptions</a> test. The number of things I got right was only so so (I forget exactly, but I think about 85% right?), but I was almost perfectly calibrated: The ones where my confidence was high were right, the ones where my confidence was low were right in about the proportion they should be.
This was a bit surprising to me, as in the past I have definitely not been that well calibrated on similar things.</p>


<p>I think these both happened for fairly general reasons: Over the last decade, I've gotten much better at not having opinions on things.</p>


<p>This might be surprising to you, as I have a <em>lot</em> of opinions, but it makes sense: I've not gotten better at having fewer opinions, I've gotten better at not having opinions on any given thing unless it makes sense for me to do so.</p>


<p>There's a lot of social pressure against doing this.
We basically use having opinions at eachother as a social bonding activity to make sure that the person we're talking to has the "right" sort of politics, so there's a lot of social pressure against this, but I think it's worth doing if we want our opinions to be truth tracking.</p>


<p>Two useful prompts for recalibrating opinions:</p>


<ol>
<li>Is it <em>useful</em> for me to have an opinion on this? If not, why do I have one?</li>
<li>If this opinion were wrong, would I be able to tell?</li>
</ol>


<p>If the answer to either of these is no, why are you having an opinion on it? At the very least, you should be less confident in asserting it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">You can't actually explain everything to laypeople</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-08</dd>
</dl>


<p>There's an annoying meme that, as with many annoying memes oft-cited by nerds, seems to date back to Feynmann.
It's that your ability to explain a subject to a layperson is a test of whether you understand it.
I often hear it as "If you can't explain it to your grandmother you don't understand it". The version I heard earlier was "explain to a five year old".</p>


<p>Feynmann, to his partial credit, doesn't seem to have deliberately coined an aphorism here and also said "freshman" (i.e. first year university student). <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Richard_Feynman#Teaching_quote">Discussion at wikiquote</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Feynman was a truly great teacher. He prided himself on being able to devise ways to explain even the most profound ideas to beginning students. Once, I said to him, "Dick, explain to me, so that I can understand it, why spin one-half particles obey Fermi-Dirac statistics." Sizing up his audience perfectly, Feynman said, "I'll prepare a freshman lecture on it." But he came back a few days later to say, "I couldn't do it. I couldn't reduce it to the freshman level. That means we don't really understand it."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Freshman students are already not laypeople, but even so I don't think this is a reasonable standard for understanding.
It <em>might</em> be a reasonable standard for the specific context, I don't know enough about quantum mechanics to say, but it's certainly not universal.</p>


<p>But first, lets consider how freshmen already differ from laypeople:</p>


<ol>
<li>They've got a lot of prerequisites that a layperson doesn't. A freshman in a physics lecture already knows a lot more about physics than a five year old, or indeed most educated people.</li>
<li>They're prepared to learn and engage with the material.</li>
</ol>


<p>(2) is one of the most important parts, because the main reason that you can't explain most things you do to laypeople is that they don't care. When someone who isn't a software developer / computer scientists / etc asks me about my PhD I can just about explain the problem before they switch off (which honestly is doing better than most PhDs in computer science, but I have a relatively accessible problem domain), I'm certainly not going to get them to sit through an explanation about the solution.</p>


<p>(1) is also a major feature: Some areas of knowledge just have prerequisites. It's a simple fact. And often there are a lot more prerequisites than you think. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-18-12:24.html">How to talk about books you haven't read</a> has a great section on reading Hamlet to the Tiv tribe in Western Africa, and how much cultural bridging that required. Hamlet is pretty much designed to be accessible to laypeople (Shakespeare was a popular entertainer!) but because these are laypeople from a different cultural context, it failed to land without a lot of explanation.</p>


<p>My degree is in mathematics. There were a number of courses in the final year I struggled with, though I generally got there in the end. If you had thrown me in the deep end on those courses in my first year, I would have had no chance, because they built on material that I had learned earlier.
Knowledge has prerequisites, and you have to teach those first.</p>


<p>Could I have somehow taught those courses to my younger self anyway? Certainly. I'd have done it by putting him through a four year maths degree.</p>


<p>This is, in the end, the biggest problem with the idea that you can teach anything to laypeople:
Sometimes the only way to do that is to first make them not a layperson.</p>
