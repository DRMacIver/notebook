<p class="subtitle">A Guide to Starting a Daily Writing Practice</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-08</dd>
</dl>


<p>Apparently I'm now <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265999121057546242">that guy who gets people to start daily writing practices</a>, so here's a daily writing about daily writing practices.</p>


<h3>The short version</h3>


<p>The daily writing practice I'd advocate for is to write at least one sentence, as close to every day as you can manage, in a location that gives you the opportunity to easily write something closer to a short essay should you choose to do so. Ideally this would be in public, under a pseudonym if you prefer, but if you can't bring yourself to do that it's also find to write <em>as if</em> it were intended for other people to read but to do it somewhere in private.</p>


<p>The rest of this post will be some guidance on how to make this work for you.</p>


<h3>What is the purpose of the practice?</h3>


<p>The purpose of the practice is to write every day and enjoy doing so. That's it.</p>


<p>There are some <em>additional benefits</em> of the practice, but the practice is in and of itself supposed to be an enjoyable thing which puts something out into the world that would otherwise not be there.</p>


<p>Additional benefits include:</p>


<ul>
<li>It will improve your writing skills, and your communication skills in general, by giving you a place to practice writing.</li>
<li>It will help resolve writing anxiety. You are probably much better at writing than you think you are, but writing feels hard not because writing <em>is</em> hard but because you have a lot of associated anxiety with it (school does that to you). By getting to regularly experience writing as relatively easy, you'll start to drain some of that anxiety.</li>
<li>You will likely find you have a lot of thoughts that were not getting expressed, and a daily writing practice gives you somewhere to express them.</li>
<li>Daily writing is a good place to think. It doesn't <em>force</em> you to think deeply, but it gives you a place where you can develop your skills for deep thought should you choose to do so. You will almost certainly become a better thinker through a daily writing practice.</li>
<li>By writing daily you'll start to notice themes across your writing, and you can begin to draw them out, connecting up your knowledge and thouhts better.</li>
<li>If you share it, people will find your writing useful. They probably won't find <em>all</em> your writing useful - the point of a daily practice is that you get to write stuff that's not very good, and that's fine - but I'm sorry to inform you that if you write every day over a sustained period of time (months, certainly, but probably even within your first week) you're doomed to write something that people actually like.<ul>
<li>This is good for them, obviously.</li>
<li>It's also good for you. People will say nice things about you. You will like that.</li>
<li>It may also spark interesting conversations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Success criteria</h3>


<p>Success is writing one sentence, almost every day, and feeling neutral to positive about having done so.</p>


<p>Most days you will probably find yourself writing more than one sentence. If you only ever write one sentence you should probably try to write more some days, but I find writing more tends to come naturally for people and writing only a sentence every day is probably a sign that you're not enjoying the practice rather than a problem in and of itself,
so I wouldn't worry about length too much.
Success on any given day is just the one sentence.</p>


<p>It doesn't even have to be a good sentence.
Success in your daily writing practice does not require any quality. If you're putting it in public somewhere you can explicitly signal that it is <em>practice</em> - a lot of us are using blogs like this one labelled "notebook" to indicate that the writing is just some thoughts that we're writing down. You can write high quality stuff if you want to from time to time, but it's not required for success.</p>


<p>You probably won't write literally every day. Missing a day is fine. If you're missing a lot of days (more than about one a week on any sort of recurring basis, say) then something is up and you should figure out what that is and what to do about it. Don't beat yourself up about it - it means something about the practice isn't working for you, and you should treat figuring that out as a practical problem to solve. Chances are you're setting too high a bar for yourself.</p>


<p>You shouldn't hate your practice. If you hate your practice, you're probably either setting your standards too high, or you're uncovering some uncomfortable feelings around writing that it might be worth examining (may I recommend <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-03-09:56.html">some useful emotion management principles</a>?).
If it's the latter, remind yourself that this practice is successful if and only if you hit this incredibly low bar, and that it's a good practice to do, and that you can set aside your normal standards for writing while doing it.</p>


<h3>Failure criteria</h3>


<p>I want to be very clear on this: It is OK to try a writing practice and give it up. Beginning a daily writing practice does not oblige you to continue a daily writing practice.</p>


<p>My recommendation would be that if after a month you have not been able to make it work for you in the sense above - i.e. writing almost every day and enjoying it - then you should quit. Additionally, throughout that month you should be actively looking at any problems you run into and trying to solve them. If you get properly stuck feel free to ask me for advice.</p>


<p>The month is just an arbitrary deadline. If prior to that point you decide that the writing practice is making you miserable, and you cannot figure out how to solve that, quit earlier obviously. I'd recommend perseverance if it's at worstnot quite working for you, but I'd also recommend trying to figure out why it's not working for you and seeing if you can fix that.</p>


<h3>Prompts</h3>


<p>One of the most important things to maintaining a daily writing practice is that there should never be any uncertainty if you <em>can</em> do the writing today, and the key to that is to have a good set of prompts for writing.</p>


<p>My favourite prompt is to find some interesting passage of writing, copy it out, and add commentary. The commentary can be any sort of thought prompted by it, or if you're stuck for what to say you can just explain what the passage is about, provide context, etc. </p>


<p>This passage can come from anywhere - something you've read recently, a tweet you've seen, a conversation you've had, but my personal favourite procedure is to use random pages from books. This goes like this:</p>


<ol>
<li>Pick a book, ideally one that you've read. I prefer using physical books for this, but it's doable with ebooks. I randomize the book selection but it might be helpful to set aside a favourite novel for this as the default if you don't have anything you want to use on a given day.</li>
<li>Pick a random page within that book, either by flicking through it or using a random number generator such as <a href="https://www.random.org/">random.org</a>.</li>
<li>Find an interesting passage on that page and use that (possibly continuing on to the next page, or scanning back to the previous one for the start of a passage). If nothing catches your eye, pick another page. If still nothing catches your eye, pick another book.</li>
</ol>


<p>I find this is a <em>very</em> reliable prompt for being able to write something even when I'm not feeling it.</p>


<p>Another prompt that I've been enjoying reading but haven't tried myself is that Lisa has been doing <a href="https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/series/drabble/">drabbles</a> - picking a topic in philosophy (you can pick your own area, Lisa is a philosopher) and writing 100 word explanations of that topic.</p>


<p>Another useful thing is to keep a file of things that you could write about at some point and if you're stuck on any given day, scroll through that file and see if any of them catch your eye. I've not been using this much recently since I started using the book prompt as my default, but it's been very helpful in the past and if the book idea doesn't work for you then try this.</p>


<h3>How long should it take</h3>


<p>You should tailor your writing to how long you have. If you don't have long, the prompts are important.</p>


<p>For me I rarely spend less than 15 minutes on it, and even more rarely spend more than an hour on it (this post is unusually long to write because I'm trying to explain something specific rather than just rambling on a prompt, so it might take almost an hour to write).</p>


<p>Key to this is the low quality aspect. Daily writing involves almost minimal editing. If you want an editing practice, that's separate.</p>


<h3>Things to watch out for</h3>


<p>The notebook blog is supposed to be an enjoyable thing that you can keep up indefinitely. It can stop being this long before it "fails" and in order to avoid it,
it's worth watching out for some things:</p>


<ul>
<li>taking too long over posts.</li>
<li>starting to put off writing posts, or not wanting to write them.</li>
<li>doing a lot of editing.</li>
</ul>


<p>The easiest way to have this is by writing too many good posts! It's very easy to let your standards creep too high, and you won't be able to sustain that indefinitely. It's good to write good posts from time to time, but you're not going to be able to do it every day.</p>


<p>My recommendation is that to counteract this you should deliberately half-arse your posts at least a couple days per week. Pick a prompt and do the bare minimum amount of work needed to fulfill it.</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>


<p>You should avoid any nontrivial activation energy for getting started and just start. Pick wherever to write is the lowest effort for you to do so, don't try to do anything complicated to get set up.</p>


<p>Social media is not generally a good choice for this. Twitter, or Facebook, are not very good for the essay format, and I do think it is important to write somewhere where you could write longer posts if you wanted to.</p>


<p>My ideal recommendation is to start a blog or a newsletter somewhere. I've been enjoying Substack for <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/">my newsletter</a>. If you're at all programmery doing a static site on GitHub pages is also a good way to go, otherwise <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> is a good option. <a href="https://reading.supply/">reading.supply</a> seems nice but I haven't used it (and it's currently difficult to subscribe to if you've not got an account there, but that may be a feature depending on how shy you're feeling).</p>


<p>Also, you should get started now. Step away from this post, set up a place to write, and then write something.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A Meta For Computers</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>I use metaphors of legacy code and refactoring a lot, and this works very well but is comprehensible more or less in direct proportion to how well you understand software development.
It turns out that a lot of people I know understand software development well enough to benefit from this, but by no means all.</p>


<p>I was trying to think about how to explain this to other people, and I ended up with what I think is a reasonably pleasing way to explain how computers and software work in general.</p>


<p>So, here's the metaphor I want to use: Think of a computer as a kind of archive, but you're not allowed in to the archive, you can only access it through someone at the front desk. We'll call him Steve.</p>


<p>Behind the scenes the archive has a bunch of people working in it. When you ask Steve to do something, he doesn't do it himself, he just passes on appropriate orders to the people working there, they carry out the orders, bring something back to him, and he hands it over to you. Steve is not the one who is fulfilling your commands, he's just the interface to it.</p>


<p>Now due to regulations, the archive runs on <em>very</em> strict rules. There's a rule for everything, a protocol to every request. Steve and the workers in it <em>will</em> not violate the rules, no matter how much you plead. It's more than their job's worth, don't you know?</p>


<p>As long as you stick within the scenarios the rules are designed for this is mostly pretty well.
You bring Steve a document and ask him to file it. He says "Certainly, I'll file this as document XYZ-1234" or some other ID, hands it to the a clerk, who files it appropriately.
When you want it back you say "Steve, can I have document XYZ-1234?" and he passes on the request to a relevant clerk, they fetch the document and hand it back to you. The system is working as intended.</p>


<p>Suppose one day you come in and you've forgotten the ID of the document you want. "Steve, can I have the document I gave you on Wednesday?".
Steve can't do that. "The document I gave you on Wednesday" is not a request that the system has rules for, so he's not allowed to fulfill it.</p>


<p>Eventually, after consulting the rule book as to what sort of queries you <em>are</em> allowed to make, you ask Steve to give you all documents filed by you on 2020-06-03. You filed only one document on that date (the Wednesday in question), so Steve hands you the document on Wednesday.</p>


<p>This is what interacting with a computer is like: The computer is a system of rules that is there to do things you find useful, but everything you want to do with it has to be thought of and accounted for in advance.
Sometimes the rules are so complicated as to <em>seem</em> more sophisticated than that, but they're not they're just a really complicated rule system. Sometimes the rules contain rules for changing the rules (this is what programming is), but you're still constrained to follow the rules.</p>


<p>The fact that they're rules doesn't mean they're perfectly predictable of course. You can have rules for things like "Give me a random file" which involves a clerk drawing a card, rolling dice, etc. You can also have rules like "Send two clerks to do A and B and give me whichever result comes back" and the result will depend on which workers implement the task, whether they're having good days, etc. The rules can, in general, <em>underdetermine</em> the result, but they do specify how the result must be obtained.</p>


<h3>What does a crash look like?</h3>


<p>One day you go to Steve and you say "Steve, can you attach this note to document QP-567?". As per usual, Steve sends a Clerk off to get the document. As he goes through the procedure to attach the note to it for you, he pauses, a horrified look crosses his face, and he breaks down crying, without attaching the note.</p>


<p>You ask him what's wrong, but he can't tell you: There's no rule for that. Also, Steve now won't answer any of your other questions, because the rules don't allow him to proceed until he's completed your request.</p>


<p>Eventually, frustrated, you go to Kim, the administrator, who is in charge of managing the rules of the archive and ask them to look into it. After a while of investigating (they have a bunch of special privileges that allow them to ask Steve WTF is going on) they tell you that the problem is that the document you've asked for doesn't have an associated date or author, and that as part of their procedures Steve has to record those as part of the log of your request when handing you a document. The document you attempted to attach a note to came from before they were recording that information on entry, and the recording rules came in after recording that information was mandatory, so don't account for this possibility.</p>


<p>Kim updates the rules and tells you they've fixed the problem. You ask Steve to attach the note to QP-567 again. He informs you that you don't have permission to do that.</p>


<p>You are less than impressed by this response and ask Kim what's up with it. They inform you that this seemed like the logical fix: If attaching a note a document requires this information, you must not be allowed to attach notes to documents that lack it. You patiently explain that this is all very well but you need to attach the note to the document from and don't actually care about their recording requirements.
Why is that rule even there?</p>


<p>Kim consults Janet, the interface to their archive where they record information about the changes in the rules of the archive you want to manage, and after a number of queries comes to the following conclusion: The recording requirement doesn't seem to have been introduced for any particularly good reason, but all sorts of <em>other</em> rules and procedures depend on it now, so it's really hard to change.</p>


<p>After a bit of back and forth and arguing about how important it is for you to be able to actually add notes to documents in the archive anyway, you hit on a solution: When attaching a note to such a document, Steve will record it as having been authored by "Unknown" at the date of the creation of the archive.</p>


<p>You can now attach the note to the document.</p>


<h3>What does legacy code look like?</h3>


<p>One day you request a document and you get the wrong one back.</p>


<p>You go to Kim and ask what's up with that. "Jesus, I have no idea, document retrieval is <em>complicated</em>."</p>


<p>You express a certain amount of surprise about this. From your perspective you just give Steve the ID and he comes back to you with a document. What could be simpler?</p>


<p>So Kim sits you down and explains to you the realities of archiving.</p>


<p>First you have to understand, an archive is not some abstract place. These documents you're handing to Steve? They have to <em>go</em> somewhere. There are all these big rooms where the documents have to literally, physically, go. Although those rooms are big, there are a lot of documents, so sometimes rooms fill up and you have to build other rooms.</p>


<p>So, when you look up a document, first someone has to look up in an index somewhere to find out what room to look in for it. This was reasonable simple up until a couple of years ago when the size of the index got too large for the room they were storing it in, so now the index is split across multiple rooms. So first they have a procedure to figure out which index to look at.</p>


<p>This is all made more complicated by the fact that the ID system has changed multiple times over the lifetime of the archive, so depending on which room it's in and what ID system was in use when the item was entered into the archive you need different ways of looking it up (some rooms the documents are stored ordered by author, some by title, some by publication year, and this affects how you find a document there and is taken into account in the ID).</p>


<p>In order to illustrate their point, Kim shows you the rules for looking up a document. They span three books. They are not small books.</p>


<p>Eventually after making yourself enough of a nuisance, Kim acknowledges that yes of the dozen things they had to do today obviously your document is the most important thing they could be working on,
and so they go to Steve and ask him to walk them through how exactly the document was retrieved.</p>


<p>Eventually, after much deliberation, they determine that the problem is that it was looked up using the wrong ID system.
You see, the way they determine which ID system to use is based on the date the document was entered into the archive. If there is no entry date, they try all of the different ways in which it could have been entered (there are three from before the system started requiring recording the entry date) and if there is more than one document they ask the person requesting the document to resolve the ambiguity.</p>


<p>But the last time someone atached a note to this document, Steve noticed it didn't have an entry date, so as per the new rules implemented in response to your complaint before, set its entry date to the beginning of the archive. So now there is no ambiguity in what ID system it is using, but unfortunately it's a much more recent document than that, so it's unambiguously using the wrong one.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Testing Positive For vs Having</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-06</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2A9stPS">Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences</a> by Bowker and Star, page 176:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>...it was decided that those who tested positive did not <em>have</em> [tuberculosis], they were "considered to have tuberculous infection but not the disease" (<em>Diagnosis</em> 1955, 15). Only those who could bring other evidence of disease to the table would be considered worthy of the classification of pulmonary or nonpulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is an interesting distinction. It reminds me of the distinction between HIV (the virus) and AIDS (the condition caused by the virus).</p>


<p>More generally, and tangentially, though I think we are seeing people becoming increasingly aware of the distinction between testing positive and having a disease in another way: You might test positive and just not have the disease. Equally, you might test negative and still have the disease.</p>


<p>I've written before in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/02/theres-no-single-error-rate/">There's no single error rate</a> about how you need to think about error quite carefully, and that for any classification scheme there is an error rate per possible answer. In this case you can incorrectly say that someone does not have the disease, and you can incorrectly say that they do.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2015897">This is a good article about the error rates in testing and what they mean</a> for diagnosis.</p>


<p>I know at least two people who have tested negative for COVID-19 but still seem pretty likely to have had it, due to symptoms and circumstances. That's not to say that you should <em>ignore</em> the fact that there's a negative result - it should certainly make you seem less likely to have it - but it's far from indisputable proof.</p>


<p>I think I'm pretty likely to have had it. I'm currently saying 90% likely (this is a made up number, but I'm pretty good - albeit far from perfect - at making up numbers to gauge my level of confidence).</p>


<p>So what would it mean if I got tested with an antibody test for whether I've had it?</p>


<p>Although I'm generally quite thumbs down on Bayesianism, this is an example where Bayes rule (well, conditional probability anyway) is obviously the correct thing to do as a way to reason about testing. If we make up more numbers and assume that the probability of a negative result given that I <em>am</em> infected is 10%, and the probability of a negative result given that I'm <em>not</em> infected is 95% (i.e. 5% of noninfected people will falsely get a positive result), then I assign 9% confidence to being infected and getting a negative result (90% chance I'm infected multiplied by 10% chance that if I'm infected I get a negative result) and a 9.5% chance that I'm not infected and get a negative result (90% chance of not infected, 95% chance that if I'm not infected I'll get a negative result), so for a total of 18.5% chance of a negative result.</p>


<p>Note that, because of my high prior confidence that I've been infected, it's almost as likely that I get a negative result but still have it as that I get a negative result and don't have it. Specifically, if I get a negative result the chances of my having it are \(100 \times \frac{9}{9 + 9.5} \approx 48.6\%\). i.e. despite the negative result I'm only barely more likely to not have it than I am to have it.</p>


<p>Does this mean that the tests are useless?</p>


<p>Well, maybe. Certainly a negative test result doesn't tell me much, but there's also not much I'd do with a negative test result anyway: A negative test result just means that I have to keep doing what I'm already doing, which is maintaining a sensible level of caution about catching the virus. Whether that's because I actually haven't had the virus, or whether it's because I've had the virus and the test wrongly reports that I have not, it doesn't really matter for my decision making - I've got no new information that would allow me to change behaviour.</p>


<p>A positive test result is potentially more useful. Suppose similar numbers: 90% of people with the virus test positive, and 5% of people without the virus test positive. After a positive result I'd be about 99% certain I'd had it, and thus that I was pretty likely immune.</p>


<p>I still wouldn't be <em>certain</em> that I had had the virus, or even that if I'd had the virus I would be immune, but behaviours that were previously unacceptable risks would now become acceptable risks.</p>


<p>This wouldn't change my behaviour much in that I'd just go out and start licking people, but it would change some of my risk profiles (I'm currently being significantly more careful than the government guidelines suggest, with one or two exceptions) and so I can use that to adjust my decisions.
I'd probably still keep away from supermarkets, but I'd probably be a lot more willing to hang out with friends outside.</p>


<p>Another use case is that even if tests are quite inaccurate at an individual level, they might be useful at a population level: If you know the false positive and false negative rates pretty well, and you implement mass testing, you can be pretty confident of the percentage of the population who have had the virus, and plan accordingly, even if you've got significant question marks about any individual person.</p>


<p>In the other direction, the government was criticised (somewhat correctly) early on for the lack of widespread testing, and widespread testing is good and important, but there was at least some reasonable logic behind not testing everyone with symptoms: If you have acute symptoms, you need to go to the hospital regardless of whether you have it, and if you don't have acute symptoms, you need to stay home regardless of whether you have it, so the test did not (at that point) add that much useful information. It is, at best, lightly informative of treatment and of the decision of whether you should be admitted to hospital. Often effective action requires triaging what information is worth acquiring.</p>


<p>(This is not to say that I think that the UK government response to COVID-19 has been anything less than shambolic, but some individual actions are not as obviously unreasonable as they seem, especially given other constraints caused by the rest of the response)</p>


<p>Ultimately I think this highlights two important things about knowledge:</p>


<ol>
<li>There is absolutely no certainty, only degrees of confidence (some of which may be so high that they might as well be certainty, but often you cannot wait until you are that certain).</li>
<li>The acceptable margins of uncertainty significantly depend on what you're going to do with the knowledge, and you'll often have to just be comfortable with the fact that you might be acting on wrong information.</li>
</ol>

<p class="subtitle">The Virtue Ethics of Potato Growing</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-05</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZB2wmE">Seeing Like a State</a> by James C. Scott, page 303:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>An explicit set of rules will take you further when the situation is cut-and-dried. The more static and one-dimensional the stereotype, the less the need for creative interpretation and adaptation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If the environment can be simplified down to the point where the rules do explain a great deal, those who formulate the rules and techniques have also greatly expanded their power.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is all part of a rather interesting discussion of potato growing in the Andes, and about how the local growers are engaged in an extensive process of adapting cultivars to the particular soil and growing conditions of their farm ("landraces" - breeds that are highly adapted to a local environment). Rather than having a small number of legible potato breeds, they have hyperlocal varieties which are only found mostly on the farm they're grown on.</p>


<p>There is a great deal of swapping of these varieties and trying them out in different locations, so the line of any given type of potato is not restricted to the farm, but each farm will the interate on the potatoes it receives, crossing them, selecting them for new conditions, etc.</p>


<p>This is contrasted with the "scientific" mode of potato production, where a cultivar is selected for particular properties in ideal conditions, and <em>then</em> you find out where it grows well, and to some large degree try to make it so that the land matches the conditions (e.g. through irrigation, fertiliser) rather than trying to match the potato to the land.</p>


<p>Brief aside: I'd like to use this to point out a way that I, and others, have I think done James C. Scott in general and "Seeing Like a State" in particular a bit of a disservice. I've been on record in the past as saying that Seeing Like a State is much longer than it needs to be and that you can get most of the important information out of one of the relevant blog posts. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Venkatesh Rao</a>'s, <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/11/shaping-the-world/">mine</a> or <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/">Scott Alexander</a>'s for example. This is in some sense true, but it's also in some sense false.</p>


<p>Seeing Like a State is not so much "too long" as "detail rich". If you're just interested in having the idea of legibility in your conceptual toolkit, it's too long and you should just read one of the blog posts. If you're interested in learning a lot of details about how the world works, both historically and geographically, it's about the right length, because it's packed with lots of these details, using legibility as a unifying theme and lens to look at them through.</p>


<p>Do you need to know about potato farming in the Andes to understand legibility? No, of course not. But potato farming in the Andes is, it turns out, <em>interesting</em>.</p>


<p>In an act of mild irony, casting "Seeing Like a State" as "the legibility book" is an attempt to make it more legible than the detail rich view on the ground would show it as.</p>


<p>Anyway, that being said, I'm going to return to the high level conceptual toolkit now.</p>


<p>I've been reading Rosalind Hursthouse's <a href="https://amzn.to/3dyWLu8">On Virtue Ethics</a>. It's excellent and I highly recommend it. I'm currently doing a <a href="https://jmestn.com/15485/naval-doesn-t-take-notes">high level first pass read</a> so I can't necessarily fairly summarise it, but one of the things I like about Virtue Ethics in general is its emphasis on becoming the sort of person who takes good actions over and above teasing out the right thing to do in any individual action, trying to come up with some sort of schema or set of rules.</p>


<p>In particular, it feels like a lot of attempts to understand ethical reasoning try to pin down things into exactly these cut and dried scenarios so that you can say "Look, here's a rule that works!".</p>


<p>Teasing out these scenarios itself isn't necessarily bad in that it can be useful for understanding what traits lead to good decisions, and what those good decisions look like, but they inevitably come with some fairly massive simplifying assumptions. For example, trolley problems work precisely by narrowing the field down until you <em>have</em> to pick one of two unpalatable options.</p>


<p>That being said, even these situations fail to make the world as simple as they'd like. I've previously proposed that the solution to trolley problems is relatively easy if you allow the possibility of incurring guilt for doing the "right" thing. If you kill the individual to save the many, you still have to deal with (at least some of) the consequences of killing the individual.</p>


<p>In general, I think, one of the high points of virtue ethics is that it is good at acknowledging that although you can reason about ethics, a lot of actual ethical behaviour has to come down to the person dealing with the messy situation on the ground, and that this problem is contiguous with practical reasoning (virtue ethicists use the word "Phronesis", meaning a sort of practical wisdom oriented around getting morally good result). Virtue ethical reasoning very much resembles the sort of messy practical reasoning that people engage in in practice with problem solving.</p>


<p>One of the interesting things in the section about potatoes is how even the idealised scientific tools get folded in to the messy practical realities of making the world work for the farmer:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[...] the vast majority of Andean cultivators are neither purely traditional cultivators nor mindless followers of the scientific specialists. They are, instead, crafting unique alamagams of strategies that reflect their ams, their resources, and their local conditions. Where the new potatoes seem to fit their purposes, they may plant some, but they may interplant them with other cultivars and may substitute dung, or plow in green manure (alfalfa, clover) rather than apply the standard fertilizer package.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The practice of scientific development of potatoes is very good for optimising for things that you would not necessarily find in the wild. Essentially it's the output of a bunch of potato <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">nerds</a> and we can always learn interesting things from nerds we wouldn't otherwise have encountered. But when we take the nice, idealised, potato and bring it into the real world, we find out all sorts of ways it doesn't fit, or where it's a bit precious, and we learn to adapt it as such.</p>


<p>I wrote before in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-10-08:54.html">How to be a better person</a> that we need a practice of ethics more than a theory of ethics, but the theory of ethics stuff is good too, we just may need to heavily adapt it as we bring it into the real world of practical decision making. Possibly by substituting dung instead of its standard fertilizer package.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Popular Culture Reference, David</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-04</dd>
</dl>


<p>(A quick post today, due to needing to get on with other things very shortly)</p>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2yzEkGq">How to talk about books you haven't read</a> by Pierre Bayard, page 61:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The most common literary confrontations are those that occur in our social lives, and of these the most vexing are those in which we are expected to express ourselves in front of a group. On such occasions, the conversation may turn to a book we have not read. If the book in question is assumed to be known by all cultivated individuals [...]</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The thing that struck me about this is how much it doesn't happen to me. I don't think I have ever had a conversation in which someone is surprised that I haven't read a particular book, except very occasionally as a joke because they assume I've read everything. I can't think of any examples of books that have that level of cultural penetration among people I know.</p>


<p>Most of this is probably a difference between me and Pierre Bayard - he's coming from a French literary scene. His friends' notion of "all cultivated individuals" probably doesn't include me or my friends.</p>


<p>He's also quite a lot older than me, and my suspicion is that he's describing an event that is genuinely less common these days, because instead our shared cultural objects seem mostly to be TV shows and movies.
And there I get that a lot. It's a running joke: "Popular culture reference, David, you wouldn't understand."</p>


<p>This is not, I hasten to add, because I'm too classy for TV and movies. Movies don't really work well for me as a format, but I do watch a lot of TV, most of it not very good. I just skip out on a lot of mainstream stuff because it doesn't work well for me (for example I cannot stand embarassment based humour and have no interest in watching things that make me whole body cringe).</p>


<p>I'm generally OK just saying that I haven't watched it. This does, often, result in a bunch of pressure to watch things. "You absolutely must watch it! It's amazing!" is somehow perfectly socially acceptable, despite a single season of a TV show probably being at least twelve hours of watching, but people get edgy and defensive when I recommend books to them.</p>


<p>I understand why this is. It's easy to find twelve hours to watch TV, it's hard to find five hours to read a book, because the latter requires focus and causes people to confront all sorts of unpleasant emotions about their relationship with reading, while the former allows them to palliate by fast-forwarding their brain through those twelve hours.</p>


<p>(There's nothing wrong with doing that if that's what you want to do, but I think people are kidding themselves about this)</p>


<p>I think in some ways TV shows also just work better as a shared cultural object than books, because there are so many fewer of them. It's very expensive to produce a TV show. It's not cheap to produce a book, but it's cheap enough that there are several orders of magnitude more books than TV shows. Even best sellers rarely have the penetration of a moderately popular TV show (with a few outliers like Harry Potter).</p>


<p>Unfortunately creating sharedness of our cultural objects by making them expensive to produce isn't so great. It creates a very high barrier to entry on whose voices become part of our shared culture, and it creates an incentive to make it accessible to as broad an audience as possible. It prioritises relatable over insightful.</p>


<p>That's not to say that TV shows are necessarily <em>bad</em> shared cultural objects. There are some very good ones. I'm genuinely very grateful to The Good Place for existing. Trigonometry (which I still need to finish watching) is some great representation.</p>


<p>I'm not going to say Stargate is a <em>good</em> shared cultural object (or, frankly, a particularly shared one - it's not unpopular by any means given how long it ran for, but it's not something I can reasonably <em>expect</em> people to have watched), but I still like it and will enjoy talking Stargate with people.</p>


<p>But it does leave a popular culture that is strangely anemic. Fandom fills in the gaps, fleshing out the world of shared culture with the voices it lacks. Fandom is its own popular culture, building a richer world on top of the shared cultural objects provided to us. It is, however, a relatively niche thing that most people don't seem aware of or participate in - I'm only on the outskirts of it myself, and I don't really know how I would go about participating more deeply (or whether I want to).</p>


<p>I don't really have any closing thoughts, except that it'd actually be quite nice to have a group where there was a shared canon of books that actually I <em>could</em> assume everyone in that group had read.</p>
