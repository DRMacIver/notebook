<p class="subtitle">Feet as a Foundational Skill</p>

<p>"Fix a man's feet, and you will make him comfortable for a month. Teach a man to walk properly, and you will make him comfortable for life. Therefore denying people access to good foot education is key to monthly recurring revenue." - Ancient Capitalist Proverb.</p>


<p>I'm currently working on being good at feet.</p>


<p>Being bad at feet sounds ridiculous, right? Almost as ridiculous as <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-11-09:32.html">being bad at breathing</a>. I am bad at both feet and breathing, and I'd wager that many of you reading this are too.</p>


<p>One of the reasons you can tell that I am bad at feet is that I've spent the last 10-15 years in semiconstant pain. Not, you know, a <em>lot</em> of pain. Just a dull ache in most of the joints of my right leg that waxes and wanes but never really goes away. I've always been a bit reluctant to identify as someone who experiences chronic pain - it doesn't really match the definition of chronic pain, you know, other than being pain and being chronic - other people have it much worse than me (this is a bullshit line of thinking and I know it's a bullshit line of thinking. I have now more or less <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">reconciled the alief</a> and recognised that, but it took a while).</p>


<p>Another way in which I am bad at feet is that standing for long periods of time is painful. Walking is generally fine, but if I stand for more than about half an hour my legs will be very sad and probably hate me the next day.</p>


<p>I've at various points tried to get medical professionals to take these problems seriously, but it's never worked very well. The best I got is about a year and a half ago I got custom insoles made. They... maybe helped a bit? Not much.</p>


<p>But now, in one of the rare upsides of the world going to hell, my chronic pain is at the lowest it's been since my early 20s - it's not gone, but it's mostly retreated to a vague twinge in my hip (which is where all this started).
I attribute this largely to the almost total lack of wearing shoes, especially as it's accelerated since I've switched to barefoot shoes for running.</p>


<p>Standing for long periods of time is still a bit tricky, so I'm working on arch strength. I've switched to working standing in twenty minute stints recently, and doing a bunch of exercises for strengthening my arches, added a nightly (self) foot massage to my care routine, and I'm looking into toe straightening (one of the structural failings of my feet is that my outer toes curl inwards. I'm pretty sure this is related, because combining arch exercises with toe straightening is excruciating). These might or might not work, but I'm hopeful.</p>


<p>Anyway, this isn't really a post about feet. This is a post about being bad at things.</p>


<p>At no point in the more than a decade that I've been dealing with this problem did I consider that the root issue of my chronic pain might be that I was using my feet wrong. I knew that the problem with standing was related to flat feet, but I thought of that as an intrinsic structural issue rather than something that I could work on by changing how I use my feet. At no point did it occur to me that feet were a foundational skill that I could just work on getting better at and that this would significantly improve my life.</p>


<p>How much would it improve my life? Hard to say. Not being in constant pain is a pretty good improvement to start with but consider also...</p>


<ul>
<li>I am bad at sleep. Some of that is due to the aforementioned being bad at breathing, but some of it is due to the fact that being in pain makes it hard to sleep!</li>
<li>I am bad at socialising in groups, especially parties. How much of that is because group social situations tend to involve a lot of standing, so I tend to be tired and in pain for a lot of them, which gives me fewer opportunities to get good at groups and also gives me negative associations with them?</li>
</ul>


<p>(As an aside, being bad at standing is something I've mentioned before as an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-23-09:37.html">illegible marginalisation</a>)</p>


<p>I'm not saying that these are the only causes, because <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-11:43.html">very little is monocausal</a>. I'm saying that among the weird and varied landscapes of life, these have exerted consistent pressure in some fairly negative directions.</p>


<p>I suspect there are a lot of foundational skills like this, and we currently don't have any infrastructure for identifying them, or learning to be better at them.</p>


<p>This is particularly problematic because being bad at these foundational skills is something you can kinda get away with early on - you have more energy to power through them, and have not been subjected to the constant low-grade degradation of your body (or mind! Much of the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">emotions as legacy code</a> model plays out this way too) that being bad at these skills causes, so by the time you start to notice the effects you're at the point where you feel like you should have life sorted out and you just treat these as the inevitable consequences of aging, when really they're a sign that you need to relearn a foundational skill.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Feeling Good About Being Good</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-22</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm currently working through a (more or less) full reread of <a href="https://amzn.to/3g53ayI">Voices: The Educational Formation of Conscience</a>, so you're going to get treated to a lot of extracts from it. Today's extract comes from page 41:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[...] normation just <em>is</em> this structuring of the emotions of self-assessment -shame, guilt, embarassment, pride, and the like-both in our self-assessment and in our judgements of others. It follows, of course, that it structures also the positive emotions companion to these that I have called the emotions of self-assessment. That is to say normation structures also the appearance of elation, pride, self-assurance, and the joy and hope that accompany these. By saying that normation structures these emotions, I mean to refer not to the logic of their composition, whether they presuppose some propositional content, as in one or another version of a cognitive theory of the emotions. I mean to refer rather to their focus or object. Normation gives content to these emotions inasmuch as it provides their object. It tells us <em>what</em> things are going to provoke such emotions. In short, normation makes these emotions specific. Structuring them in this way is precisely what mere compliance is powerless to accomplish. Again, absent these emotions and the norms themselves will vanish. Observance will deconstruct into mere compliance, governance into mere behavior.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This continues to explore the theme of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-20-09:54.html">the connection between morality and emotional health that I highlighted before</a>.</p>


<p>To unpack what Green is saying in this:</p>


<ul>
<li>Normation is the social process by which we acquire norms of behaviour - voices of conscience with which we reflexively judge whether behaviour is good or bad.</li>
<li>"Observance" of a norm is distinguished from mere "compliance" when we feel the force of the norm internally rather than merely adhering to the behaviour it prescribes. e.g. we are observant to a norm of honesty if we feel guilty about lying, but we may still be honest (compliant with the norm of honesty) without internalising that norm if we think that honesty is the best policy for purely practical reasons.</li>
</ul>


<p>So the general point of the quote is that this process of internalising moral norms is about structuring how we <em>feel</em> about action: When we do something we feel is morally good, we feel good, when we do something we feel is morally bad, we feel bad. Observance to moral norms is defined by part of the structure of our emotional responses.</p>


<p>One of the interesting things to me about this passage is its emphasis on both the negative <em>and</em> positive emotional responses to observing a norms (it also amuses me that he lists "pride" under both). I don't know about you, but I think of morality as primarily experienced through negative emotions - especially guilt and shame - but there are of course positive emotions associated with it.</p>


<p>Part of why I've been interested in <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/">Virtue Ethics</a> recently is that it feels that this is the only one of the currently extant ethical frameworks that get this right (and, interestingly, although Green doesn't make this explicit, his voices of conscience sure sound a lot like virtues to me). If you are striving for excellence, there is a sort of joy in that. If morality is nothing more than a series of duties, or a number you are seeking to make constantly go up, then morality is purely a burden, a stick to beat ourselves with.</p>


<p>I previously wrote about the use of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html">fine-grained ethical distinctions</a> - in particularly the distinction between it being virtuous to do something and being a duty to do something - and I think these track pretty well with emotional reactions. If you fail in your moral duties, it's proper to feel guilty over that. If you have a pattern of failing in your moral duties, it's proper to feel shame over that. But if you exemplify your moral virtues, it's also proper to feel joy in that.</p>


<p>This brings the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a> / <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a> model into the question of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-10-08:54.html">how to be a better person</a> - if we can take joy in our moral successes, then we will want to be better people, and this will drive us to become such.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Against the Classification of Books</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-21</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ylGMjz">How to Read a Book</a>, p 64:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>We have already discussed a rough classification of books. The main distinction, we said, was between works of fiction, on the one hand, and works conveying knowledge, or expository works, on the other hand. Among expository works, we can further distinguish history from philosophy, and both from science and mathematics.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is part of a general section about how analytical reading should start with the question "What sort of book is this?"</p>


<p>On page 60, they list this as the first rule of analytical reading:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>You must know what kind of book you are reading, and you should know this as early in the process as possible, preferably before you begin to read.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The authors do not, frankly, justify this very well. At the end of this chapter their argument is this:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Now, just as there is a difference in the art of teaching in different fields, so there is a reciprocal difference in the art of being taught. The activity of the student must somehow be responsive to the activity of the instructor. The relation between books and their readers is the same as that between teachers and their students. Hence, as books differ in the kinds of knowledge they have to communicate, they proceed to instruct us differently; and, if we are to follow them, we must learn to read each kind in an appropriate manner.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>To which I offer the following responses:</p>


<ol>
<li>A book is not a person, and our relationship is <em>very</em> different to that of a person.</li>
<li>The argument is nonsense for people too.</li>
</ol>


<p>You can engage with a book however you like. There's no moral obligation to engage with a book as the authors want you to - if you want to read a book of science through a literary criticism lens, or a book of literary criticism through a scientific lens, you can.</p>


<p>Even the practical vs theoretical distinction is dubious: I read a lot of philosophy. This philosophy is, for the most part, eminently theoretical, but I am reading it for practical reasons, to help me make sense of things. This requires me to do a lot of translation by doing the active work of framing practical situations using the tools provided.
This is not a style of engagement that a philosopher would generally be receptive to (it depends on the philosopher of course) and they would probably find it quite frustrating. A book can't be frustrated with me, so I'm free to use it however I like.</p>


<p>It's certainly true that treating a science book as a science book and a piece of literature as a piece of literature will result in results that are more... in line with the intent of the author I guess, and you should probably do that more often than not - it's useful to learn the norms before you violate them - but they don't necessarily produce more <em>interesting</em> outcomes, and different reads will tend to help you
<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html">bridge the gaps between different areas of knowledge</a>.</p>


<p>The second problem is that the idea that coarse grained classifications are anything like enough. People have very individual styles and, yes, those are rooted in their communities of practice, but those communities of practice are only loosely defined by disciplines - they're often very different between subdisciplines, departments, individual teacher / student lineages, etc. You need to do at least as much work to identify those individual differences in engagement as you do to identify the genre.</p>


<p>Instead of asking "What sort of book is this?" I think the questions you should be asking are:</p>


<ol>
<li>Can I engage with this book in a way that I want to?</li>
<li>If not, where can I learn the skills for doing so?</li>
</ol>


<p>Knowing what sort of book it is <em>can</em> be helpful for answering the question, but often it is going to be much more about your relationship to the subject matter than it is about the type of book per se.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How I fix anxiety triggers</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-20</dd>
</dl>


<p>This is a sketch of the skillset I use to deal with anxiety. It works well when:</p>


<ol>
<li>Anxiety is at a level that I can deal with.</li>
<li>It is anxiety <em>about</em> something.</li>
<li>You are me.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example:</p>


<ul>
<li>I currently feel vaguely anxious. Not sure what about. It's not especially hard to deal with, I'm just noticing a certain tension in my shoulders and that I feel slightly on edge. This is undirected anxiety, and I don't currently have a good skillset for dealing with it.</li>
<li>I'm currently putting off a whole bunch of accounting stuff because accounting stuff makes me super anxious and I don't <em>want</em> to deal with it. I should do this, but I haven't, and forcing myself into doing it is probably not helpful for dealing with my anxiety on the subject.</li>
<li>You might not be me, and have different sets of problems as a result. I'm reasonably confident that something in this space works for fairly general reasons, but I can't promise that doing exactly what I do will work for you.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Basic Procedure</h3>


<p>The procedure is very simple:</p>


<ol>
<li>Notice that a thing is triggering anxiety.</li>
<li>Figure out <em>why</em> it's triggering anxiety.</li>
<li>Ask if the current situation is actually one I need to be anxious about.<ul>
<li>If yes, keep being anxious, taking appropriate steps to increase your safety.</li>
<li>If no, stop being anxious, and also be less anxious in similar situations in future.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<p>All three of these are very simple but they are not easy and require developing some foundational skills that I'll talk about at the end.</p>


<p>Does it work? In my experience, pretty reliably, as long as you can actually work through the procedure (which can be both intellectually and emotionally difficult).</p>


<h3>Why does this work?</h3>


<p>The basic philosophical premises of this are:</p>


<ol>
<li>Anxiety is not in and of itself bad. Anxiety is your reaction to being in a dangerous situation, making you aware of it so that you can be prepared. It is good to be aware of when you are in a dangerous situation.</li>
<li>Your brain does not do a perfectly rational threat assessment of the situation, it learns simple pattern matching rules.</li>
<li>When a rule is active you can change it by better understanding the situation and gently guiding yourself towards understanding why it doesn't apply.</li>
</ol>


<p>(3) is the basic idea behind <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/book-summary-unlocking-the-emotional-brain">coherence therapy</a>: You can retrain emotions when they are triggered.</p>


<p>I've previously explained the idea that your bundle of emotional reactions are a messy complex system that you can debug and refactor in the previous three posts:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">Emotional reactions as legacy code</a></li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-03-09:07.html">Your emotions are valid but probably wrong</a></li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">Alief/Belief Coherence</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>What doesn't work</h3>


<p>The main thing that people try to do with anxiety is suppress it. This doesn't work, and probably makes your anxiety worse, for several reasons:</p>


<ul>
<li>It causes you to ignore anxiety in unsafe situations where it's actually worth being anxious.</li>
<li>If you can only fix reactions when they're active, if you succeed at suppressing a reaction it'll just come back later.</li>
<li>Emotions tend to rise to the level that is required to get us to do something about them, so this will tend to make anxiety worse.</li>
</ul>


<p>Unfortunately because we've got into the habit of treating anxiety itself as the problem, this is the natural thing to do. My instinct is that you are better off palliating to deal with the anxious situation or avoiding it entirely rather than trying to suppress it.</p>


<h3>Foundational Skills</h3>


<p>Although the procedure is simple, it requires some relatively difficult foundational skills:</p>


<ul>
<li>Self-compassion, the ability to talk compassionately and without judgement.</li>
<li>Focusing, the ability to use felt sense and verbalisation to understand your own feelings.</li>
<li>Discomfort tolerance, the ability to remain uncomfortable without treating it as an emergency.</li>
<li>Noticing triggers, the ability to explicitly notice and identify triggered states.</li>
</ul>


<p>I talked about some of these in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/01/a-crash-course-in-having-feelings/">A Crash Course in Having Feelings</a>. I don't necessarily have good advice beyond that post on how to develop these skills, but some books that I found helpful in learning about each of these are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Self-compassion: <a href="https://amzn.to/3g52wRL">Rewriting the Rules</a> by Meg-John Barker</li>
<li>Focusing: <a href="https://amzn.to/3cPJEnN">Focusing</a> by Eugene Gendlin</li>
<li>Discomfort Tolerance: <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZlZ2EB">Conflict is not Abuse</a></li>
<li>Noticing triggers: <a href="https://amzn.to/36ghhg9">Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving</a> (I'd probably recommend starting with <a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/trauma-and-cptsd-101/">Meg-John Barker's Post on this</a></li>
</ul>


<p>But to be honest I think with all of these the real way to get good at them is just to practice. Of these I'd most strongly recommend "A Crash Course in Having Feelings", "Focusing", and MJB's post on trauma. The others were important to my development, but I read a lot of books so that's relatively cheap for me, and was only really a way to get started. The best thing for actually developing these skills was to use them in practice.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Morality and Emotion</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-20</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3g53ayI">Voices: The Educational Formation of Conscience</a>, page 18:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"What is my duty?" is made, by many accounts, the entry question into philosophical ethics. For a philosophy of moral education, however, entry is gained more fully through the Socratic question, "How ought one to live?"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The distinction that Green is drawing in this book is between philosophy of ethics, which develops ethical theories of what it is like to behave ethically, and philosophy of moral education, which asks how people learn to behave ethically.</p>


<p>This is intimately tied to my point in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-10-08:54.html">How to become a better person</a> that as well as a <em>theory</em> of ethics we need a <em>practice</em> of ethics.
A philosophy of moral education is not necessarily that practice, but it is at least less far removed from it:
If you ask "What is my duty?", an answer can assume that part of your duty is that you are responsible for figuring out how to uphold your other duties. If you ask "How should I live?", you might quite reasonably object if the answer is a little light on practical details about how, exactly, you are supposed to be able to live in the manner described.</p>


<p>There's something about the question "How ought one to live?" that feels hopelessly naive and/or oppressive these days. Who are you to tell me what to do?</p>


<p>The <em>ought</em> in particular feels dangerous. It feels like a question that can only be asked in the presence of a certain amount of coercive power - as if whatever answer you give to the question, that's the answer you're going to impose on others.</p>


<p>On top of that, there can be no single <em>ought</em>, because are all different people with different desires and constraints. The idea of a one sized fits all "best life" seems both impossible and undesirable.</p>


<p>And yet, I still think there's something there. Perhaps not "How ought one to live?" but "How can one figure out how to live?" or "What tools are there to figure out how to live?" or "How can we help people live their best lives?".</p>


<p>I think we underestimate the interplay between morality and emotional health. Many of our strongest emotions and feelings have a moral component. Guilt and shame, certainly, but also love and empathy. Emotions and morality interplay strongly as we act in the world, especially with regards to other people.</p>


<p>I suggested in "How to be a better person" that improving your emotional skills would probably automatically make you a better person, but I think the converse might be true too: Becoming a better person will improve your emotional health (as long as it's paired with good skills for working with emotions - I still think those are the foundations).</p>


<p>Part of this is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-16-12:06.html">acedia</a>. I think one of the causes of acedia is living out of line with our values - sometimes because our values are bad, sometimes because we are forced to, and sometimes because it is easier to ignore that dissonance than deal with them. We learn not to care as a defence mechanism, and bringing ourselves more in line with our values allows us to repair some of that.</p>


<p>Another part is the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a> / <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a> model. Emotional skills are what provide you with safety to become better, but others are often the spur for that. Certainly much of my current growth came from having people who I wanted to be better for.</p>


<p>In my first read of Green <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">I was pretty negative about some of this themes</a>. I still think that's right - a great deal of his work is about how we adopt a community's norms, and my experience is that most communities' norms are very unsafe to internalise. My current read is more sympathetic: I still think moral norms are dangerous tools that are often misused, but I think they also might be a key part of finding our way to better lives as long as we can find the right people to develop them with.</p>
