<p class="subtitle">78 Thinking Hats</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-26</dd>
</dl>


<p>This post is breaking the trend and is <em>not</em> based on a random passage from a book, so is a bonus post for today, though it will contain multiple references to books.</p>


<p>In "<a href="https://amzn.to/2VCBSYa">Six Thinking Hats</a>" Edward de Bono talks about the idea of there being six "directions" that you can pull thought in, each of which is best characterised by a coloured hat. Because he's de Bono, and thus a self-important asshole, the book opens as follows:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The Six Thinking Hats method may well be the most important change in human thinking for the past twenty-three hundred years.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Uh huh.</p>


<p>He goes on to say:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>That may seem a rather exaggerated claim but the evidence is beginning to point that way.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>No it isn't, shut up.</p>


<p>Despite my intense dislike for de Bono as a human being, the book isn't bad, and has some moderately useful ideas in it, and each of the different directions of thought <em>is</em> one that is useful to push your thinking in.</p>


<p>To quote his description of the hats (page 13):</p>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>White Hat</strong> White is neutral and objective. The white hat is concerned with objective facts and figures.</p>
<p><strong>Red Hat</strong> Red suggests anger (seeing red), rage and emotions. The red hat gives the emotional view.</p>
<p><strong>Black Hat</strong> Black is sombre and serious. The black hat is cautious and careful. It points out the weaknesses in an idea.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Hat</strong> Yellow is sunny and positive. The yellow hat is optimistic and covers hope and positive thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Green Hat</strong> Green is grass, vegetation and abundant, fertile growth. The green hat indicates creativity and new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Blue Hat</strong> Blue is cool, and it is also the colour of the sky, which is above everything else. The blue hat is concerned with control, the organization of the thinking process and the use of other hats.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The hats pair as White and Red, Black and Yellow, Green and Blue, each defining an opposite direction.
The idea is that people adopt a hat at a time, with the hats giving them <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html">permission</a> to pull their thinking further in that direction than they otherwise would.</p>


<p>Do de Bono's ideas work? Yeah, I think they do. Certainly I've got some good use out of some of his ideas from another of his books, "<a href="https://amzn.to/355DAVj">Lateral Thinking</a>", but I think his ideas work for a very simple reason: It's <em>really</em> hard to come up with things that don't work.
The main thing de Bono's ideas having going for them is that de Bono is very good at marketing his ideas in a way that only causes <em>most</em> people to dismiss them instead of everyone.</p>


<p>His books are short and kinda interesting, so I don't recommend against reading them and might read a few more in future, but I think most of the value they bring comes from the fact that not enough people are doing this sort of thing because it would be <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html">too weird</a>,
and if you want to use de Bono's work for groups you're better off looking at something like <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">liberating structures</a>.</p>


<p>Basically, I think that almost <em>anything</em> you can do that pulls your thinking in a direction that it doesn't naturally gravitate will prove interesting. We've been seeing that with the recent use of random readings from books to prompt posts - I'm still finding my feet on that a bit, but I think it's been very positive and it's certainly caused me to write things I would not otherwise be writing.</p>


<p>Which ties in to something I've been thinking about for years but have never really got around to doing, which is Tarot reading.</p>


<p>Tarot obviously doesn't let you foresee the future, except insofar as you can already foresee the future because brains are causal reasoning machines that are fairly good at predicting the future on their own. Instead, tarot cards are a tool for randomised prompts for narrative construction, but having those randomised prompts causes you to construct narratives or think about things in ways that you wouldn't necessarily otherwise do.</p>


<p>Learning Tarot "properly" is something I keep putting off, so given the success of the randomised prompts from books, I thought it might be worth integrating some of it into my writing practice.
How exactly this plays out will be something to experiment with, but if nothing else it will drive familiarity with the cards.</p>


<p>For convenient linkability I'll use the cards descriptions from <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/">www.learntarot.com</a> (the author of that site also has <a href="https://amzn.to/3aD3zo7">a book that I'll be consulting</a>).</p>


<p>Today I drew a pair of cards:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj02.htm">The High Priestess</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/p2.htm">The Two of Pentacles</a></li>
</ul>


<p>A core theme of the high priestess is intuition and mystery, paying attention to the subconscious. Actions listed include "Using your intuition" and "Seeking guidance from within". She is described as "the guardian of the unconscious".</p>


<p>The two of pentacles is, among other things, about fun and flexibility. Actions include "going with the flow" and "doing something you enjoy". The two of pentancles is described as "There is nothing quite like the feeling of being graceful and effective at the same time."</p>


<p>This puts me in mind of Focusing and Alexander Technique, two things which are fairly central to my current pursuit of emotional awareness and embodiment work. Focusing is using your bodily sense to learn about your emotional state, while this sort of graceful and effective movement is a key feature of Alexander Technique.</p>


<p>The other thing that is interesting in this link is the idea of "having fun". How do you know when you're having fun? This isn't a rhetorical question. What does "fun" feel like? </p>


<p>I don't know either to be honest. I'm not very good at fun. I can do interest, I can do spontaneity, I can enjoy things, but <em>fun</em> is weird for me. I'm hoping Focusing will help me unpack that a bit, by paying more attention to the phenomenological character of enjoyment and leaning into it a bit (and yes, I am aware that the fact that "How do I have fun? Let's learn more phenomenology!" is very much part of the problem. I am <em>not good</em> at either of these cards, which is part of why they are interesting).</p>


<p>I suspect that fun is only visible to you after the fact. If you're too self-conscious about the fact that you're having fun, you'll forget to have fun. Overthinking is a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html">brake</a> on your ability to have fun.</p>


<p>This is part of why the two of pentacles puts me in mind of Alexander Technique. If fun is primarily an embodied state, then <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html">the half of you that is embodied</a> is much more able to have fun than your cognitive half. Peter Nobes (my Alexander Technique) teacher relates a story of a standup comic: "Are there any intellectuals in the room? Raise your hand." (nobody raises their hand) "Good. Intellectuals don't know how to laugh. They just sit there and stroke their chin and go ah yes I see that's very funny". Highly relatable.</p>


<p>One of the ways I have been deploying both sides of this recently - Focusing and Alexander Technique - is to try to have more fun doing exercise. Doing exercise not because I think I <em>should</em> exercise, but because my body invites me to do so and to enjoy it. Using exercise as a way to engage with my embodied self, and to drop into a flow state. So far it hasn't resulted in a massive amount of exercise, but I've done some most days, and the amount I am doing seems to be going up over time rather than down, and at no point have I done any exercise and resented it.
This is pretty amazing, and makes me think there might be something to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html">this human notion of "fun"</a> you people are always going on about.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Fixed and growth relationships</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-26</dd>
</dl>


<p>Today the successor group to our Rewriting the Rules reading group is meeting, and we're talking about daily habits we've tried to implement over the last couple of weeks. My habit has been rereading - dropping into books I've already read and reading at least one page from them (usually more, but the success criterion is one page). That habit lead more or less directly to the current "Today's reading" style of notebook posts, so I thought I would honour it with an appropriate choice of book today.</p>


<p>From "<a href="https://amzn.to/3eQhfQ3">Rewriting the Rules</a>", Page 207:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Actually, fixing or objectifying yourself is extremely common. It comes back to the sense that we're lacking, which we explored in Chapter 2. Much of the power of falling in love comes from the fact we find ourselves fixed in the gaze of another person in a wonderful way. This person dancing opposite me in a nightclub, sitting across from me over a candlelit dinner, or lying next to me in bed, gazes at me in adoration. The vision of myself that I see reflected in their eyes is a person I'd dearly love to be. It's like they see all the good stuff and none of the bad. As long as they look at me like that perhaps I can pretend there <em>isn't</em> any bad in me. Maybe they're right and I really <em>am</em> that loveable through and through. No wonder love can feel like a drug we can't get enough of.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In context "fixed" is meant to mean "set" or "frozen", not the opposite of broken. MJB is talking about the tendency to want to see ourselves as singular, well-defined, identities rather than, to use their term, plural and in progress. This is in a chapter about conflict, and follows on from talking about how Sartre considers us to be unavoidably in conflict with each other.</p>


<p>Things that immediately come to mind in response to this:</p>


<ul>
<li>Naturally, thinking about conflict makes me think of Thomas Schelling's book about nuclear war, <a href="https://amzn.to/3bGnLXp">The Strategy of Conflict</a> where he defines conflicts as positive-sum games with imperfectly aligned incentives. This is a perfect way of looking at relationships, romantic and otherwise.</li>
<li>Thinking about relationship problems inevitably makes me think of my own post <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html">Trust beyond reason</a>, because it has become my explain-everything theory for relationship problems: Relationship problems exist because you do not trust someone at a level that is needed for their importance to you to be safe.</li>
<li>Relationships as fixing you contrasts interestingly with bell hooks's notion of love as growth that I mentioned in my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-25-10:40.html">last post</a>, putting me in mind of a relationship version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_and_Growth_Mindset">fixed vs growth mindset</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>I have roughly two experiences of romantic love. In one, it was definitely quite in line with this idea of fixing each other into ideal versions of our selves. In the other (the current one), it is much more in line with bell hooks's notion of love as growth. The latter is much better, let me tell you.</p>


<p>Sartre is correct, people are unavoidably in conflict, at least in the Schelling sense: Our relationships are positive sum games, in which our incentives are perfectly aligned. What we want out from the other is not exactly the same as what the other wants for themself. That doesn't necessarily mean that we would ever want to force them to do what we want instead of what they want, it just means that we have preferences and feelings about what they do that are somewhat separated from their own.</p>


<p>In and of itself there is nothing wrong with this, but one thing that I think goes wrong is that we are terrified of our partners rejecting us, and we fear that going against their preferences will cause them to do so. We may not believe this, but we certainly <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">alieve</a> it.</p>


<p>One strategy for conflict is to credibly threaten to punish the other party for going against your interests. Even if the punishment is costly, this can be worth doing. Mutually Assured Destruction is an example of this - once you know the other side has launched nuclear weapons at you, there is literally no benefit to you launching nuclear weapons back. It's a purely vindictive act that will not save you but will destroy them. However, the fact that you were able to credibly commit to doing this makes it very unlikely (unless they fuck up, which is always the concern) that they will ever launch those nuclear missiles in the first place. By making the threat you have changed the pay off matrix, so that the option where they launch nuclear missiles at you is no longer high payoff for them (because it results in their obliteration as well).</p>


<p>In this analogy, the fear of rejection is the nuclear threat.
While rejection is not quite as bad as having your country obliterated and millions of lives lost to atomic fire, from the inside it can be hard to remember that, especially if you're <a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/trauma-and-cptsd-101/">traumatised</a> by a history of being treated badly (whether by family, peers, or in relationships).</p>


<p>You may argue that one should note be adopting manipulative tactics in a relationship (you certainly shouldn't be <em>threatening</em> your partner!), and you would be right, but unfortunately it's not that simple: Generally speaking tactics we adopt are not the result of deliberate forethought, they are the result of our behaviours being shaped over time in response to feedback and incentives. Many of our behaviours are <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">legacy code</a>, and many more of them are <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">contingent cultural effects</a> that we have learned in response to each other in a given context.</p>


<p>The nice thing about mutually assured destruction is that, generally speaking, nobody dies in atomic fire. That's good. It is strictly better than people dying in atomic fire. Good outcome.</p>


<p>The <em>less</em> nice thing about mutually assured destruction is that <em>everybody is constantly stressed out about the possibility of dying in atomic fire</em>. This is still vastly better than dying, but is quite a lot worse than not being stressed out about dying.</p>


<p>The same is true in relationships. Not being rejected is good, but being constantly afraid of being rejected as a way to achieve that is bad. This fear of rejection is a major part of what causes us to fix ourselves into a version seen by our partner: We try to fix ourselves as the version that will not be rejected.</p>


<p>bell hooks defines love as "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of one's own or another's spiritual growth". But growth <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">requires safety</a> - if you are living in fear of rejection, you will not feel safe, and you will not be able to grow.</p>


<p>This means love in hooks sense requires us to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-06-15:20.html">be safe for others</a> who we are to be in a relationship with. If your partner is to express themselves honestly, it needs to be safe for them to do so. This means you need to:</p>


<ol>
<li>Not react with judgement or blame when they tell you how they're feeling.</li>
<li><em>Also</em> not automatically change your behaviour to accommodate everything that they're feeling.</li>
</ol>


<p>The first is a form of rejection, and is exactly what people are afraid of. The second is often an overreaction and, because your partner loves you, may cause them to avoid telling you things for fear of causing you harm.
After all, if you know that someone you love will react as if they're a terrible person because they caused you some mild discomfort, are you going to share that discomfort with them?</p>


<p>Once you have this safety, it becomes possible to build trust to a much greater degree, because you know that that trust building will not be met with rejection. This is the extending of one's self that bell hooks is talking about: You are putting yourself into the relationship, in a way that allows the other to know you, and gives them <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html">permission</a> to be known by you in turn.</p>


<p>This also allows you to know yourself in a way that is almost impossible to achieve on your own.
Self-awareness allows us to know many things about our selves that are not visible to others,
and that this fear of extending ourselves into the world causes us to deliberately hide from them,
but we discount how many things about ourselves that we have no idea about are visible to others.</p>


<p>In "<a href="https://amzn.to/3cOWfXU">Mindfulness in 3D</a>" Peter Nobes talks about <em>Faulty Sensory Appreciation</em> - the idea that our image of our self, especially of our posture, is often completely wrong in ways that are really obvious to others. He goes into this less in the book, but talking to Peter makes it clear how broadly he thinks it applies, and I agree. Often our moods are more obvious to those around us than they are to ourselves. Certainly how we come across to others is often invisible to us, and is often reflective of underlying learned reactions that we are not consciously aware of.</p>


<p>When our reactions in a relationship are safe, it becomes possible not only for our partners to tell us about their selves, but also for them to tell us about ourselves, and through this reciprocated love we can grow together.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The conditional love of a small town</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-25</dd>
</dl>


<p>From bell hooks's "<a href="https://amzn.to/2W0Q9gk">All About Love</a>", Page 100:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I like living in small towns precisely because they are most often the places in our nation where basic principles underlying a love ethic exist and are the standards by which most people try to live their lives. In the small town where I live (now only some of the time) there is a spirit of neighborliness [...] We protect and nurture our collective well-being. We try to make our home place a positive environment for everyone. We all agree that integrity and care enhance all our lives. We try to live by the principles of a love ethic.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Earlier in the book she defines love based on the work of Erich Fromm as "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of one's own or another's spiritual growth", which is a definition I quite like (with perhaps mild quibbles about the word "spiritual"), although given how into personal growth I am (it's practically a love language), I would.</p>


<p>So a community that lives by a love ethic is one where everyone is committed to contributing to each other's personal growth.
Such a community is <em>incredibly</em> appealing to me, and I often fantasize about finding or creating it.</p>


<p>Also, the idea of finding such a community in a small town? Not just no, but hell no.</p>


<p>One thing I think this illustrates is how non-transferable experiences of marginalisation are.
bell hooks obviously has more experience of marginalisation than I do - she is a black woman in the US, while I am in most regards a fairly privileged white man. But I am also a queer neurodivergent person, and the experience of small towns for people like me is literally the worst.</p>


<p>If you're sufficiently "weird" and live or go to school in a small town, chances are pretty good you know almost nobody like you, and it's awful.
In a large city you may still struggle to find people like you, but those people are at least there and once you've found a few you will find more through them. It is possible to build a community of people like you, and to build a love ethic within that community, in a way that I don't think people like me are ever going to really find in a small town.</p>


<p>I've been reading James C. Scott's "<a href="https://amzn.to/2Kzllyc">The Art of Not Being Governed</a>" recently (a book I suspect has never previously been linked to bell hooks's "All About Love"), which is about the hill people of Zomia, a large region of South East Asia, and their relationship to the states. In particular it points out that that rather than being some sort of "living ancestors" of the people of the valley states, the hill people are typically the descendants of refugees who fled the state.</p>


<p>One of the things that this has been making me think about is the use of marginalisation as an enabling technology. Many schemes for organising humanity along legible lines work much better if you can just get the people who don't fit to leave. Otherwise you'd have to force them to conform to the system (hard, probably causes rebellions), kill them (same. Also ethics I guess), or adapt the system in order to accommodate the actual richness of human experience (yeah right).</p>


<p>In the case of Zomia this is a flight from the large to the small - from the big states to the small isolated communities of the hills - but when it comes to towns there's an equal flight from the small to the large. The people who are weird and don't fit in nope out of the small towns and go find somewhere where they're less constrained. Small communities enforce their own sort of legibility on the people within them, and those who are illegible to them flee to the cities.</p>


<p>It may well be that small towns do exhibit the sort of love aesthetic that bell hooks describes, where everyone living in them promotes each other's spiritual growth, but if so they do so by driving out everyone who tries to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html">grow in ways that are not approved</a>.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Democracy isn't just voting</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-24</dd>
</dl>


<p>This post's reading comes from Amartya Sen's "<a href="https://amzn.to/2XYL8aP">Identity and Violence</a>", page 55, although actually it mostly comes from Nelson Mandela's "Long Walk to Freedom" (which I haven't read).</p>


<blockquote>
<p>In his autobiography <em>Long Walk to Freedom</em>, Nelson Mandela describes how influenced he was, as a young boy, by seeing the democratic nature of the proceedings of the local meetings in his African hometown.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone who wanted to speak did so. It was democracy in its purest form. There may have been a hierarchy of importance among the speakers, but everyone was heard, chief and subject, warrior and medicine man, shopkeeper and farmer, landowner and laborer.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>In context the point that Sen is making is that the idea we have of democracy as a "western" ideal that we've inherited from the greeks and imposed on the rest of the world is bogus, and in fact democracy taken in the general 
as any form of collective decision making that involves its participants equally in the process is found in my cultures.</p>


<p>I'd like to highlight something else: The democratic ideal that he is describing is actually quite far from the western one, and it's better.
These days in a lot of the west we have this very anemic idea of democracy, where we've basically reduced it to voting,
and voting is in many ways supposed to be the thing you do when better ways of doing democracy have failed.
Reducing democracy to voting is already failure, even before you get into the question of what voting system you should use.</p>


<p>Really the starting point for democracy is not the vote but the discussion (not the debate!) - people getting together to try to figure out the best solution, in a way that respects everyone's needs and viewpoints. Everyone speaks, everyone listens. You don't necessarily have to all agree at the end (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">Consensus-building</a> is sometimes a good idea, but it's hard and not always worth it), but everyone has the option to be heard.</p>


<p>This isn't to say that voting is never a good feature in democracy. Voting has a lot of advantages when what you want is a relatively low cost way of deciding between a small number of options, but most decision making isn't like that (and the decision theorists who tell you it is are lying to you). Most of the interesting parts of the democratic process consist of getting to the point where you can reduce things to that small number of decisions.</p>


<p>This is particularly useful for <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/11/democracy-for-lunch/">decisions that don't matter very much</a>, because it lets you get them out of the way quickly, but for more momentous decisions it largely comes at the end when you've exhausted the possibility of agreement.</p>


<p>One of the big limitations of voting over discussion is that it cannot put new things on the table. You can vote for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_the_above#Re-open_Nominations_(RON)">RON</a> (the only candidate that can promise change!) in some systems, but most voting in practice does not meaningfully allow that.</p>


<p>This, I think, suggests a feature that is important and absent from most voting systems: They need to be able to fail. One possible conclusion of voting should be that it concludes that you weren't ready for voting yet.</p>


<p>Consensus seeking votes are the easiest example of such a thing: Unless 100% of people agree on an option, the vote fails and you have to go back to discussion. You can do similar things by requiring supermajorities: If \(\frac{2}{3}\) of people approve some outcome, you select that, otherwise back to the drawing board.</p>


<p>I think one reason we overfocus on voting is that it's easier to do at scale (lotteries are also easy to do at scale, but we don't like those for various reasons - some good, some bad). The democratic ideal of discussion really only works with small groups - even our parliaments are too large to really manage it, let alone our populations.</p>


<p>I feel like there are probably systems that solve this by essentially patchworking together many small democratic groups, but perhaps the biggest problem with getting there is how little small scale democracy there is in most people's lives. The overwhelming majority of small group interactions we have result in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-15:27.html">someone basically taking charge</a>, and because people are increasingly atomized most of us don't seem to be part of any communities that could be or would benefit from being democratically run (maybe this isn't true? It's certainly my impression).</p>


<p>I do think one part of that is the absence of good <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/the-missing-social-technology-sector/">social technology</a> for this. John Gastil's <a href="https://amzn.to/3ePnt2m">Democracy in Small Groups</a> describes how small group democracy is actually implemented in practice in some of the communities where we do have that, and frankly I'm a democracy fan and I still think it sounds <em>awful</em>.</p>


<p>Maybe what is needed is something like <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a>? A toolkit of easy to use small group democratic processes that people can just plug in to their lives and use where appropriate.</p>

<p>Today's reading comes from <a href="https://amzn.to/2VMdTVs">Random Justice: On Lotteries and Legal Decision-Making</a>, page 75-76:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>random selection is intended to provide defendants and litigants with the opportunity to be tried by a representative cross-section of the population. The idea here is that fair and democratic social arrangements require that people be accorded the chance to be tried by juries drawn from a cross-sectionally representative pool. That a randomly selected jury will provide the opportunity to be tried by a representative cross-section of the population is, however, by no means guaranteed. [...] a perfectly representative sample is the average ideal of many random samples of a population and is not to be expected in any particular randomly drawn sample - or on any particular petit jury. Perhaps most importantly of all, even if random selection were to yield a jury perfectly representative of the population, the appropriateness of the outcome might still be contested.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is actually a really excellent point for tying together a number of my interest areas.</p>


<p>In particular it prompts me to think about:</p>


<ul>
<li>The difference between statistical fairness and individual fairness.</li>
<li>What "representative" really means.</li>
<li>Is representativeness good?</li>
<li>The interplay between justice and identity.</li>
<li>The role of legibility in diversity initiatives.</li>
</ul>


<p>As is well known <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/09/towards-a-more-perfect-democracy/">I'm rather a big fan of random selection</a>, and one of the reasons for it is the guaranteed proportionality properties of it. However, there are some major distinctive features of juries compared to the situations I've focused on that I'd not previously appreciated until reading this passage just now (despite having read it before!).</p>


<p>First off, consider the difficulty of representativeness. Say we've got 12 jurors. Any group whose prevalence in the population is not a multiple of \(\frac{1}{12}\) will not be perfectly represented in the jury - they'll either be over or underrepresented.</p>


<p>This is a particularly big deal for minority groups. For example, consider Muslims. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom">Wikipedia tells me</a> that 4.4% of the UK population are muslim. Therefore the correct number of muslims on a jury of 12 people is 0.528. This is, obviously, hard to achieve.
Random selection achieves this on average by assigning one muslim to the jury 32% of the time, no muslims 59% of the time, and more than one muslim 9% of the time (these numbers are all rounded). That's all very well, but if you're a muslim and you consider it important to have muslims on your jury, it's of small comfort if you're one of the 59% who doesn't get any. Statistical fairness is all very well, but an individual up for trial might quite reasonably expect that it should be fair in their individual case too.</p>


<p>This leads further to the question of which groups you want represented.
For example, it might be important to consider ethnicity.
Again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_British">according to Wikipedia</a>, 81.9% of the UK population is white. This means you want 9.83 white people on your jury. Depending on whether you round that to 9 or 10, that gives you 2 or 3 people of colour on your jury. But which racial groups do you want in those 2 or 3? People of colour have certain unifying experiences, certainly (e.g. being on the receiving end of racism), but they're very far from a unified group.</p>


<p>This gets worse when you consider intersections. For example, one can be representative of both ethnicity and gender without being representative of their intersection. Does it matter if all three of your people of colour are men but you make up the gender balance by including more white women? It probably does. Intersectionality tells us that the interplay of racism and sexism is significant in ways that are more than the sum of their parts.</p>


<p>Let's take a step back and ask why this matters. It matters because how we form judgements about people is significantly affected by how legible they are to us, and identity is a big part of this.
I've <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/06/the-ethics-of-false-negatives-in-interviewing/">previously written about how this affects interviewing</a>: The heuristics we use for judging people are based on those that are reliable for people who we are familiar with, a group that is generally heavily biased towards people who are like us. These heuristics are not necessarily prejudicial outside that group, but they may be wildly inaccurate.</p>


<p>This suggests one obvious modification to the principle of representativeness in juries: Where the speaker is part of a minority group, we should aim to err on the side of overrepresentation of that group in the jury.</p>


<p>However, this is tricky, and risks falling afoul of what Amartya Sen, in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/3cDC1jV">Identity and Violence</a> calls the <em>assumption of singularity</em> - the idea that we all have a single immutable identity that has primacy.</p>


<p>A particularly ironic example of how identity can affect our judgement comes from Miranda Fricker's book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3cGXfgG">Epistemic Injustice</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Imagine that a hearer responsibly judges a speaker to be untrustworthy (because insincere) owing to the fact that the speaker avoids looking her in the eye, frequently looks askance, and pauses self-consciously in mid-sentence as if to work out his story. The speaker’s behaviour justifies the hearer’s judgement inasmuch as it fits an empirically reliable stereotype of insincerity. In fact, however, this individual is speaking entirely ingenuously, and his shifty manner is simply due to the rather idiosyncratic manifestations of his extraordinary personal shyness. This speaker, let us agree, constitutes an exception to an empirically reliable rule, and thus the testimonial injustice he suffers is caused not by prejudice but simply by bad luck. What should be said about such an example?</p>
<p>If we were to consider this shyness example to be an instance of testimonial injustice, then it would be a case of non-culpable testimonial injustice: clearly the hearer has done nothing for which she is blameworthy, either epistemically or ethically.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>What should be said about this example is that somehow Fricker has managed to be either unaware of or indifferent to the existence of people with autism. She has taken a generally (but not wholly! Difficulty with eye contact may also result from e.g. trauma) reliable heuristic on neurotypical people, and declared that because the error is not based on an identity group that she recognises as valid, the error is not culpable.</p>


<p>This is almost an example of what I've previously described as <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-23-09:37.html">legibility privileges</a>: The relevant features of identity are ones that are, apparently, illegible to Fricker (autism as a feature identity is perfectly legible, but <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html">legibility is a relationship</a>), and so are discounted from consideration.
If you have an autistic muslim woman on trial and the jury selection carefully is carefully padded out with muslim women in order to give her a fair trial but you end up with a jury of 100% neurotypicals (which is highly likely due to the relatively low prevalence of autism) then the selection would potentially be completely missing the point.</p>


<p>As with many seemingly intractable problems, this admits a relatively feasible solution: You have to ask them. People have choice over what aspects of their identity have primacy, and we have a moral duty to respect those choices.</p>


<p>In the case of the jury, what seems like a natural solution to me is to start the process of jury selection with a negotiation between the prosecution, the defence, and the judge, about some criteria that the defence would like to ensure is represented in the jury, and then ensure that (say) three out of the twelve jurors satisfy those criteria. Both those three and the other nine would still be randomly selected, but they would be selected from within fixed subsets of the population.</p>


<p>You'd need careful guidelines for how this is to be implemented in practice, and I'm not at all an expert in law or jury selection, so it's likely that I'm missing important features, but I do think some principle like this is worth considering every time you're making a decision about someone - whether it's a jury, as in this example, a hiring panel, or otherwise.</p>
