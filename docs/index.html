<p class="subtitle">An Annoyingly Hard Algorithm to Beat</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-22</dd>
</dl>


<p>I have a vice, and that vice is clever solutions. I <em>love</em> it when I can hit a problem with some giant theory hammer that cracks it right open. I don't claim this is a <em>good</em> way to solve problems, but it sure is aesthetic.</p>


<p>So let me tell you about an algorithm I resent <em>so</em> much. It looks like this:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="n">failures</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

<span class="c1"># 10 is arbitrary and the value that works best</span>
<span class="c1"># varies by problem.</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">failures</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">try_a_random_thing</span><span class="p">()</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">the_thing_succeeded</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">failures</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">elif</span> <span class="n">the_thing_was_bad</span><span class="p">():</span>
        <span class="n">failures</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> 
</pre></div>


<p>I call these failure/success loops. As far as I know they're idiosyncratic to me but I'm sure it's a reinvention because they're so obvious.</p>


<p>The basic idea is that you can use them to spend more time on things that have a high chance of succeeding. The parameter value (10 in this case) basically reduces variance at the cost of higher overhead, but either way you end up running things that have a higher chance of working for longer (I haven't bothered to do the maths of the exact distribution, because I inevitably end up using these in situations where success changes the probabiltiy of future successes anyway).</p>


<p>Why do I resent the failure/success loop algorithm?</p>


<p>Well because it's so dumb and it keeps beating better options.</p>


<p>For example suppose you have a multi-armed bandit problem, where you have \(n\) arms and you want to pull arms that succeed and not pull arms that fail. Try the following:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">bandit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">arms</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">max_pulls</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">pulls</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">arm</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">arms</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">failures</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
            <span class="c1"># Why three? Who knows! But somehow three</span>
            <span class="c1"># often ends up being a good choice here.</span>
            <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">failures</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">:</span>
                <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">arm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pull</span><span class="p">()</span>
                <span class="n">pulls</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
                <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">pulls</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="n">max_pulls</span><span class="p">:</span>
                    <span class="k">return</span>
                <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">result</span><span class="p">:</span>
                    <span class="n">failures</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
                <span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
                    <span class="n">failures</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This keeps pulling each arm until it's failed three times in a row, then moves on to the next one.</p>


<p>Is this optimal? No, obviously not. This is a well studied problem with lots of interesting theory about regret bounds. From a theoretical point of view this algorithm is garbage.</p>


<p>And also every damn time I try to write a multiarmed bandit code and feel super pleased with myself at getting to use some clever theory I find rough edges, go "Hmm... What if I just insert a bit of pregaming to prime the bandit with better information?" and then before I know it I've deleted the bandit code and am left with something that looks like the above.</p>


<p>Why does this keep happening?</p>


<p>I think there are a couple of reasons.</p>


<p>The first is that the situations where they end up beating out clever algorithms for me tend to be ones where <em>nothing</em> is going to work especially well. For example the above bandit algorithm seems to work pretty well in cases where most of the bandit arms have no chance of working and a few of the arms have a not-terrible chance of working. What ends up happening in these cases is that clever algorithms end up not buying you much, occasionally get stuck in weird ways, and you pay high overhead for their complexity.</p>


<p>The second is that the virtue of this algorithm is it's incredibly simple and thus it's easy to tinker with - you can fiddle with the parameter on the fly, you can try other things in the middle, and it pretty much all works fine. There's no complicated state to maintain, and there's plenty of room to maneuver as the result of the simplicity, so even if the base algorithm doesn't work something like it will.</p>


<p>In some sense this is perhaps evidence that the algorithm is less dumb than it seems, but that doesn't mean I resent it any less.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Questions to Ask When Bored</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-17</dd>
</dl>


<p>I was thinking about boredom yesterday and <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1283657884392460290">asked about it on Twitter</a> and had a few conversations about it. This caused me to realise that there are really a lot of different things we're lumping under the heading of boredom, and it might be useful to distinguish them more carefully.</p>


<p>Some of the things we might label as boredom include depression, listlessness, restlessness, fatigue... but rather than trying to put labels on all the different states of being bored I thought it might be useful to narrow it down instead to concrete questions you can ask about the felt sense of the boredom:</p>


<ul>
<li>Am I bored of a specific thing that I have to do? (Being in a meeting, working on something tedious, etc)</li>
<li>Do I not have anything interesting to do? (e.g. because all of your normal hobbies are inaccessible to you right now)</li>
<li>Am I unable to find <em>anything</em> interesting right now? (You're probably depressed)</li>
<li>Do the things I am trying to do seem in principle interesting but I'm not in the mood for them? (You might have an unment need and anything that doesn't meet that need)</li>
<li>Am I trying to do things that I don't have the energy for? (You're tired, pick something easier)</li>
<li>Are there things that I want to do but also want not to do? (e.g. they've got a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-06-09:51.html">fnord</a> or an ugh field associated with them)</li>
</ul>


<p>These questions are all useful debugging tools for helping understand what's actually going on, and treating it as a practical problem to solve. Some of them may be hard to solve in the moment (e.g. if you're exhausted and have no good low energy hobbies it's probably not the right time to try to think of one), but the information they provide in the moment can be used to solve the problem another time.</p>


<p>In general I find that better introspective understanding also tends to improve my emotional state. Boredom feels bad in part because it signals a poorly understood problem, and getting to the root of what that problem is lessens that feeling.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Habit Overload</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-16</dd>
</dl>


<p>Attention Conservation Notice: Personal debugging. May be of interest if you have similar problems, which you probably do, but I've not made any particular effort to generalise it into a coherent point.</p>


<p>I've been noticing recently that a lot of my recurring habits have been slipping,
so I'm attempting to take stock of this and try to figure out what to do about it.</p>


<p>I think the problem has a couple of roots:</p>


<ol>
<li>I'm trying to do too much. There's plenty of time to do all the habits if I do nothing else, and even if I do a reasonable amount of work on my PhD, but the reality is that I don't do a reasonable amount of work on my PhD because my two modes are "not really doing enough work on it" and "total all consuming obsession", and the latter tends to impinge on the habits and make me feel bad about neglecting them.</li>
<li>Some of the habits probably weren't working that well for me.</li>
<li>Some of the habits have lost cues that were previously helpful for keeping on top of them.</li>
<li>My planning system became lightly aversive because it was trying to keep me on track despite the above fighting against me.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think this can mostly be solved by taking stock a bit of what's reasonable, and deciding what habits to drop and what to keep, and part of that is looking at what's not working and dropping or modifying it based on where it fits into the above.</p>


<p>For example I've dropped my <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1283138137129193472">daily paper reading habit</a> because I decided it wasn't working that well for me - it felt high overhead (because I had to decide to read) and low value (I'd be better served chatting on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3DkPGuAZiGbeNYlwje6jTlFxz9peIGnjSuZTwF4NGM/edit?usp=sharing">Weird CS Theory Discord</a>) or reading a book.</p>


<p>Another example is that I had a habit of rereading bits of books I'd previously read every day. I've almost entirely dropped that, not deliberately. I think I'm going to formally drop that - doing book driven posts on here fills the same need.</p>


<p>I've also, for the moment, dropped my planning system (which was coping board based). It's a good system and I want to get back to it but I think I need to leave some time for my life to normalise into a new routine before I bring it back, and right now it has a bit of guilt attached to it, so I've thrown away the cards and will resume when it feels right to do so.</p>


<p>Another thing that's been a problem is that I've been reading much less recently. This is I think a loss of a cue - I previously started reading during my morning coffee, which put me in the right mindset for the rest of the day and I would read more later as and when the mood struck me. Recently I've been doing morning pages during morning coffee, which is great and is a high value habit that I will absolutely retain, but robs me of that cue. I've started finishing morning pages by doing at least five minutes of reading, which I'm hoping will help with that.</p>


<p>This notebook itself is, of course, one of the daily habits. For the moment I don't plan to drop it as such - I get a lot of value out of it, and I think other people do. Recently it's become a bit erratic and lower quality I think, but it's in the nature of a daily writing practice that that will happen. I might however start skipping days where I've otherwise been doing a lot of writing, or otherwise make some minor modifications to it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Nice Problems to Have</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-15</dd>
</dl>


<p>I've been thinking about "nice problems to have" as a phenomenon recently. I have a feeling they're widely misunderstood.</p>


<p>My standard response to the concept has often been "Yes but nice problems to have are still problems", but actually I think it goes deeper than that: Nice problems to have are also rarely actually nice to have. The phrase is misleading.</p>


<p>What we generally mean when we say "nice problem to have" is that the <em>preconditions</em> for having this problem are nice to have. i.e. you cannot have this problem unless some other nice thing happens first.
This is not at all a reliable predictor of the amount of suffering involved.</p>


<p>Consider, for example, having all your friends and family constantly making demands on you, far beyond your capacity to satisfy, to the point where it would be emotionally exhausting even if you could say yes to everyone but also you have to say no to most of them and they will resent you for it.
This is obviously an intensely painful problem, right?</p>


<p>Now suppose it's because you come from poverty and have landed a well paid job. Suddenly it's a "nice problem to have" (you have it because you're being well paid! Being well paid is good!), but that doesn't change how miserable it is.</p>


<p>The thing is, by definition, "nice problems to have" are ones that are not going to be shared by a lot of people (otherwise the preconditions would just be normal behaviour and it wouldn't be a nice problem to have).
As a result:</p>


<ol>
<li>Most people probably won't be able to relate to it, because their lived experiences will be so different.</li>
<li>People will be envious of you for the nice thing.</li>
</ol>


<p>Thus the defining characteristic about nice problems to have is not that they are nice, but that you will be afforded no sympathy for having them. Nice problems to have are the opposite of nice: They isolate you from the ability to <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-should-complain-about-it">complain about them</a>, which removes a major bonding activity with people who have not been successful in the same way as you, and also causes you to feel worse about the problems with those who do not share your burden.</p>


<p>There is a phenomenon of people succeeding and leaving their former friends behind, and there are many very bad reasons why people do this, but I suspect the nice problems to have issue is one of them: None of their former friends are able to be remotely sympathetic to things that are very real sources of their suffering (and indeed that unrelatability of it is probably <em>part</em> of their suffering).</p>


<p>This is in many ways a variant of the <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/being-deep-in-an-abstraction-stack">abstraction stack</a> problem - you need people around you who just <em>get</em> the things you want to talk about - and the solution is probably the same: Regardless of who else you hang out with (and you should hang out with a variety of people) you do need <em>some</em> people you can talk to who understand your problems, even if they're supposedly nice problems to have.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Living Room Rules</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1281131593948692480">my Twitter the other day</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>A pattern I notice over and over again: you don't have to get all of a community's norms right from day one, but you do have to get a community's norms of agreeing on community norms right from day one or your community is doomed to fall apart, probably messily.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>One of the ways in which I have seen this manifest is tech communities and the adoption of code of conducts.
Tech communities that don't have codes of conduct from very early on tend to have vicious battles when it comes to adopting them, with a lot of the existing members of the community absolutely livid about the idea that they should be held to specific rules of behaviour.
This is what happens if you build a community without building legitimacy for a mode of forming norms.</p>


<p>One way to solve this is to have a code of conduct from the beginning, and it may be worth doing this anyway (especially a generic "no racism, transphobia, etc." one), but I think using this as the main solution sets the bar too low, and there is an easier and more flexible approach that will build a healthy and functional community:
Simply declare "Le code de conduite, c'est moi". This is your space, as the founder of the community, and the people there are your guests. They should behave accordingly, and if they are not prepared to behave accordingly they are welcome to leave.</p>


<p>These are what I call <em>living room rules</em> - you are treating the space as your virtual living room. As the host you are responsible for people having a good time, and the guests are responsible for behaving well in your space.</p>


<p>Living room rules work best for small communities whose management is well within the scope of a single individual.
The reason for this is that as a single individual founder you have authority over the space, and thus over how people behave within it. Your word is law. Once authority is delegated to multiple people, the possibility of conflict exists, and the authority is weakened (this can, of course, be a good thing too).</p>


<p>A Code of Conduct is essentially a tool you can use for claiming authority over people's behaviour without possessing that authority on your own.
You, a member of the community or one of many organisers, have the ability to say "This behaviour is not on, because it says so in the code of conduct". By making the rules of the space explicit, authority to get people to conform to those rules is conferred.</p>


<p>But you can just skip that step and claim authority on your own. It's allowed, I promise. You do this every time you have your friends around for dinner (a thing that we used to do prior to 2020) and it generally works fine.</p>


<p>Why might you want to do this?</p>


<p>Well, it's more flexible and produces better results. The goal is not to get people to follow some set of rules to the letter, the goal is to get a community that behaves in a positive way. Explicit systems of rules are easy to rules lawyer, and it's hard for them to account for every scenario. That doesn't mean a code of conduct is bad in and of itself - they're on balance probably good things - but they are <em>insufficient</em> and a community where people are constantly skirting the edge of the code of conduct is one that you might as well let fail because it's basically dead anyway.</p>


<p>In contrast, when a community is small enough that you can have it overseen by a single person, that person is able to use their judgement and shape the behaviour of the community into more positive directions, and it's much harder to rules lawyer against individual personal judgement.</p>


<p>There are a couple reasons people don't want to do this:</p>


<ul>
<li>Claiming authority is kinda scary, at least if you're the sort of person worth trusting with authority. "Because I say so" is a harder thing to say than "because these reasons", even if you are the one who defined those reasons.</li>
<li>Some people are going to try hard to argue with and manipulate you to get the outcomes they want, and then you have to go through the social awkwardness of showing that person the door.</li>
<li>It's hard to do well, and it feels like a personal judgement when you don't do it well.</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm still figuring out the details of how to do it well myself, but I think the following principles are roughly what I'm trying to follow:</p>


<ul>
<li>Claim this authority explicitly and early.</li>
<li>Be explicit about the sort of space that you are trying to achieve. "This is what I want out of this space, though details may be subject to change, and I am the arbiter of whether that is being achieved."</li>
<li>Don't be an asshole with your authority (obviously), but more than that do your best to be someone who people are glad has authority. Your role here is to be the host, and to use the authority that gives you to make sure everyone has a good time.</li>
<li>When you make decisions, record them somewhere. This can evolve into a document that you can use to better define and shape your community norms. Eventually it might acquire authority in its own right, once the community starts to outgrow you.</li>
</ul>


<p>I've run a few online spaces more or less on these principles. The most explicit is my recent creation of the Weird CS Theory Community Discord, which started with me creating <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3DkPGuAZiGbeNYlwje6jTlFxz9peIGnjSuZTwF4NGM/edit?usp=sharing">a document based on these principles fairly early on</a>. Hard to say how it's going, because it's early days yet, but we've mostly got the vibe I want and the one incident which promtped the creation of the document was entirely civil even before I intervened, and the intervention was well received.</p>


<p>Should all online spaces be run this way? Absolutely not. Not even all small ones. But I do think there should be more online spaces run this way, and that many more people would benefit from running one than currently do.</p>
