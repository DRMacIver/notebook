<p class="subtitle">Requiem for a pair of trousers</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-17</dd>
</dl>


<p>Based on random prompting this morning think today's post is supposed to be about using stories to communicate philosophical ideas, but I don't wanna, so instead I'm going to tell you a story to communicate philosophical ideas.</p>


<p>I've spent about the last 45 minutes sitting out in the sun destroying a pair of trousers.</p>


<p>This isn't a euphemism, or a side effect, or anything else. I was literally sitting there in my garden taking a seam ripper to a pair of trousers, taking it apart for spare material.</p>


<p>The trousers were dying - there was a hole in the crotch, and the surrounding material was thin enough that if I'd patched it it'd probably have just ripped again. I didn't have any material to make a patch, and also the trousers weren't very good (and were a little tight) in the first place so I probably wouldn't have worn them even once patched. I have vague intentions of using some of the material to make home made face masks, but I'm not sure how suitable it will actually be for that, and most of it won't be used that way.</p>


<p>I didn't get very far. So far I've removed the back pockets and the zip and some of the other parts have been partially separated.</p>


<p>There is no sense in which this is a reasonable use of my time. I'm not especially good at sewing, or in this case unsewing. I could buy a cloth facemask for not that much money. If you look at the day rate I could charge a software company for my consulting services I could probably have bought two new pairs of trousers for the price.</p>


<p>These trousers came from somewhere. There's no spontaneous generation of trousers - someone sewed these together somewhere. Probably, I must admit, in a sweatshop. They're from Gap, who I doubt have the most ethical of production practices (there's a high cost in human suffering for the prevalence of cheap clothing. I'd be lying if I said I was very good at taking that into account in my purchasing habits).</p>


<p>I've probably already spent more disassembling these trousers than that unknown factory worker spent assembling them.</p>


<p>It may interest you to know that I'm alternating writing this post with continuing my trouser disassembly project. I just removed a belt loop.</p>


<p>It probably doesn't interest you to know this. That's OK. There is probably no sense in which reading this post is a reasonable use of your time either.</p>


<p>I said there was no sense in which disassembling these trousers was a reasonable use of my time, but actually that's not true. There are two important senses:</p>


<ol>
<li>I wanted to do it.</li>
<li>I feel better for having done so.</li>
</ol>


<p>I wrote yesterday about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-16-12:06.html">acedia</a>, the sense of being disconnected from sources of meaning, and how working with your hands is one possible antidote to that. I'm not going to claim trouser disassembly is the great cure for modern ills, but there's definitely something nice about sitting in the garden with your hands occupied, thinking as you work on semi autopilot.</p>


<p>I didn't know how to use a seam ripper before this. I was vaguely aware seam rippers were a thing, but I had to look them up in order to figure out that I already owned one in my sewing kit. So one nice side effect of this is that I now know how to use a seam ripper.</p>


<p>I was going to say that this was completely useless knowledge, but then I realised that actually I could use the seam ripper to remove the label from the inside T-shirt I was wearing, which has a really weirdly annoyingly large label.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, I forgot that the seams on labels are usually structural - they're not added on top of the seam they're attached to, but are sewn directly into it, so now I have a hole in my T-shirt that I need to sew up.</p>


<p>This is probably a metaphor for something, but I don't know what.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on Acedia</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-16</dd>
</dl>


<p>I recently read <a href="https://amzn.to/2X2QOP2">Leisure: The Basis of Culture</a> which is a strange book, which I'll be exploring a different angle on in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/">my newsletter</a> on Monday, but one thought from it that I thought was interesting and worth exploring further was the idea of <em>acedia</em>.</p>


<p>This post is just some gathering of notes from different sources related to the subject, plus some vague thoughts..</p>


<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acedia">Wikipedia entry on acedia</a> has the following to say:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Acedia (/əˈsiːdiə/; also accidie or accedie /ˈæksɪdi/, from Latin acedĭa, and this from Greek ἀκηδία, "negligence", ἀ- "lack of" -κηδία "care") has been variously defined as a state of listlessness or torpor, of not caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world. In ancient Greece akidía literally meant an inert state without pain or care. Early Christian monks used the term to define a spiritual state of listlessness and from there the term developed a markedly Christian moral tone. In modern times it has been taken up by literary figures and connected to depression.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The wikipedia article <a href="http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/acedia.html">cites what is apparently a blog for hermits</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Acedia (or accedie) has a narrow religious definition but is a far larger and wider psychological and spiritual term relevant to the history of eremiticism and solitude.</p>
<p>The narrow sense is that of sloth, indolence, laziness, as in the Western world's list of seven capital sins. Eastern Christianity is a little more comprehensive in referring to seven "temptations." Acedia is a psychological rather than moral condition, with implications for modern attitudes toward culture, conformity, and contentment. Acedia was a historical bane to monks, hermits, solitaries, and -- by extension -- to any one spiritually or intellectually inclined.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The concept of acedia begins with the ever-observant desert fathers and mothers who first perceived and diagnosed the condition. Their first impulse was to shoo it away like a pesky insect by keeping occupied, as in the narrative of Anthony beset "by many sinful thoughts" and cured by angelic advice to stay busy  plaiting rope. Poemen avers that "acedia is there every time one begins something, and there is no worse passion, but if one recognizes it for what it is, one will gain peace." And John Cassian adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also good to recall what Abba Moses, one of the most experienced of the fathers, told me. I had not been living long in the desert when I was troubled by listlessness [i.e., acedia]. So I went to him and said: Yesterday I was greatly troubled and weakened by listlessness, and I was not able to free myself from it until I went to see Abba Paul. Abba Moses replied to me by saying: So far from freeing yourself from it, you have surrendered to it completely and become its slave. You must realize that it will attack all the more severely because you have deserted your post, unless from now on you strive to subdue it through patience, prayer and manual labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly acedia is not willful sloth or indolence, less so "sin," but a spiritual lethargy or indifference, a turpitude that affects the well-intentioned. Amma Theodora says:</p>
<p>You should realize that as soon as you intend to live in peace, at once evil comes and weighs down your soul through acedia, faint-heartedness, and evil thoughts. It also attacks your body through sickness, debility, weakening of the knees, and all the members. It dissipates the strength of soul and body. ... But if we are vigilant, all the temptations fall away.</p>
<p>A practical experience of acedia is described by the desert hermit Heraclides, who received a brother troubled by restlessness in his new cell. Heraclides advised him not to follow an extreme regimen of self-discipline but to eat, drink, and sleep as needed. He only asked that the brother not leave his cell. But, the narrator tells us, the brother fell "prey to acedia" and doubted the old man's advice. The brother followed his regimen but when he went to bed he found a demon lying on it, gnashing its teeth at him. The brother fled his cell to the old man's dwelling, imploring his help. Heraclides, seeing that the younger man had not followed his counsel to stay in his cell, refused to open, but the next morning, finding him still at the doorstep, Heraclides took pity on him. "Then, according to his capacity, he taught him the discipline of the solitary life, and in a short time he became a good monk."</p>
<p>John Cassian went further than his conversation with Abba Moses to describe the physical symptoms so literally, even to the hour of the day when they peak, that acedia became known as the "noonday devil." He provides an excellent description of the psychology of acedia as well, indicating that acedia is a "tedium or perturbation of heart ... akin to dejection and especially felt by wandering monks and solitaries, a persistent and obnoxious enemy to such as dwell in the desert." He goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this [acedia] besieges the unhappy mind, it begets aversion from the place, boredom with one's cell, and scorn and contempt for one's brethren, whether they be dwelling with one or some way off, as careless and unspiritual-minded persons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The listlessness of acedia is akin to a feeling of inertness, John Cassian notes, producing no spiritual fruit, a sense of any practice being "empty of spiritual profit." John's remedy, following desert tradition, is a level of sustained activity approximating rigorous physical labor and what were to be called works of mercy, which fend off cynicisms. Physical labor as a solution is seen in the example of the first Christian desert hermit Paul, who regularly wove baskets of palm leaves. But being too far from a market to sell them Paul would burn his handiwork once a year and start over.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In The Book of Human Emotions, page 16, Tiffany Watt Smith describes it as:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Acedia (pronounced a-seed-ee-a) or sometimes called accidie, is an emotion that has no real equivalent today. It was a short-lived but disastrous emotional crisis, usually striking between 11AM and 4PM. Its first signs were listeness and irritability, but it didn't take long to turn into desolation and despair.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the sixth century =, acedia was dropped from the list of mortal sins. Some of its symptoms were absorbed into the illness melancholia, a forerunner to our own states of depression and anxiety (see: MELANCHOLY). The rest became the moral vice sloth. Though people still spoke of feeling acedia, it came to mean something more like inertia - an equivalent, perhaps, to that listless feeling which descends on a rainy Sunday morning (see: APATHY).</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In "Leisure: The Basis of Culture" acedia is introduced as follows (p27):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What did the old code of conduct mean by idleness, by <em>acedia</em>?</p>
<p>To begin with, it meant something other than we usually mean when we speak of the "root of all evils."</p>
<p>Idleness, for the older code of behavior, meant especially this: that the human being had given up on the very responsibility that comes with his dignity: that he does not want to be what God wants him to be, and that means that he does not want to be what he really, and in the ultimate sense, <em>is</em>. <em>Acedia</em> is the "despair of weakness," of which Kierkegaard said that it consists in someone "despairingly" not wanting "to be oneself". The metaphysical-theological concept of idleness means, then, that man finally does not agree with his own existence; that behind all his energetic activitity, he is not at one with himself; that, as the Middle Ages expressed it, sadness has seized him in the face of the divine Goodness that lives within him - and this sadness is that "sadness of the world" spoken of in the bible.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In Voices: The Educational Formation of Conscience, Thomas Green has a slightly different take (p. 40):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[When one behaves correctly but does not care to be correct] the internal speech of the self would be: "It doesn't really matter, but this is the way they like it. I know what they want, so I'll go along with this senseless charade even though nothing vital is at stake." Such a posture of detachment is the perspective of the uninvolved, the apathetic. It is the condition of anomie.</p>
<p>The key to this interior speech is found in that indefinite, obscure, omnipresent, and distant 'they'. How remote, ho w disguised, 'they' always are! How senseless; yet, at the same time, how pervassive are the norms of everyday life when viewed simply as the edicts that 'they' deliver, and how thoroughly, under like circumstances, do those edicts lack even the most minute measure of moral authority! This condition, as nearly as I can describe it, is closely related to a kindred state that the medievals describe as <em>acedia</em>. i.e., a kind of spiritual torpor or sickness that nowadays is often expressed as <em>ennui</em> or boredom. The ancient idea extended, however, to something more fundamental even than mere boredom. It included the notion of a certain rebelllion, a conditon of being asleep to life, a resolute rejection of any possible contentment with being what one is, namely, a human being and thus essentially a creature.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Both Green and Pieper seem to be framing acedia as a form of disconnection from sources of meaning. For Pieper this source of meaning is spiritual, for Green it is full participation as a member in a normative community.</p>


<p>It's interesting that the hermitage site suggests working with your hands as an antidote to acedia.
I'm put in mind of Matthew Crawford's <a href="https://amzn.to/3bzPSqt">Shop Class as Soulcraft</a> where he argues that professions that are very hands on are in fact much more nourishing sources of meaning than office work (I do not especially recommend this book, although there are things I like about it).</p>


<p>I'm also put in mind of James C. Scott's <a href="https://amzn.to/2X0qAN3">Two Cheers For Anarchism</a>, where he argues that we should think about work not solely in terms of its productivity, but in terms of its effect on workers:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What if we were to ask a different question of institutions and activities than the narrow neoclassical question of how efficient they are in terms of costs (e.g. resources, labor, capital) per unit of a given, specified product? What if we were to ask what kind of people a given activity or institution fostered? Any activity we can imagine, any institution, no matters what its manifest purpose, is also, willy-nilly, transforming people:</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>[the assembly line] was deliberately designed to eliminate the artisanal-craft knowledge, and the power this knowledge conferred on workers, that characterized the carriage-making era.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lx4yMm">Talking About Machines</a> Julian Orr describes such a community of artisanal-craft knowledge, in the form of photocopier technicians at Xerox PARC. These technicians clearly have both Scott's artisanal-craft knowledge and Green's normation to a community of practice. Reading Orr's descriptions of it, the technicians certainly <em>sound</em> satisfied with their jobs, but it's also very clear that management would really rather not have to deal with the complex messy realities of depending on an actual community of experts.</p>


<p>I'm additionally put in mind of Rebecca Solnit's <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ar3MOL">A Paradise Built in Hell</a> where she talks about the communities that arise in disasters, where she shows how people band together towards a common cause, and find it a powerful source of meaning - in many ways the aftermath of a disaster is a positive experience for people in these communities.</p>


<p>Pieper argues that Total Work is the source of this acedia, or perhaps that acedia is the source of total work, but it seems to me that communities of people working together towards a common cause, in ways that allow each of us to grow as a person, are in fact the <em>cure</em> for acedia, and the problem is perhaps not work per se but the way that power has reshaped work into something that treats workers as a resource to extract value from instead of people to develop alongside.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Truth and the Ghost Library</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-16</dd>
</dl>


<p>Ritual and its Consequences, p. 162:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[Fundamentalism] equates truth, which is nonindividual and supraindividual, with its interpretation, which is invariably personal and conditional.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this claim is interesting and mostly true, but also mostly false. That might be because of my interpretation of it, which is invariably personal and conditional.</p>


<p>I'm reading James C. Scott's "Domination and the Arts of Resistance" at the moment.</p>


<p>The book, as with most of Scott's work, looks at an aspect of how people behave in response to power imbalances.
In societies when one group dominates another, such as caste societies, or historical slavery in North America,
the way those groups talk among themselves is very different from the way they talk in public.</p>


<p>This leads to the idea of <em>hidden transcripts</em>.
The idea is that there is a public transcript, which is the record (usually implicit) of what goes on in public,
and the hidden transcripts, which record how the groups talk among themselves.
Both the oppressed and the oppressor have hidden transcripts that are very different from the public transcript,
which can be thought of an elaborate ritual to maintain order, in which the oppressors perform strength and the oppressed perform deference.</p>


<p>Hidden transcripts are a key part of the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-16-14:22.html">ghost knowledge</a> that pervades society - knowledge that is built and widely shared inside a community of discourse, but is never written down and is not widely known outside of that community. Unlike much ghost knowledge, which is merely <em>not</em> shared, the hidden transcripts are actively kept from those outside of the community as a protective measure.</p>


<p>You can think of knowledge about the world as being a kind of infinite ghost library, with different groups occupying (with varying degrees of jealousy) their territories within the library.</p>


<p>This is a key part my objection to the quoted passage I opened with: Interpretation is not just personal, it's very much driven by what you know, and who you talk to. People interpret in groups, and those interpretations become hidden transcripts within the ghost library.</p>


<p>Scott is careful to point out that these hidden transcripts <em>also</em> don't necessarily represent any sort of "true selves" of the oppressed, but are instead another social order, which may have its own barriers to authenticity, but I do think though that there is a gradient where the more hidden a transcript it is, the more sincere it is:</p>


<p>Scott, on page 26, lists the following under "Hypothetical Discursive Sites, Arranged by Audience, under Slavery":</p>


<ol>
<li>Harsh master/overseer</li>
<li>Indulgent master or overseer</li>
<li>Whites having no direct authority</li>
<li>Slaves and free blacks</li>
<li>Slaves of same master</li>
<li>Closest slave friends</li>
<li>Immediate family</li>
</ol>


<p>With the first three being part of the public transcripts, the last three being part of the hidden ones, and the 4th straddling the two. In the public transcripts you are very much participating in the ritual order of society, but in the private ones you can break character into sincerity and talk about what's <em>actually</em> going on.</p>


<p>From this point of view, fundamentalist social orders can be thought of as access control in the ghost library: The idea that this secret body of knowledge is in some sense <em>immoral</em>, and that that which cannot be discussed in public should not be discussed at all.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Teach me of your human notions of love</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-15</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2y3eU3x">Finding Our Sea-Legs</a>, p 41:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it is not the oldest philosophical question in the book, but is one of the most recurrent, at least once puberty has kicked in: "What is this thing called love?"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Well, lets see what the book has to say about it. From Tiffany Watt Smith's <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lu4EEF">The Book of Human Emotions</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Is there anything left to say about love? Reams of poetry and songs, libraries' worth of philosophy, are dedicated to trying to express it, to understand and define it. The very volume of words tells us not only how much there is to say on the subject, but also how little can be said with any certainty.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Thanks Tiffany, that's very helpful.</p>


<p>Buckingham, on page 42, suggests that unlike philosophy (which asks questions like "What is love?"), storytelling tends to ask "What is love <em>like</em>?".</p>


<p>He is quick to point out the flaw in this question (on page 43):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Here, however, we need to be philosophically cautious. The way that this second question is phrased, "What is love like?" risks seducing us into thinking that there <em>is</em> in fact, a single thing, love, towards which this new question will lead us. But the more we ask this kind of question, the more it becomes apparent that love is no more a single thing than is death. What emerges from our storytelling is not Love, but a multiplicity of loves.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This multiplicity of loves is, I think, part of the core of the practical problems of love. In reality, we are not so much interested in the question "What is love like?" any more than we are interested in the question "What is love?". What we want to know tends to be questions more like:</p>


<ul>
<li>Do they love me?</li>
<li>Do I love them?</li>
<li>How do I find someone who will love me?</li>
<li>How do I love myself?</li>
</ul>


<p>I think we will find that when we ask these questions they will not always mean the the same notion of love.</p>


<p>Love, like most things, doesn't really have a formal definition - you can look it up in a dictionary, but dictionaries describe use rather than providing authoritative definitions, and the dictionary's selection of meanings for love are particularly useless.</p>


<p>Most words used in practice are defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostensive_definition">ostensively</a>, meaning that we point to a bunch of examples and hope that you can figure out the general pattern because we sure as hell don't know how explain it to you.</p>


<p>This is particularly tricky for things which are primarily phenomenological - purely or predominantly aspects of our subjective experience. We barely have a coherent vocabulary for talking about <em>pain</em>, and pain is at least relatively easy to reproduce on demand. How is this supposed to work for things like love, which are vastly more complicated, and which you cannot easily point to an example?</p>


<p>Buckingham's answer is to let go of the question and embrace this plurality. I think this concedes too much, because it runs into a substantial problem: We can <em>disagree</em> what love is.</p>


<p>I've talked about Bell Hooks's notion of love as "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of one's own or another's spiritual growth". I think this is a <em>good</em> definition. It's not true, in that I don't think one can meaningfully assign a truth value to the question of whether that is what love <em>is</em>, but I think that it provides a good starting point for reasoning about many of the positive aspects of love.</p>


<p>But it's certainly not a definition that everyone can agree on.</p>


<p>David Chapman talks about <a href="https://meaningness.com/nebulosity">nebulosity</a>, the cloudlike nature of things - clouds are ill defined at the boundary. If you ask "What is the weight of a cloud?" you will end up with uncertainty that is in some sense fundamentally ontological (concerned with categories - which bits of matter do you consider "part of the cloud"?) rather than epistemic (concerned with knowledge - trying to pin down facts of empirical reality). Some parts of reality are clearly part of the cloud, some parts of reality are clearly not part of the cloud, but at the boundary there is a region where it's... kinda part of the cloud but it's not really clear, and the answer to your question about the mass of the cloud will depend on how we decide that question of categorisation.</p>


<p>When you ask "Do I love them?" you will experience this nebulosity of love: Some people the answer is obviously no, hopefully some people the answer is obviously yes, but if you are asking the question you are probably in that boundary zone where the answer is the rather frustating "It depends what you mean by love?".</p>


<p>But when you ask "Do they love me?" the question is more complicated yet.</p>


<p>Not everyone has the same notion of love. Some notions of love are different, and some notions of love are better than others (there's no total ordering here - it's <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html">very unlikely that there's a single best notion of love</a>). Many notions of love that we see in common use are coercive, abusive, or proprietary. "I would love you more if you changed to be what I want", "I hurt you because I love you", or "I love you, so you are mine".</p>


<p>In those cases the difficulty is still one of ontology. There are still questions about where the boundary of love is, but that boundary is now not merely fuzzy but contested. This is no longer a collaboration where you are trying to pin down an area of uncertainty, but a fight over the correct positioning of that boundary.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Joy in Sadness</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2T377tI">A Field Guide to Getting Lost</a>, pages 118-119:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>There is a voluptuous pleasure in all that sadness, and I wonder where it comes from, because as we usually construe the world, sadness and pleasure should be far apart. Is it that the joy that comes from other people always risks sadness, because even when love doesn't fail, mortality enters in; is it that there is a place where sadness and joy are not distinct, where all emotion lies together, a sort of ocean into which the tributary streams of distinct emotions go, a faraway deep inside; is it that such sadness is only the side effect of art that describes the depths of our lives, and to see that described in all its potential for loneliness and pain is beautiful? There are songs of insurgent power; they are essentially what rock and roll, an outgrowth of one strain of the blues, does best, these songs of being young and at the beginning of the world, full of a sense of your own potential. Country, at least the old stuff, has mostly been devoted instead to aftermath, to the hard work it takes to keep going or the awareness that comes after it is no longer possible to go on. If it is deeper than rock it is because failure is deeper than success. Failure is what we learn from, mostly.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I find that I am reluctant to write about this passage, partly because I do not fully understand it.</p>


<p>Is there pleasure in sadness? Well, there can be of course. That which grounds you in your body is often easy to experience as pleasurable, at least until it becomes too intense, or you become bored of it, and you dissociate in order to numb yourself away from it. Feelings are experienced bodily, so can be a source of pleasure, even when those feelings are sadness - they connect you up with yourself, and you can revel in that connection.</p>


<p>But joy? I don't know. Sadness and joy <em>do</em> seem opposed to me.</p>


<p>Perhaps the problem is that I don't really know what joy is.
I've been trying to figure out how to expand my positive emotional range, and this lack of understanding of joy is part of that.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/3bqscos">The Book of Human Emotions</a>, Tiffany Watt Smith cites Spinoza:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Believing the stories of our lives were fundamentally beyond our control, Spinoza linked joyfulness to the accidental and unforeseen. It surges up when something is better than we can possibly have imagined. "Joy is pleasure accompanied by the idea of something past, which has had an issue <em>beyond our hope</em>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So perhaps there <em>can</em> be a joy in sadness. We are bad at self-reflection, and an upswelling of sadness (if we do not ignore it) grounds us, shows us an aspect of who we are that we didn't know was there. Accompanied with the pleasure of being grounded in ourself, it's like the sudden appearance of an old friend. A joyous greeting ensues: "Hello, what are you doing here? I didn't expect to see you here at at all."</p>


<p>But certainly not all sadness prompts joy, as I think we are collectively discovering in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/avyfain/status/1260832192030097409">Avy observed the following earlier today</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Mindfulness is all about being fully present, and not letting your mind slip into thinking about past or future. It feels good.</p>
<p>At the same time, months of isolation have been all about the right now. Living in an infinite present is awful.</p>
<p>Not sure how to reconcile this.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this reading of joy has something to add here.</p>


<p>Mindfulness can definitely be experienced as pleasure - I do, and honestly it's usually a bit too much for me to handle for more than short periods of time - but fundamentally undifferentiated pleasure is <em>boring</em>.</p>


<p>You can see this when you use attention to turn off pain.</p>


<p>The next time you're experiencing pain, focus your attention on it. You can often turn it off, or reframe it as interesting and enjoyable (whether this works is somewhat variable. For example I can't do this with headaches). But how long will you last doing it? If you're like me, lasting more than scant minutes is impossible - at some point the pain becomes preferable to the boredom.</p>


<p>Perhaps this is a lack of skill, and once one is at the point where one can sustain a two hour seated meditation, the boredom is entirely manageable, or perhaps even the boredom can be experienced as pleasurable. I don't know. Meditation is not among my skills.</p>


<p>But I suspect most people lack the skill to reframe boredom as pleasurable.</p>


<p>If joy is pleasure in the unexpected, then it is no surprise that mindfulness can bring joy in a way that the eternal now of pandemic time cannot, because mindfulness comes with a suspension of judgement that we, for the most part, cannot manage all the time.</p>


<p><a href="https://meaningness.com/wonder">David Chapman recently wrote about wonder</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I suggest that wonder occurs in heightened agendaless attention combined with suspension of habitual interpretation. Heightened agendaless attention allows and perceives unexpected patterning; suspension of habitual interpretation allows and perceives unexpected nebulosity.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(<a href="https://meaningness.com/nebulosity">nebulosity</a> is a term he uses in a technical sense idiosyncratic to his meaningness project. Nebulosity is the property of things that seem well defined to become vague at their boundaries)</p>


<p>I propose that this suspension of habitual interpretation is also one of the key differences between mindfulness and pandemic time. We experience joy because we are able to put aside, for a moment, our interpretation and thus our understanding, so whatever comes next will be equally surprising.</p>


<p>In the pandemic we are not able to do that, partly because we are not able to maintain this suspension for long periods of time anyway, and partly because it is <em>hard</em> to suspend interpretation when we are under threat.
Interpretation is a key part of our threat assessment and merely <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">knowing</a> that doesn't help us feel safe enough to do it.</p>


<p>And without this suspension of interpretation, without the perpetual surprise that comes with it, an eternal now is not a joyous experience. We experience only the sadness, without the ability to joyously revel in it, because we <em>know</em> what is there, and we are bored of it.</p>


<p>And without that joy, the eternal now takes a darker turn, because although an eternal now is experienced in mindfulness, it is also a symptom of depression.</p>


<p>I've <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html">written before</a> about Matthew Ratcliffe's book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3fJk71w">Experiences of Depression</a>, and his notion of <em>existential feelings</em> - feelings which lack an aboutness, but are instead part of the background structure of our experience of reality. Feelings associated with the passage of time are a significant type of existential feeling.</p>


<p>Ratcliffe proposes that much of the depressive experience can be thought of as disruption to existential feelings. Given that, it's not surprising that we can experience the disruption to the passage of time as depression. Also, for those of us already prone to depression, I suspect that some disruption to existential feelings can prompt a broader depressive episode, through trained associations and kicking off feedback loops that drive us deeper into this depression.</p>


<p>What defines the difference between whether a disruption to the passage of time causes depression or joy?</p>


<p>I suspect part of it is <em>agency</em>. In mindfulness, we are in a situation which we can choose to end whenever we need to. We have voluntarily entered into that state. It's a weird, inverted, image of the difference between a rollercoaster and a genuine threat: Because we are there voluntarily, the experience of the fear is qualitatively different even when the level of fear may be the same. Because we have chosen to suspend our experience of time, we can maintain an open curiousity, and can experience that disruption as joyous.</p>


<p>What does all this mean?</p>


<p>Well, it suggests at least three routes for dealing with the eternal now.</p>


<p>The first is that we can end it. We can take steps to texture time for ourselves. I've been working on this a bit recently and so far my experience is that it's good but also doesn't work. Previously I was living day to day, now I'm living week to week. The world is textured but still small.</p>


<p>The second is that we can cultivate agency without the eternal now. We may not be able to deal with it, but we can start projects, we can control that which we have access to. I think many people are taking this route.</p>


<p>The third, which is hardest and I barely know where to start, but ultimately may be the only option that works, is that we can try to learn to take joy in it. We can practice curiousity, reconcile ourselves to the endlessness in all of it, and try to explore the details of the world that is available to us. Maybe we'll be surprised by what we find there.</p>
