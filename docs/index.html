<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3fiWsnC">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, page 355:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>However, in London, where the Ministers knew as little of ships and seamanship as Strange, only one thing was clear: Strange had saved a ship, the loss of which would have cost the admiralty a vast amount of money.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In context, Strange has just saved a ship that had beached using magic. The magic in question resulted in completely reconfiguring the sandbeds of the harbour, which now have to be remapped. So, although he has solved the proximate problem, he has created a different one. This different problem is not necessarily a better one to have than the loss of the ship. </p>


<p>It's not necessarily a <em>worse</em> one either. The two are <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html">incommensurable</a>, and which problem is preferable to have depends on who you ask.</p>


<p>However, solving the problem is very good for Strange's career because the problem he replaced it with is:</p>


<ol>
<li>Less visible.</li>
<li>Requires a certain amount of expertise to understand.</li>
<li>Not the direct concern of the people with power.</li>
</ol>


<p>Strange has solved the problem by replacing it with one that matters less to people who matter and more to people don't matter, which is often a winning (if selfish) move.</p>


<p>I'm put in mind of <a href="https://blog.jaibot.com/the-copenhagen-interpretation-of-ethics/">the Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics</a>, where we punish people for improving the situation in suboptimal ways more than we punish them for not doing anything about it at all. I disagree with a lot of the examples in the linked post, but it still feels like there is something to the concept.</p>


<p>I wonder if this sort of problem is part of why we do that, and whether this is a rational thing to do after all: If we let people just swan in and "help", they will often do so in a way that is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html">legible</a> to people who are not experts in what the actual problems are - partly because they themselves are not experts, partly because the audience who matters to them are not the people with the problems but the people watching whose opinions they actually care about. Punishing showy but suboptimal displays of helping by outsiders may result in strictly less help, but it might be worth it if it causes the people who <em>do</em> help to actually consult with people on the ground and ask what they really need.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Morality tests as self-fulfilling prophecies</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>

</dl>


<p>Suppose someone is making a bad argument for a political point that you basically agree with.
Do you correct their argument?</p>


<p>Probably not. Because if you correct their argument, you will be treated as if you disagree with their conclusion.</p>


<p>This is not wrong of them per se: Almost everybody who corrects an argument does so because they disagree with the conclusion.</p>


<p>Why is that the case?</p>


<p>Well, because if you correct the argument you will be treated as disagreeing with the conclusion, which is rarely worth it unless you actually disagree with the conclusion, particularly in politics where disagreeing with the conclusion will usually be treated as a sign that you are a <em>bad person</em>.</p>


<p>This seems a little self-referential (A because B because A because B because...) but in fact it's a very straightforward feedback loop.</p>


<p>If you <em>do</em> disagree with the conclusion, it is worth correcting the argument. Therefore there is a core population of people who will always (yes this is a simplification. This is a toy model. Deal with it) correct the argument.</p>


<p>Suppose about 50% of the population disagree with the conclusion, and initially the other 50% are all happy to. So if someone disagrees with your argument there's a 50% chance that they're a bad person. That's a reasonable chance, but it's not conclusive by any means. It creates a suspicion at best.</p>


<p>But now everyone who corrects an argument has to do a certain amount of work to pass the morality test: To demonstrate that they're not a bad person. Initially it's not much - "Look, obviously (conclusion), but I don't think this is the right reasoning because (correction). Instead (alternative)" will easily clear the bar.</p>


<p>But that's still a nontrivial amount of work. Say about 20% of the population who agree with the conclusion (i.e. 10% of the total population) just don't care enough to do the work. Now what you have is that 50% of the population will argue with you because they disagree with the conclusion, and 40% of the population will argue with you because they agree with the conclusion and disagree with the argument. Now, \(\frac{5}{9} \approx 56\%\) of people who disagree with your argument are bad people.
This increases the level of suspicion, and thus the level of work required to pass the morality test, and so slightly more people drop out.
Over time, thanks to this feedback loop, increasingly people only disagree with your argument if they also disagree with your conclusion <em>or</em> if they are prepared to put in a huge (in some cases impossible) amount of effort to call you on your bad argument.</p>


<p>In this way the prediction (if you disagree with my argument you may be a bad person) has turned into a norm (only bad people disagree with my argument).</p>


<p>I don't know about you, but I hate this. I am extremely in favour of knowing true things, and making sure arguments are correct is a part of that. If my argument is wrong I usually <em>want</em> to know (although I'll admit that this doesn't mean that I accept correction gracefully all the time, especially if it comes from strangers, especially especially if it comes from strangers on Hacker News). This norm essentially means that I cannot trust anybody's arguments to be reliably truth tracking.</p>


<p>I also hate it more because this pattern repeats over and over again. It's one of the driving factors of political polarisation - if you disagree with me on one political issue, that's evidence that you disagree with me on all the others (and thus are a bad person) etc. In general, people are not allowed to agree with the outgroup on anything, because that is treated as evidence that they are a member of the outgroup.</p>


<p>I would like to fix these feedback loops.</p>


<p>I think for public discourse with strangers we're basically fucked, and there's no way to fix them right now except to set up much harder boundaries. The best we can do hope to do in most of these cases right now is to deescalate - politely rebuff people instead of shouting at them. It won't fix the problem but it might ease off on accelerating it a bit.</p>


<p>But I do think we can do better with people we know, and I think this starts by accepting more of the burden of proof: If we suspect someone we know, especially a friend, of being a bad person, we should give them the benefit of the doubt. This doesn't require us to make excuses for them, but it does require us to be willing to do the work ourselves to figure out what's going on rather than immediately leaping to conclusions.</p>


<p>In order to get the ball rolling on that I will make the following prediction: if you're <em>not</em> willing to do that, chances are you're a bad friend.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Losing the story for the style</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-11</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2LYdFGs">100 Ways to Improve your Writing</a> by Gary Provost, page 57:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>There is no subject that cannot be made fascinating by a well-informed and competent writer. And there is no subject that cannot be quickly turned into a literary sleeping pill by an incompetent writer.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(This is as part of a section on style)</p>


<p>This isn't true, and the fact that Provost thinks it's true is heavily informed by sorts of things he writes about,
which tend to be of more general interest.</p>


<p>Part of the problem is that fascination is a question of audience/writing fit. In a similar way that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-08-08:53.html">you can't teach everything to a layperson</a>, you cannot fascinate someone who refuses to be fascinated,
and some people are just never going to be fascinated by some subjects, and you may well need to write about those subjects (possibly because of the people who <em>are</em> going to be fascinated by it!).</p>


<p>It's true that there is a fascinating story to be told about most subjects for most people, but often you shouldn't tell that one because it's not the important bit.
This reminds me of Zinsser's fucking terrible advice to tell a story about your engagement with the subject matter rather than the subject matter itself. There are circumstances under which that is the right thing to do, but those circumstances require me to care about you personally rather than the thing that I was expecting to learn.</p>


<p>It's certainly true that any story can be told in a way that fascinates the maximum number of people who are capable of being fascinated by it, and that style has a huge part to play in that.
I'm in favour of good writing style, of course I am, and of not writing in a style that bores your audience, but it's important to not overstate the importance of style: You can't <em>make</em> people fascinated by your writing, except by writing about a subject that they will be fascinated by when properly told, and sometimes that's not the subject you're there to write about.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Don't anthropomorphise fate, it hates that</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-10</dd>
</dl>


<p>From Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Fate. Fates, the: The Greeks and Romans supposed there were three Parcae or Fates, who arbitrarily controlled the birth, life and death of everyone. They were CLOTHO, LACHESIS and ATROPOS. They are sometimes called the 'cruel Fates' because they paid no head to anyone's wishes.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Looking up each of these individually:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Atropos (Greek, 'not turning', 'unchangeable'). In Greek mythology the eldest of the three FATES, the the one who severs the thread of life.</p>
<p>Clotho (Greek klothein, 'to draw thread', 'to spin'). One of the three FATES in classic mythology. She presided over birth and drew from her distaff the thread of life. (See also Atropos, Lachesis)</p>
<p>Lachesis. One of the three FATES, and the one who spins life's thread and determines its length. Her name represents Greek <em>lakhesis</em>, 'destiny'</p>
</blockquote>


<p>One thing I notice is how utterly inconsistent the formatting is on the three fates. Only Clotho references the other two. Lachesis has a different formatting for the Greek representation of her name.
That's by the by though.</p>


<p>(By the by. Incidentally. 'By-' can often denote something subsidiary or secondary, such as: by-election, an election in a single constituency; by-play, the secondary action in a play; by-product, a subsidiary product; and byroad, a minor road)</p>


<p>I've talked about <a href="https://amzn.to/2TCbsoa">Random Justice</a> before (e.g. in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-23-07:48.html">Proportionality and identity</a>), and about its point that one of the problems with lotteries for decision making is that they are a bit too arbitrary and impersonal in their fairness.</p>


<p>I still haven't got around to reading The Secret of our Success but reviews of it (e.g. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/">Scott Alexander's review</a> and <a href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html">Scholar's Stage's review</a>) exposed me to its idea that one of the historic functions of divination is to introduce randomisation into your decision making, and the personification of it as a message from the gods was part of how you got over the unfairness of it.</p>


<p>Given that, it's interesting (if not entirely surprising) that the personifications of chance are the <em>cruel</em> fates,
who you can't argue with.</p>


<p>It seems like often one of the ways we deal with things is to personify them - treat them as an actual person. This works varyingly well. Sometimes it drives you to do useful activities like divination, where the reason it works is unrelated to the claimed purpose driven by that personification, but sometimes is causes you to treat objective reality as if it could be argued with, and that doesn't work out so great.</p>


<p>"Facts don't care about your feelings" is a bad meme because facts are socially constructed statements about the underlying reality. But it's true that the underlying reality does not, necessarily, care much what you think of it - a volcano is going to erupt no matter what you sacrifice to it, a pandemic is going to pandemic regardless of whether you're bored of it.</p>


<p>I think part of the problem is that we're used to the giant impersonal powers that control our fates being made out of people. Politics, capitalism, etc. aren't necessarily any less prone to crushing us with utter indifference to our lives, but that's because it feels like that's because the people involved in those systems <em>don't</em> care. They could, in principle, be made to care if we exerted enough power over them (e.g. via protest). Whether or not that caring would result in systemic change is a bit more of a question mark, but the possibility is at least there.</p>


<p>A natural disaster has no such potential to care. Yellowstone could erupt tomorrow killing us all, and it really doesn't matter how problematic we think that is.</p>


<p>The temptation to personify is still there, and I think as long as we don't take it too seriously it's probably fine and maybe useful (omg coronachan is so mean), but it's important to remember: Fate is not cruel, fate is not kind, she isn't a person at all. The fates don't care about your feelings.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A Book is a Tool for Thinking With</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-09</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew">Talking About Machines</a> by Julian Orr, page 106:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>...documentation is not just a representation of the machine and its prescriptions but must be regarded as a mechanism in and of itself. A service manual is a device which someone constructs to convey information to someone else, and choices of inclusion and exclusion significantly constrain what can be done with the manual.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this is an underappreciated point, especially when writing technical documentation, but I would go further than this: A document is not just a device for conveying information, it is a tool for thinking with.</p>


<p>You can see this in, well, the current post where I'm using <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html">the random book prompt I described before</a> (although I actually picked page 107 and scanned backwards for context and found this passage was the one that I wanted to write about).
The random prompt isn't really "conveying information" per se (I've already read this passage and am already aware of the general theme), but I am using the book as a way to have thoughts that I wouldn't otherwise have had, by picking a random passage from it and writing about it, which causes me to have thoughts that I would not otherwise have been having.</p>


<p>As I talked about in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-13-09:56.html">How to read a book</a>, the actual physical design of the tool (the book) matters quite significantly for its use. If you just think of it as a document for conveying information, the information is all that matters, but the physical design constrains its usage. <a href="https://ramble.rixx.de/2020/06/08/a-blog-upon-the-deep.html">As Tobi discovered yesterday</a>, if all you've got is a library of ebooks you're significantly constrained in your ability to pick random passages from it (unless you create your own programmatic tooling on top).</p>


<p>Over the next few pages, Orr talks about the corporation's use of "directive documentation" - documentation which goes through explicit procedures that you are supposed to follow exactly in the course of debugging the (photocopier) machine:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The directive documentation is designed not to provide information for thinking about the machine and its problems but to direct the technician to the solution through a minimal decision tree.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>He then goes on to explain how this doesn't really work, because reality is irreducibly messy. The technicians use the documentation anyway, because it is often the result of knowledge they don't have (e.g. about the specific workings of a specific machine), but they do so in their own way:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>...a system that fixes the machine without either customer or technician knowing how or why is unlikely to be acceptable. Consequently, when the technicians use the directive documentation, they try to determine the purpose of the various tests, to understand what the documentation is testing, to know what they are doing.</p>
<p>This is not done just so they can reassure the customer; the technicians are also developing their understanding for future problems.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As I keep saying <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">the fastest way to learn something is to do something</a>, but often you run into the problem is that you have no idea what to do in order to learn something. Working through a preset procedure is often a good way to go.</p>


<p>A lot of people were complaining at me recently because I had the audacity to suggest that you could learn programming from books. Obviously you learn programming from doing programming, and the idea of learning programming from books is ridiculous (except for all of these books that are <em>not</em> about programming that you should read to become a better programmer, because apparently it's perfectly possible to learn about programming by reading as long as you pretend you're not doing that).</p>


<p>I suggest that one reason why people think this is that they are using books wrong. They have this wrong-headed idea that the way a book is supposed to work is that you read the book, you now have the book's information, and you now know the subject. Because this is not possible with programming (you <em>do</em> have to program to learn to program, there really is no way around that), it must be impossible to learn programming from a book.</p>


<p>This is, of course, obviously nonsense, because this is a fully general argument against learning <em>anything</em> from a book. Everything you learn has to be actively engaged with in order to learn it - even books which are pure information content you still need a much more active process of learning than that or the information will mostly disappear from your brain as soon as it enters, leaving only a vague sense that there's a there there (which is still useful of course - this is a form of <a href="https://jmestn.com/15485/naval-doesn-t-take-notes">reading to maximize your exposure to ideas</a>).</p>


<p>Instead, books about programming (or any other subject) should be thought of as tools you can use as part of your learning process. Just reading a book won't help you any more than thoroughly learning the details of a hammer will. You have to actually hit things with it. </p>
