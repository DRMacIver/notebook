<p class="subtitle">Good strategies often fail</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-19</dd>

<p>I <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/02/you-should-be-stockpiling-food-for-brexit/">stockpiled food for Brexit</a>. A lot of people were skeptical of me for that, and many people have said that the way Brexit played out proved me wrong and that it was an overreaction.</p>


<p>They are wrong and I was right. Stockpiling food for Brexit and not needing it was the expected outcome. It was never something that I thought I was likely to need, it was a capacity I was building in case of a low probability high cost event. The logic was that either food stockpiling wouldn't be useful, in which case I had a surplus to use up, or it would be kinda useful in which case it was a net positive, or it would be essential, in which case I would be incredibly glad I had it.</p>


<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3926VQH">Annie Duke</a> calls this fallacy <em>resulting</em>, and I think it's a rare instance of something escaping <a href="https://maartenboudry.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-fallacy-fork-why-its-time-to-get.html">the fallacy fork</a>.
Resulting is the fallacy of assuming that because you got a bad outcome you must have made a bad choice, when in fact you might just have got a bad outcome because you picked the option with a 60% chance of success instead of a 40% chance but it turns out that you're in the 40% chance world. Chance means that you can never perfectly control the outcome, and you should be careful not to let random chance inform your learning too much.</p>


<p>More complicated is that often good strategies you'll never even know if you succeeded or not. A lot of mitigations for COVID-19 are like this: You'll never know whether it really mattered that you were washing your hands, or socially isolating, because all you're doing is stacking the odds on a numbers game. You might get the virus anyway, or you might have never got the virus, there's no way to know. It's still a good strategy.</p>


<p>Capacity building strategies in particular are often a good idea, because they can be useful in unexpected ways.
I didn't immediately dismantle my Brexit stockpile when it seemed unlikely that we'd need it, I've just been using it as a buffer, so now if we do end up on pandemic lockdown we'll be well placed for food supplies while self isolating.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Safety as an enabler of growth</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-18</dd>
</dl>


<p>My friend Alex Chan <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2020/03/rich-enough-to-make-bad-choices/">recently wrote about how one of the big advantages of being rich is that the rich can afford to make risky investments</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Being rich gives you a safety net to make bad investments, which helps you find more good ones. Over time, the rich don’t just spend less money, they find new ways to earn more money. In terms Samuel Vimes would understand: they don’t just invest in a pair of sturdy boots, they invest in experimental boot-making startups.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As Alex points out, this ties in to my argument that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-22-11:37.html">you should try bad things</a>.
You can only try bad things if you have the resources to ensure that failure is no big deal.</p>


<p>For some bad things, this isn't an issue, but for things which have a relatively high cost (financial, time, or otherwise), being poor (or even just not rich!) blocks them off from you.
This is particularly egregious in the examples that Alex points out, where the lack of financial security is the very thing that prevents you from gaining more financial security.</p>


<p>This is a general pattern that repeats in many other contexts.
In order to grow, it needs to be safe to try things, and lacking the thing that you want to grow is what makes it unsafe.</p>


<p>This is often connected with learning. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">The fastest way to learn something is to do something</a>, but if doing something can go catastrophically wrong then you're not going to risk it, so whole avenues of learning are blocked off for you.</p>


<p>As well as financial, two common places this occurs are social and emotional safety (which can be tightly connected, but also can fail independently in their own way).
There's all the literature on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety">psychological safety</a> about how feeling safe in your team is an enabler of success, because people are more able to propose ideas and learn from them.
This ties in to what I was saying yesterday about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html">permission</a>: One of the key features of psychological safety in a group environment is the way it gives you permission to experiment and try things that might not work.</p>


<p>Another type of safety is <em>emotional</em> safety. For a lot of us the insides of our own heads are not safe. As I wrote about in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/01/a-crash-course-in-having-feelings/">a crash course in having feelings</a>, one of the key steps to emotional growth is getting to a point where you can have feelings (especially negative ones) without being overwhelmed by them. As long as your feelings are dangerous to you, it's impossible to experiment with and learn about them, and this stops you from growing emotionally.</p>


<p>There are a couple of insidious traps that one can fall into that can make an otherwise safe situation unsafe:</p>


<ul>
<li>Overidentification with success. You see this a lot with smart people and learning. If failure is an indication that you are not smart, because a smart person would have succeeded at this, and you strongly identify with being smart, you will often struggle to learn because anything that fails is a direct attack on your self-identity.</li>
<li>Success as implying commitment. By doing something, you have demonstrated that you are able to do it, and now in future you can be coerced or pressured into doing it.</li>
</ul>


<p>In both of these cases, the cost of trying things is raised considerably: In the first, the cost of failure is made much worse. In the second, success itself becomes the costly thing. Either way, you have found yourself in an environment where trying things cannot be safe, because success has become too high stakes.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Everybody is looking for permission</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-17</dd>
</dl>


<p>A lens I started looking at the social world through a while back is <em>permission</em>.
Specifically, that everybody is looking for it, and that many situations, relationships, and activities can be thought of in terms of what permission they give you.</p>


<p>A common, practical, example of this is asking stupid questions in meetings: Often everybody is confused, but nobody feels they have permission to ask, so once somebody is prepared to break the silence everyone is more able to (although a friend has expressed concern that asking stupid questions has instead become high status as people have learned this).</p>


<p>Another example that has been very relevant recently is giving people permission to freak out about COVID-19. I think at this point everyone has officially been given that permission, so it's no longer quite so useful (that may be more local / political. Certainly some people <em>aren't</em> freaking out about it, and I suspect some of their friends still need permission), but there was a period of a few weeks where it was a bit more controversial to do so and people were fairly actively saying "Look, this is a thing I am worried about, it's OK to be worried about it".</p>


<p>In general, <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/06/on-not-quite-fitting/">everyone is a bit worried about being weird</a>, and despite these worries being widespread, a mix of everyone being weird in different ways and pluralistic ignorance (the majority privately reject a norm that the majority publicly enforce), and needs permission to break out of the norms that society has imposed on them.</p>


<p>The problem is that permission often needs to be a lot stronger than just providing an example, or telling someone it's OK. They don't necessarily believe you, or even if they do believe you they've <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">internalised societal norms too much</a>.
Frequently mere verbal permission will be met with active opposition.</p>


<p>Again, pluralistic ignorance is a good example of this: Suppose most straight people are just not that fussed about heterosexuality (I think this is actually pretty likely, but if you disagree pretend it's a thought experiment). It's not that they're gay, or even that they're particularly bi, but they're open to the idea in principle and don't really see what all the fuss is about. However, if there are very strong norms enforcing it, these more-or-less-heterosexual straight people will probably enforce those norms <em>harder</em> for fear of being caught on the wrong end of them. So you can't just straightforwardly give them permission, you need some way of committing to it. If they've sufficiently internalised the norms, it might not even be possible to give them permission, because the thing withholding permission is their own shame and the only person who can give them that permission is themself.</p>


<p>I think a lot of circumstances end up implicitly granting permission by making the action "playing the game". For example, people behave very differently when drunk, but a lot of this isn't actually because alcohol, it's because the fact that you're drunk gives you permission to behave like a drunk person. You see this with things like stag parties, hen does, etc. where people are given permission by the format to behave like complete asses in ways they normally wouldn't do.</p>


<p>I think this is also why a lot of "mandatory fun" fails: There is a certain sort of permission that you need to behave like a person in a fun situation, and often mandatory fun skips the "foreplay" element that is needed to provide that permission, so people end up in a situation where people are being expected to behave in a way that they do not feel they have permission to.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Berkson's paradox is everywhere</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-15</dd>
</dl>


<p>Everyone likes to tell you that correlation is not causation. They're right, but they're also boring. Also <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2014/05/spurious-correlations-and-causation/">all of their examples are wrong</a>.</p>


<p>What they don't tell you about so often is the most common reason why correlation does not imply correlation is that most of the correlations you see in day to day life are, in some sense, fake: They are not present in the underlying reality, they're an artifact of how you're looking at it. This is <em>Berkson's paradox</em>.</p>


<p>My go to example of this (I don't actually know if it's true, but it's a nice illustration) is that professional tennis players tend to be either tall or fast - tall tennis players tend to be slower, fast tennis players tend to be shorter.</p>


<p>You could come up with some complicated biological explanation about why these two traits might be negatively correlated, but it would be wrong, because they're not negatively correlated in the general population, or at least not to the same degree. The reason is much simpler than that: Short, slow, people will rarely play tennis professionally.</p>


<p>As a result, if height and speed are entirely independent of eachother (even if they're slightly positively correlated!) when you look at professional tennis players they will become negatively correlated, because it's more likely to be one or the other than it is to be both.</p>


<p>This may seem like a weird niche edge case, but once you start noticing it it's <em>everywhere</em>.</p>


<p>For example, you know how popular things are often kinda bad and the really good things are niche? Is that true, or is it just that you don't notice things that are bad and unpopular?</p>


<p>You know how people who disagree with you seem kinda shouty? Do you notice people who disagree with you and are not shouty?</p>


<p>This repeats over and over again: The patterns we see in day to day life come as much from the process that causes us to observe the data as it does from any underlying causal mechanism.</p>


<p>Does this matter? I think it does, for two reasons:</p>


<ol>
<li>As with "correlation does not imply causation" in general, we need to be careful about letting the inferences we draw suggest actions unless we understand what the actual causal mechanism is.</li>
<li>Because these correlations come from the process rather than reality, if the process changes then many of our old inferences become invalid.</li>
</ol>


<p>(2) is particularly important when we experience <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">culture shifts</a>, because the entire generating process will have changed, so many things we thought were true become invalid.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Alief/Belief Coherence</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>Let me start with a word: Alief. An Alief is like a belief, but instead of it being something you <em>think</em> is true it's something you <em>feel</em> is true (it's a pun you see - a-liefs come before b-liefs).</p>


<p>Alief is a very good word that I use a lot. If you don't have it yet, you're welcome, because you'll see it everywhere now.</p>


<p>It's particularly interesting to notice where your aliefs and beliefs diverge. Sometimes you believe things but you don't alieve them (e.g. you might know you are good at your job but experience impostor syndrome anyway), sometimes you alieve things but you don't believe them (you might think your friends secretly hate you).</p>


<p>As you might have noticed from those examples, it is often my experience that our beliefs are more functional than our aliefs.
This isn't always the case. For example you might get a weird vibe off someone and go "No I'm just being unfair" and try to ignore it, only to later discover that they are indeed a massive creep who you are better off ignoring.
You alieved that they were dangerous but you didn't believe it, and the belief let you astray.
Hunches and intuition in general are often like this - you might have no objective reason to believe that a particular direction is promising, but you've got a strong hunch (an alief) that it would be.</p>


<p>An alief is just a felt sense (in <a href="https://rivalvoices.substack.com/p/what-even-is-focusing-and-why-eugene">the Gendlin sense</a>) that something is true, but it's a felt sense that is usefully framed as being like a belief where you've just skipped over the surrounding propositional infrastructure.</p>


<p>One of the advantages of beliefs is that we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition">metacognition</a> to examine them. It's not actually true that we arrive at beliefs through simple propositional reasoning, but we're much more able to pretend that we are - we can put forth logical arguments for them, sometimes backfilling to construct ones where we realise we don't have them, etc.
Often once we attack a belief with metacognition we might find it degrades to an alief - we no longer think it's true, but we feel it's true.</p>


<p>As this process suggests, there isn't actually a clear distinction between aliefs and beliefs: Beliefs are formed on aliefs, aliefs are informed by beliefs, and the whole thing is really a much more complicated network of interplay between felt sense, explicit verbal thought, and action.</p>


<p>It is perhaps better to think of alief and belief as <em>directions</em> - the more your relationship to a proposition is built on felt sense, the more like an alief it is, the more it is built on explicit reasoning, the more like a belief it is, but the reality is that there are no pure aliefs and no pure beliefs, only things that are more or less each (note that alief and belief are not opposite directions, but orthogonal ones).</p>


<p>Regardless of how pure they are though, we will still run into situations where we find that what we <em>think</em> is true is in conflict with what we <em>feel</em> is true.
What do we do then?</p>


<p>A difficulty that people may have is that because they can explicitly work with beliefs through metacognition, they can update their beliefs relatively easily, but they have no such tools for updating their aliefs.
Thus in a conflict one of two things will happen: Their beliefs will change, or they will be stuck with unhelpful aliefs (which they believe to be false but cannot shake).</p>


<p>This is where tools like Focusing come in, allowing us to work better with the felt sense.</p>


<p>In this sense, things such as the tools I outlined in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">Emotional reactions as legacy code</a> can be thought of as the other half of the toolkit for ensuring coherence between your beliefs and your aliefs, bringing your aliefs into alignment with your beliefs when it is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-03-09:07.html">the feeling that is wrong and that needs to change</a>.</p>
