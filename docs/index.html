<p>(A short post today because I have run out of brain)</p>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3d3M3vs">Finding Our Sea-Legs</a> by Will Buckingham, page 69:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>If I were to travel to Japan and stand before Mount Fuji, I would do so not with an attentiveness born of bare seeing, but with an attentiveness made keen by my love of Hokusai's prints. I would see the mountain with the care and the love that comes from knowing it is precisely <em>this</em> mountain, and not some other, before which I stand.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This ties interestingly in to my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-26-06:22.html">previous post about visual hermeneutics</a>. Because Buckingham has prior context the mountain, that causes him to interpret it in a particular way - he feels certain things about it, but also he attends to it differently. He knows things about it, and his eye is trained to look for them.</p>


<p>I think we often have a broken intuitive model of how vision works. Vision is not actually us statically observing what is there. It is an active, engaged, process, where our eye looks for and tracks certain details. Your visual field is mostly incredibly blurry, outside of a very narrow range, but your eyes dart around picking out detail wherever you're paying attention to so you mostly don't notice.</p>


<p>This means that interpretation isn't just a matter of post-processing after you've seen an image, it determines where you focus your attention, so it literally changes what you see.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Defects are the responsibility of programmers</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-29</dd>
</dl>


<p>This post is an elaboration on a <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265967699743649793">Twitter thread about software I did yesterday</a>.</p>


<p>Hillel wrote <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/defects-are-not-the-fault-of-programmers/">Defects are not the fault of programmers</a>. It is a good post and I encourage you to read it.</p>


<p>In particular:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>No, the bigger issue with “programmers create defects” is an essential issue with the worldview. Its basis in facts is less important than its value as a “lens” we can use to understand defects. If we know where defects come from, we know what we need to do to manage them. To emphasize this: Our worldview on defects shapes our means of reducing defects. We measure the value of a lens by how useful it is.</p>
<p>So what does the “defects are the fault of programmers” worldview tell us about our means? It says that the only way to reduce defects is to improve programmer discipline. Either the programmer is sufficiently disciplined and nothing can cause defects, or the programmer is insufficiently disciplined and nothing can prevent defects. </p>
</blockquote>


<p>I'd like to argue that Hillel is mostly correct, but bugs should <em>also</em> be considered the fault of the programmers.</p>


<p>I'd also like to argue that the idea that bugs are the fault of the programmer, as implemented in practice, is in fact <em>much</em> worse than Hillel is making it out to be. The worst part of "defects are the fault of the programmer" is not that it doesn't help us to reduce defects, but that in fact that over time it virtually guarantees to increase them.</p>


<p>A software development process is not just there to produce software, it's also there to produce a software development team, and in order to understand the effect of any given process you need to consider its effect on both. Systems which have positive effects on the software while having negative effects on the team, will, in the long run (which often is not that long - a year or two if often more than enough) end up backfiring horribly on the software as well.</p>


<p>In particular, defects are a normal part of the software development process. People make mistakes, people misunderstand things. If you've never had a bug in production then that's probably because nobody is using your software or you spend <em>far</em> too long developing it.</p>


<p>So independently of the question of whose <em>fault</em> a defect is, the more important question is: When a defect occurs, does your software development team get better or worse?</p>


<p>I'd like to suggest that any system that relies <em>solely</em> on personal responsibility will get worse in response to bugs, but so will any system that treats bugs as not the programmer's fault.</p>


<p>Ideally we want people to take responsibility for shipping high quality software. The basic problem is:</p>


<ol>
<li>If people don't care about getting good results, there is no system that will get good results.</li>
<li>If people do care about getting good results, basically every system works well.</li>
<li>The system you choose determines which of these scenarios are stable states.</li>
</ol>


<p>In particular if a system <em>relies</em> on people caring about getting good results, in the absence of support for that, you will <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia">burn out the people who care the most</a>, they will stop caring and/or leave, and you will end up with a team that doesn't care about getting good results.</p>


<p>One of the easiest ways to create this dynamic is to have a culture of personal responsibility for defects while pressuring people to ship, and providing no collective support for what to do in the event of failure.
If you treat "defects are the programmer's fault" as your guiding correctness principle, you will end up with a team whose response to that is "Yeah, but who cares?".</p>


<p>But <em>also</em> if you treat defects as intrinsically not the programmer's fault, you do this. "Human error" is a bad attribution in that you can always find a human to blame, but "System error" is also a bad attribution because you can always find a system to blame. Humans in the system are what create performance as well as defects, and if you treat humans as <em>never</em> the problem, what you end up with is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14773996.2018.1491147?journalCode=tphs20">safety clutter</a> where people's hands are tied.
And, once again, people will tend to get frustrated ane leave. They won't necessarily be the same people as left in the other scenario, but having a team full of people who are entirely comfortable with plodding bureaucratic slowness at every step of the way is also not a great end state.
A key part of getting good results is that you have to get results.</p>


<p>I would suggest that a crucial part of getting to a system that creates a good team is that <em>guilt</em>. When something goes wrong, the person responsible should feel appropriately guilty.</p>


<p>The problem with this is that we are all very bad at guilt.</p>


<p>Yes, I can hear you thinking "Oh don't worry David, I'm <em>very</em> good at guilt". That is exactly the problem I am talking about.</p>


<p>Being good at guilt doesn't mean feeling a lot of guilt. It means feeling an appropriate amount of guilt, which can range from "Oops, my bad" to "Yeah that was a massive fuck up on my part. I'll make it right".</p>


<p>The problem we collectively have with guilt, both in terms of how we experience it and how we inflict it on others, is that we treat it as a binary with very little between no guilt and massive irredeemable shame. This is intrinsically unhealthy. Guilt, properly handled, is an acknowledgement that you have done badly and an impetus to do better. It cannot serve that function as we currently manage it.</p>


<p>The second crucial part of getting to a system that creates a good team is that "I'll make it right" part.
If people feel guilty but are <em>not</em> empowered to fix it, then you once again end up in the situation where everyone who cares burns out and/or leaves.</p>


<p>Sometimes that empowerment to make it right will consist of the programmer, as an individual, resolving and learning to do better. Sometimes it will be about changing the system. Sometimes they'll be able to manage it on their own, sometimes they'll need support.</p>


<p>There is, sadly, no universal prescription that works. The world is messy and complicated. But if you give people the support they need to do better, and create a system that tends to improve rather than degrade the moral, emotional, and professional skills of its members, and responds healthily to the normal trials and tribulations that the world has to throw at it, it will probably go pretty well for you.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Key Performance Indicators</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-28</dd>
</dl>


<p>TLDR: Drunk and more than slightly self-indulgent.</p>


<p>I have inspired <a href="https://twitter.com/captain_mrs/status/1266063855018532865">the creation of a blog</a> which is absolutely one of my victory conditions.</p>


<p>This caused me to think about some others.</p>


<ul>
<li>Every word I inspire someone to write.</li>
<li>Every time you curse my name.</li>
<li>Every comment by someone who is annoyed by my being right.</li>
<li>Every time my perfectly reasonable behaviour seems impossible to you.</li>
<li>Every time someone sends a link to my writing to their therapist.</li>
<li>Every time someone uses something I wrote to win an argument.</li>
<li>Every time I make someone happier for my presence.</li>
<li>But also every time someone understands themself better because of me.</li>
<li>Every time I change how you look at the world.</li>
<li>Every conversation we have that you thought was impossible.</li>
<li>Every person whose life I make better.</li>
</ul>


<p>Do these seems inadequately selfish to you? They do to me. We ground our values in the people around us, but if we don't <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/being-an-example-to-others/">learn to be a little bit selfish</a> then those values result in everyone being miserable through trying to make everyone happy.</p>


<p>Some of them are, perhaps, a little selfish, in that they allow me to embrace my inner villain,
but villains, too, are unselfish: We're the ones who want to change the world for the better.
The heroes are just there to maintain the status quo.</p>


<p>So what are my victory conditions for me?</p>


<ul>
<li>Every "Ah ha!" moment.</li>
<li>Every hug.</li>
<li>Every time I get to uncomplicatedly enjoy myself.</li>
<li>Every time I figure out why I can't, and fix that.</li>
<li>Every time I get to act with my whole self, without holding back.</li>
<li>Every (redacted).</li>
</ul>


<p>This doesn't seem enough. I can think of a few more, but I don't want to write them down,
and perhaps that's the problem: Admitting to wanting, let alone needing, things is vulnerable,
and I don't like being vulnerable.</p>


<p>This may seem surprising, as I share a lot, but what I share is in fact carefully curated. It doesn't count as vulnerability if by sharing it I rob it of its power, or if I do the work to become safe first.</p>


<p>Also, if I'm honest, I don't really feel like the ones for me count. They feel pointlessly self-indulgent, or like things I'm supposed to want to want. Where they don't the emotions don't feel exactly <em>good</em>. I feel like the emotion associated with healing and growth should be something akin to joy, but that's not quite how it feels. It's more like a "Ha ha! Fuck you! You can't beat <em>me</em>!". It's still other-oriented.</p>


<p>I've been spending the last year or two trying to work on emotional skills, and that's been pretty good. I liked the bit where I figured out how to turn off social anxiety. But a lot of the drive for that has been other oriented too: I started a relationship, I realised my emotional baggage was now someone else's problem, and it caused me to prioritise it.</p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265585499500089344">I suggested recently to Luli</a> that two good books about being selfish were "The Courage to be Disliked" and "Conflict is not Abuse". I feel it's kinda telling that both of my book recommendations about how to be selfish were about how to have healthier relationships with others.</p>


<p>I think perhaps the problem starts with how we conceptualise selfishness, and the idea of boundaries. Boundaries are things you put there to defend yourself. Defending yourself is good and proper and you have a right to do so,
so it's not hard to assert those rights. "You are hurting me. Stop." is not a complicated sentiment, and it's one that most healthy communities acknowledge a right to.</p>


<p>But "acting to minimize suffering at the hands of others" isn't the hard part for me. I've had a lot of training in that one I'm afraid.</p>


<p>The question is, what's next? Minimizing suffering doesn't lead to happiness, it just leads to non-suffering. Neutrality isn't that great. There's a reason "emotional blunting" is a diagnostic term.</p>


<p>I think part of why I <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-27-07:21.html">got quite so cranky at the inner game of tennis</a> is the idea that you can just turn off the verbal self and the embodied self will rise to the occasion because it's fundamentally fine. The embodied self <em>isn't</em> fine sometimes. Sometimes you need to coax it out of its shell.</p>


<p><a href="http://clarissalittler.github.io/2020/05/28/feelings-of-being-final.html">Clarissa wrote about horizonal damage earlier</a> and this feels fairly apt. My experience is different from theirs, but the space of the possible is constrained.
I can be selfish or unselfish in my interaction with others, but I can't really at present see how to be self-oriented.
I am aware of it as a theoretical possibility, but it does not appear as a practical orientation in the world that I can access.</p>


<p>I had some more thoguhts but it's late and I should go to bed before this gets even more angsty, so I'm going to leave it there.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Life is neither poker nor tennis</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-28</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3deDz4N">Thinking in Bets</a> by Annie Duke, page 10:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Hindsight bias is the tendency, after an outcome is known, to see the outcome as having been inevitable. When we say "I should have known that would happen," or, "I should have seen it coming," we are succumbing to hindsight bias.</p>
<p>Those beliefs develop from an overly tight connection between outcomes and decisions. That is typical of how we evaluate our past decisions."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is from a chapter called "Life is poker, not chess."</p>


<p>Before I start, I'd like to say that I think "Thinking in Bets" is a very good book and I would recommend that most people read it. It is probably the most accessible practical manual of rationality that I know of (there may well be better ones, but I don't know of them), and most people's thinking would be improved by a good primer in that.</p>


<p>Which is why I now want to explain why it's also wrong about everything.</p>


<p>In discussions on Twitter about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-27-07:21.html">yesterday's diatribe against The Inner Game of Tennis</a>, I made <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265765964915904514">the following point</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The problem being that because he got his start in tennis where verbal intelligence mostly <em>does</em> need to get out of the way, and because most people don't have tennis-related trauma, his model works pretty there but has fatal flaws when you try to generalise it off the court.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Gallwey is making a classic error: He is a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">nerd</a>, and he thinks his special interest is universally applicable. Most of the advice in the inner game of tennis is very good <em>if you only ever apply it on the Tennis court</em>.</p>


<p>It's absolutely a good thing to take ideas from a specific nerddom and try to generalise them. I love doing that, and claiming that it was bad would be the rankest hypocrisy on my part. The problem is not generalising his Tennis related learning off the tennis court, the problem is that having learned all these skills in a context where they are useful close to 100% of the time, you do not learn to understand the preconditions under which those skills are useful.</p>


<p>Annie Duke has made the same mistake: She has learned a skill set within the context of a game of poker, and is now viewing the relevant skill set as applicable to life as a whole. Unfortunately, Poker has some very distinctive features over life:</p>


<ol>
<li>It is intrinsically adversarial.</li>
<li>It is highly structured.</li>
<li>The probabilities of different outcomes are well defined and easily calculable.</li>
<li>It has a single well-defined utility function (money made) describing success in the game.</li>
</ol>


<p>As you may or may not be aware I love to hate on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_expected_utility">Subjective Expected Utility Theory</a>, but poker is an example where utility theory is great because you <em>do</em> have a utility function and you <em>do</em> have probabilities. Regardless of whether you believe in SEU, life outside poker simply isn't like that because the probabilities and the utility function are at best much more complex and less well defined.</p>


<p>(Note: Thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion">The Kelly Criterion</a> the utility function of poker is <em>not</em> just straight up money made, but its logarithm, but the point still stands).</p>


<p>Poker is an <em>excellent</em> game with which to hone your skills for a particular type of technical rationality, but technical rationality will only take you so far.</p>


<p>C. Thi Nguyen suggests that games are <a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/NGUGAT-2.pdf">ways of experimenting with different structures of agency</a>. In playing a game, you are entering a world in which your choices are constrained to follow the rules of the game, and so you learn to play <em>as if</em> those were the only choices possible. As a result you will <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html">learn skills that you are neglecting in other contexts</a> where those constraints on your agency do not apply. Learning the inner game of tennis <em>will</em> teach you about embodied cognition, because you can't think your way out of the problem. Learning poker <em>will</em> teach you about technical rationality, because you can't sweet talk your way out of the problem. Both embodied cognition and technical rationality are very good skills that you can apply in life more broadly, but because life lacks that restricted structure of agency that the game had. The reason the game taught you that skill so well was precisely <em>because</em> the skill is not universally applicable.</p>


<p>David Chapman has recently published an <a href="https://meaningness.com/eggplant/introduction">updated introduction to his Eggplant Book</a>, which is about what he calls metarationality, that I rather like. In particular:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[People with metarational skills] produce these insights by investigating the relationship between a system of technical rationality and its context. The context includes a specific situation in which rationality is applied, the purposes for which it is used, the social dynamics of its use, and other rational systems that might also be brought to bear. This work operates not within a system of technical rationality, but around, above, and then on the system.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This applies more broadly than technical rationality: The foundational skill of life is figuring out what other skills you need to bring to bear on the situation. You cannot learn that from a game, because games work precisely by removing the need for that skill.
Games are an excellent way to hone certain skills, but they intrinsically lack the ability to teach you the fundamental life skill of <em>knowing which game you are playing</em>.</p>


<p>All of which is a very long winded way of getting around to a very basic point prompted by the initial quote: Hindsight bias is good, actually.</p>


<p>Hindsight bias is generally bad in poker where you can have very well defined strategies and intrinsic quantifiable uncertainty in the problem, but in life more broadly hindsight bias serves several fairly important functions. For example:</p>


<ol>
<li>It forces you to look at problems much more carefully than you otherwise would have, giving you incentives to improve your skills.</li>
<li>It lets you hold people accountable for actions even when they are individually harmless.</li>
</ol>


<p>An example of the first is that when writing it is generally worth assuming that any misunderstands are your fault. They may often not be - many people are very bad readers - but by treating them as your fault anyway your writing skills will generally improve.</p>


<p>An example of the second is something I often use as a moral test case and requires a bit more of an extended anecdote.</p>


<p>Near my parents' place there is a more-or-less blind bend in the main road with a small road that joins on to the main road right after that bend. It is very poor design.</p>


<p>Almost nobody comes down that small road. I've seen someone joining on to the main road from there maybe two or three times during many years of driving that road.</p>


<p>It's entirely viable to take the bend at 60mph if you ignore the side road. It's not <em>that</em> sharp a bend. However, the signage wants you to take it at 25mph in order to account for that basically-never-used side road.</p>


<p>Now, my question is this: How fast should you take that bend?</p>


<p>From a subjective expected utility point of view, it's actually probably fine to take that bend at 60mph. Slowing down at that point in the drive is quite annoying, and the chances of causing an accident are extremely low given the low usage of that side road (and it's not like an accident is inevitable at 60mph and more than it's entirely avoidable at 25mph, you're just increasing the likelihood and severity). Yes you're trading convenience for an increased probability of your own and/or someone else's death but of course you are, you're <em>driving</em>.</p>


<p>But, if everyone else makes the same calculation, driving in from that side road is now basically a death sentence.</p>


<p>Subjective Expected Utility calculations often look <em>very</em> different if you universalise them by assuming that everyone else will make similar calculations, but SEU calculations are hard enough as it is without reasoning this way, and there's an easy kludge to achieve much the same effect: Hindsight bias.</p>


<p>If we treat low-probability consequences as if we should have seen them coming, and punish them accordingly, then we change the incentives to shape individual behaviour away from creating outcomes that were inevitable in aggregate even if they were low probability in any given instance.</p>


<p>Is this unfair on the indidual who happens to trigger the low probablity consequence? Probably. But so is dying because everyone else was making individually rational calculations that decided a low probability of your death was an acceptable consequence.</p>


<p>Is hindsight bias always good? No, of course not. You have to figure out from context whether it is or not. But that skill of figuring it out from context is not, I'm afraid, something you can learn from a game.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Inner Pedestal of Tennis</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-27</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2LUnchH">The Inner Game of Tennis</a> by W. Timothy Gallwey, page 129:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I have been my own worst stressor. But slowly I have found that the demands I'm trying to fulfill when I'm stressing myself are not really my own, but ones I have "picked up" or "bought into" for perhaps no better reason than I heard them early in life, or because they seemed to be so generally accepted. Soon they begin to sound right - and are therefore easier to listen to than the subtle but insistent urging of my own being.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this gets to the heart of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html">my disagreement with Gallwey</a>, which largely stems from the fact that in this paragraph almost every word he says is wrong.</p>


<p>Indeed, I think this book is entirely a giant bait and switch: He makes the (mostly) useful distinction between (ugh) "Self 1", the teller, and "Self 2", the doer. This is a reasonable split which is useful in many circumstances. I don't necessarily think it's a <em>true</em> split, but it works pretty well for about 90% of cases.</p>


<p>Unfortunately he then goes on to posit that:</p>


<ol>
<li>Self 1 is intrinsically dysfunctional.</li>
<li>Self 2 is intrinsically functional.</li>
<li>Every other binary split of your self, including "the bad bits" and "the good bits" also lines up with this distinction.</li>
</ol>


<p>Every single one of these premises is badly wrong. It is certainly true for many people that Self 1 is dyfunctional and Self 2 is functional, but those dysfunctions are not intrinsic and treating them as such is actively harmful. The third is just intrinsically nonsense and is the sign of someone with an explain everything theory.</p>


<p>All of these errors manifest in this paragraph.</p>


<p>Anyway, specifically what he is wrong about in this paragraph boils down to two important glaring errors:</p>


<ol>
<li>Almost everything in you is learned from outside of you. That's not you listening to things that are "not really your own". That is how being a person works. We socially construct our knowledge and behaviours by engaging with the people around us. You are complaining about being a person, Tim.</li>
<li>The arising internally/learned externally split of your behaviour <em>in no way</em> maps on to the self 1 / self 2 distinction. Self 2 <em>absolutely</em> learns and internalises lessons from the outside world. That's what trauma, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">emotional responses more broadly</a>, are. This is why operant conditioning works.</li>
</ol>


<p>I mean FFS, really.</p>


<p>I listen to a lot of <a href="https://www.therapistuncensored.com/">Therapist Uncensored</a> and an interesting theme that keeps coming up listening to it is that they're also quite into a similar split to Self 1 vs Self 2 (they tend to neurowash it and refer to it by parts of the brain, but that's neither here nor there), but they think that <em>Self 2</em> is the dysfunctional one and that a lot of the skills they're trying to learn are essentially trying to use Self 1 to help Self 2 heal from its entrained fear reactions.</p>


<p>I think here I must adopt my usual brand of fence sitting: Actually, both sides are wrong.</p>


<p>Self 1 and Self 2 each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and you cannot operate as a fully healthy human being without:</p>


<ol>
<li>A functional Self 1.</li>
<li>A functional Self 2.</li>
<li>A functional relationship between the two.</li>
</ol>


<p>Self 2 needs to give Self 1 a hug, and Self 1 needs to help Self 2 to talk about its feelings. They're literally both in this together, and they should behave as such.</p>


<p>The relationship is the important part, and Gallwey's framing basically fucks up any chance of a healthy relationship.</p>


<p>Putting someone on a pedestal basically dooms any possibility of a healthy relationship with them, and this is what we are doing when we claim Self 2 is in some sense intrinsically whole and just needs to be let free. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-03-09:07.html">Self 2 is wrong all the time</a> and that's OK. It's wrong in ways that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">Self 1 is good at helping it resolve</a>. Self 1 does tend to get a bit neurotic if left in control, it's true, but Self 2 just needs to give it a bit of a hug and tell it to calm down and let the body do its thing (I've not yet figured out a better tool for this than actual hugs unfortunately).</p>
