<p class="subtitle">Building and Rebuilding Foundational Skills</p>

<p>I have a problem: I'm kinda OK at statistics.</p>


<p>Why is this a problem? Being kinda OK seems... kinda OK, right?</p>


<p>Well, it would be, but the problem isn't that I have an intermediate level of statistical skill. The problem is that I have a broad range of statistical skill, all of which I'm kinda OK at. I'm kinda OK at elementary statistics, and I'm kinda OK at advanced statistics too.</p>


<p>This is a real problem for learning more, because it is <em>hard</em> to relearn basics because they feel too basic for my skill level.</p>


<p>I have another problem: Climbing is a fun sport that makes a good social activity and works on a number of strength skills that I would like to work on. Also I give myself a back injury 100% of the time I do it, because my ability to climb is much greater than my skill at climbing, because I'm hypermobile and have a decent strength to body weight ratio, and the result is that despite some things feeling easy, I do them badly and this results in me inadvertently harming myself while doing them.</p>


<p>All of these share a common theme: It is possible for something to be easy while still being bad at it, and this is especially true with foundational skills, where you've built capabilities on top of them, and going back and relearning the basics is hard and boring.</p>


<p>In order to get good at statistics, I'd need to grind a bunch of exercises that I frankly feel are beneath me.
I'm probably going to try (despite my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-03-09:09.html">complicated feelings about mathematics</a>) because being good at statistics is important for me professionally and spiritually, and I'll never get good at it until I sort out the basics, and also being bad at those basics risks me tripping up in stupid ways.</p>


<p>In order to get good at climbing, I'd need to very carefully (and probably with supervision) try far easier routes than I can manage, and stop far sooner than it seems like I can. I'd have to deliberately hold myself back until I was much better at the basics than I am, despite my ability to do more. I don't value climbing enough at present to do this, so I probably will just avoid climbing.</p>


<p>Anyway, this is is why I'm currently restarting the first week of Couch to 5K despite having completed it relatively easily.</p>


<p>Here's another problem: I obviously breathe badly.</p>


<p>I'm not fully sold on the Buteyko method, which encourages you to breathe less and entirely through your nose, but I obviously mouth breathe at night based on my sleep quality and dry mouth in the morning, and my peak flow numbers aren't great. I'd like to work on this to the point where I breathe through my nose unconsciously and easily, even while sleeping. It probably won't change my life in the way that the Buteyko method promises (though it sure would be nice if it did!), but at the very least it might improve my sleep quality.</p>


<p>Breathing is definitely a foundational skill, and it's one I'm bad at, so I'd like to work on it, and working on breathing is <em>deathly</em> boring.</p>


<p>This is where I link in three previous tools:</p>


<p>I can nose breathe just fine while at rest. I can complete couch to 5k week one (consistent of eight repetitions of a 60 second run followed by a 90 second walk) just fine. What I absolutely cannot do is complete Couch to 5K week one while nasal breathing. I can just about manage the first run and then I am <em>wrecked</em>.</p>


<p>I think this is the way to rebuild foundations, and one of the core reasons why <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html">learning a different skill</a> is often essential for progressing at your current goal: By transferring to a different context where the foundational skill is no longer easy, it becomes a thing that you can now actively work at. Working on a foundation in its existing context is often too easy to be possible, so <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:12.html">the way to work on it is to make it harder</a>.</p>


<p>I was in fact, already considering restarting week one of Couch to 5K, for two other reasons, both of which are also about foundational skills.</p>


<p>As well as breathing, I'm also bad at walking.</p>


<p>Yes, I'm aware that these are both ridiculous things to be bad at. I think a lot of you reading this are probably bad at them too though. As I said, we have <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html">a widespread lack of the basic skills of being a human being</a>.</p>


<p>Specifically, I have quite flat feet and weak arches, and a bunch of (probably) related joint pain. I've tried wearing arch support shoes and my considered opinion is that it was an expensive waste of time. (Well, it was a good <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">experiment</a>).</p>


<p>A slightly less fringe (but still fringe) opinion is that the solution to this is actually to have <em>less</em> arch support, and to wear barefoot shoes that are designed to protect your feet without supporting them,
because this causes you to actually develop your muscles rather than weaken them.</p>


<p>This seems worth a shot, and I was noticing that my ankles were already starting to hurt a bit as a result of week one. I don't want to end up in the situation like with climbing where my ability to do a run exceeds my ability to do a run without injuring myself, so this too seems like a thing I could reasonably make harder in order to work on the foundational skills of.</p>


<p>Even without these foundations of breathing and walking, I was still thinking it might be worth repeating Couch to 5K, because I disagree with some of its philosophical premises.</p>


<p>Couch to 5K is designed to ramp up the difficulty level by making you run more, and more consistently. I personally think it ramps up the difficulty too quickly. I basically agree with Sarah Perry's point in <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/03/body-pleasure/">Body Pleasure</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[...] people enjoy exercise up to a certain level of intensity, which varies for each person. Most people who do low-intensity exercise feel better during the mild exertion. At the point when the body can no longer maintain levels of oxygen and (separately) lactate in the muscles, the exercise becomes so intense that basic affect (feeling good or feeling bad, the lowest-level evaluation of anything) plummets. Everybody feels terrible when they exercise too hard. Once people rest for a few minutes, they start feeling good again. However, this may not be enough such that people evaluate the entire experience as pleasurable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most on-ramps to exercise are at an intensity too high for previously-sedentary people to find them pleasurable. If people go to a fitness class, or focus on running a particular distance at a particular speed, they’ll likely miss the pleasure zone entirely. Refocusing on exercising only for one’s own individual pleasure, as slowly as one prefers, and only at intensities that are pleasurable, is more likely to motivate repeat and habitual exercising. At that point, the enjoyment of exercise pleasure can build on itself, motivating longer and longer intervals of experiencing the pleasure. I summarize Ekkekakis et al.’s result as: “learn to exercise out of extreme selfish laziness.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I was a little skeptical about doing Couch to 5K because one of the things I'm trying to work on at the moment is to enjoy exercise, and honestly I don't enjoy running. I'd already been vaguely considering restarting week one so that I could get to the point where it was pleasurable rather than merely endurable.</p>


<p>I liked <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1258846038552489984">David Laing's point the other day</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Advice on how to get better at a given thing should often be replaced with advice on how to take more pleasure in doing that thing.</p>
<p>Pleasure doesn't lead directly to learning, but it leads to <em>volume</em>, which leads to learning. Also pleasure is an end in itself.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I don't know exactly how to create pleasure in a thing, but I suspect fluidity is a huge part of it. There is something intrinsically pleasurable about being good enough at something hard that you can do it automatically and reliably, and I think fluidity is extremely helpful for being able to play with a skill.</p>


<p>I suspect this points to a general reason why we are so often bad at foundations: We treat the point at which we should progress as to when we <em>can</em> do the thing, when in fact we should be progressing when it's <em>pleasurable</em> to do it (or at least fluid where pleasure is impossible). This ties in to the idea that you are not good at doing a thing until you are able to do it reliably rather than able to do it at all.</p>


<p>If you progress as soon as you clear some minimum bar of being <em>able</em> to do it, then what happens is that the skill will get progressively more and more frustrating as you move up it until you hit some "natural" limit where your frustration exceeds your willingness to progress, and you can no longer easily go back and work on the foundations, so you conclude that you're now as good as you're goign to get.</p>


<p>For reasons, I was reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem">Bloom's 2 sigma problem</a> recently, which is often used as evidence for the superiority of private tutoring over general classes, but I found the description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning">mastery learning</a>, which is the specific system being compared, especially interesting:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In comparison, I think most of our school based learning techniques are like Couch to 5K: They assume that there is some straightforward time frame on which you can expect people to progress, and you should progress as long as you can just about manage the previous level, and failure to progress is a sign of significant failure.</p>


<p>How much of the 2 sigma system is about the benefits of individual instruction, and how much of it is just about giving people the time to build their foundations before progressing?</p>


<p>This all fits in well to the framework of the <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">Fully General System for Learning to Do Hard Things</a>, but I think I have previously neglected something important: It's not at all obvious what <em>hard</em> and <em>easy</em> mean in this context. I suspect the threshold for progression should be set much higher than I previously would have set it.</p>


<p>Couch to 5K fits pretty well into the Fully General System, in that it repeatedly takes something that you can do (Week N) and makes it slightly harder (Week N + 1), eventually culminating in being able to do a half hour run. It seems pretty good, for a lot of people, in that it gets them to do something that would previously have seemed unattainable, but I'm no longer convinced that either it or the Fully General System are good enough for that.</p>


<p>I think this notion of foundational skills, and the question of mastery progression, point to a common flaw in Couch to 5K and the Fully General System: They are overly narrowly focused on the goal, and don't care about what possible future progress they burn along the way to getting there.</p>


<p>So I'm still going to try to do hard things, and I'm still going to complete Couch to 5K, but in doing so my aims are not merely to do a half hour run but to do a half hour run while breathing entirely through my nose, wearing barefoot shoes, and enjoying it, and all the while paying attention to the process and using it to learn more about progression and skill development in general.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How to be a better person</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-10</dd>
</dl>


<p>In response to my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html">Initial notes towards a manifesto</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joxn">@joXn</a> quite reasonably asked how I would avoid falling afoul of the problem that, contra The Good Place, learning ethics doesn't actually make one more ethical. Eric Schwitzgebel has a lot of great research on this (see <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/">his publications</a> and in particular the section "The Relationship Between Moral Reflection and Moral Behavior").</p>


<p>Of these, I think <a href="https://faculty.ucr.edu/~eschwitz/SchwitzAbs/MoralMediocrity.htm">Aiming for Moral Mediocrity</a> is perhaps the most important:
Schwitzgebel argues that most people probably aim to be about as moral as their peers, and that this is mediocre (neither great, nor terrible) to do, but that most people could manage to be better than they are with no great hardship.</p>


<p>I think Schwitzgebel's claim is basically right, and the paper is a very good one, with two major caveats:</p>


<ol>
<li>He is underestimating the hardship, because (I think) he is missing one of the reasons why this happens.</li>
<li>He has fallen afoul of precisely the reason why learning ethics does not make you a better person.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think there are approximately four reasons why people fail to behave ethically:</p>


<ol>
<li>They do not care to do the right thing.</li>
<li>They are discouraged from doing the right thing by external factors.</li>
<li>They do not know what the right thing is.</li>
<li>They do not know how to do the right thing.</li>
</ol>


<p>Behaving ethically is a skillful practice, and most people are either not very good at the skill, not very motivated to practice it, or do not have an environment that enables them to practice it.</p>


<p>Ethicists primarily study what the right thing to do is, but I think for most people this is not the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html">constraint</a> on the skillful practice of ethics.</p>


<p>I will, for the purpose of this post, assume that people <em>care</em> to do the right thing. I think fixing that is a whole different question. This leaves the other three. Given that we know from Schwitzgebel's work that knowing the right thing to do is also not enough, lets assume for the moment that you, in most practical circumstances if not necessarily in general, know what the right thing to do is. Why don't you do it?</p>


<p>Well, lets take a look at Schwitzgebel's theme of Moral Mediocrity: Why do people aim to be morally mediocre?</p>


<p>I propose that there's a very straightforward reason: Moral Mediocrity is the option that won't get you punished.</p>


<p>If you behave badly, people will be judgemental towards you. But they will also react badly to you if you are especially moral. It's not just that you're not a saint it's that, in actual practice, we don't <em>like</em> saints, because they make us feel bad about ourselves.</p>


<p>One of the examples in the paper is vegetarianism. Suppose you were reasonably convinced that, ethically speaking, you should be a vegetarian or vegan. Now, all your interactions with people around you around food come with extra friction. Even if you never say anything judgy about it, it's impossible for people to not know you're vegetarian (if they're sharing meals with you) and many of them will respond defensively or aggressively about it. You'll experience a constant, albeit low grade, pressure of the people around you trying to drag you back down to their moral level.</p>


<p>You'll see this with other things too: Someone who is unusually ethical will constantly have people telling them to relax, take things less seriously, etc. Being unusually ethical is weird, and triggers the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html">social obligation to be bad at things</a> in a big way.</p>


<p>This is not, I hasten to add, a moral justification for being morally mediocre. It doesn't change what you <em>should</em> do. If anything, the tendency of people to norm their behaviour to those around them creates a stronger moral obligation to be good, because it influences others to be good. It is a <em>practical barrier to ethical behaviour</em>, and any theory of ethics that does not teach you to overcome such practical barriers will not result in more ethical behaviour any more than a detailed understanding of thermodynamics will allow you to build an internal combustion engine. A theory of ethics is all very well, but you need a <em>practice</em> of ethics, which is what Schwitzgebel's paper (along with most theory of ethics) misses: Telling people to behave a particular way tends not to work unless you tell them <em>how</em> to behave that way.</p>


<p>Here's another practical barrier: If you realise that you are behaving badly, and decide to be better, you have to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html">reconcile yourself to the fact that you could always have been better</a>, which is very painful, so you would much rather rationalise your behaviour as just fine the way it is to avoid that pain.</p>


<p>And for another, consider the following scenario: Suppose you decide to be vegetarian, and you're really good about it for about a month, virtuously resisting the temptation to eat meat, and absolutely hating how bland all your food has become because you don't know how to cook interesting vegetarian food and the cafeteria where you mostly eat has awful vegetarian food. After about a month, you go out for a meal with some friends, and you look at the incredibly disappointing vegetarian menu and your eyes are drawn to the cheesburger selection... and after that you're no longer vegetarian.</p>


<p>This actually demonstrates <em>two</em> problems: Firstly, you don't know how to be vegetarian, and are trying to overcome that limitation with pure willpower rather than treating it as a practical problem you need to solve, and the second is that you don't understand behaviour change so you tried to go all in on the new behaviour and then gave up as soon as you failed once.</p>


<p>These are the three main practical barriers to overcome: Social norms, emotional difficulties, and missing skills, and all of these are emimently solvable problems that you can learn to overcome, and that you will find personally beneficial to learn to overcome regardless of whether you use them to become more ethical.</p>


<p>More, I think once you have acquired these skills, you will naturally become more ethical (or at least, more in line with your own values): If you can change when you feel like you should, and you feel like you should behave a particular way, then you'll just do that.</p>


<p>So this is my answer to how I'm intending to avoid this problem: I don't plan to try to persuade anyone of the rightness of a particular position, I'm just doing my best to convey some fragments of useful prosocial skills, and trusting that as you get better at those skills you'll become a better person automatically.</p>


<p>Mostly, at least. You'll probably still be bad occasionally. That's OK. It's more fun to be a bit evil from time to time.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Initial Notes Towards a Manifesto</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-09</dd>
</dl>


<p>Mechanical Monk <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1258738843630678016">invited his mutuals to write a manifesto</a>. This is my response to that, though given that this is a notebook it's a more modest attempt to gesture in the direction of what a manifesto would look like when I'm a bit more ready for it.</p>


<p>So what do I want? How do I want to change the world?</p>


<p>Well I'd like to be able to claim some high minded ideal like universal love and cosmic oneness but that's not what I'm about. What I'm about is this: Dear humanity, we are <em>fucking this up</em>, and it's annoying me and I'm embarrassed to be a part of it. I really shouldn't be the one to have to tell people how to sort their shit out because I'm terrible at this but apparently nobody else is going to do it right, so <em>fine</em>.</p>


<p>What do I mean by this?</p>


<p>I mean that we are universally lacking in the basic systems, skills, and ethics, of being functioning, healthy, happy, human beings, and we need to fix that, and instead we are making it worse. We do not have a society that supports the development of those, and in many ways <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html">we actively punish their acquisition</a>.</p>


<p>An incomplete list of things we are bad at include thinking, feeling, moving, communicating, decision making, organisation, and helping each other out more broadly. Some of us are good enough at some of these things, but essentially nobody is at what I would like to consider the bare minimum standard for all of them (I sure as hell am not!).</p>


<p>Currently I think we have roughly the following models for acquiring these skills:</p>


<ol>
<li>Dumb luck and/or privilege in having the right role models (unreliable).</li>
<li>School (monstrously bad at this, not really designed to do it)</li>
<li>Therapy and coaching (limited scope, expensive)</li>
<li>Weird borderline cults (tend to overfocus on an aspect of the problem and convince you it solves everything. Also, are cults)</li>
<li>Self-help books (similar problems to cults, also mostly very bad)</li>
</ol>


<p>All of these are grossly inadequate to the task.</p>


<p>So I'm trying to push back on it. I cannot, at present, fix society and reshape it into a more pleasing image (though if you <em>want</em> me to do that and can hand me the keys I uh have one or two ideas), but I <em>can</em> provide people with tools that may help them under the current circumstances.</p>


<p>I'm acquiring the parts of these skills that I can figure out for myself, or with help, and I'm trying to be a model of how I think this should work. I'm helping other people around me take steps towards the same same, by writing about it, and by building relationships that support each other's growth.</p>


<p>And this <em>isn't going to work</em>. You cannot rely on me to teach you all the skills you need for several reasons:</p>


<ol>
<li>The notebook is pretty good, and I hope to do better writing about this in future, but the really high value work is in personal relationships, and there's only one of me.</li>
<li>My work is intrinsically built around my particular strengths and weaknesses - I'm a weird, queer, hyperverbal, nerd and so the problems I'm solving and the tools I'm using are designed with that in mind.</li>
<li>I am, as alluded to, <em>not very good at this</em>, and I'm going to miss things, get things wrong, or communicate them in unhelpful ways, and we need many different voices doing the same sorts of things if we are to have any chance of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-28-06:45.html">climbing out of the crab bucket</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>(2) doesn't mean that you can't benefit from my writing if you're not like me, but it does mean that my tools are built in a very particular way for a very particular set of problems. They might or might not work for you (possibly with modification), but even if they work for you they might not solve all your problems because they're designed to solve <em>my</em> problems (and, to a lesser extent, the problems of people I know well enough to help). You need to build your own tools too! And then, once you have, I want you to share them with other people.</p>


<p>And I want you to share them with other people while <em>understanding that their tools might not work for others</em>.
When I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-08-10:06.html">yesterday's post</a> I very clearly spelled out why this was a good solution for me, and that these might not be the same for you. All tools will be like this, but right now people tend to get very evangelical about how their tool is the one size fits all to all problems, and this is extremely wrong, both factually and morally.</p>


<p>I'm losing steam on writing more of this right now, so I'm going to just end with a list of things I want people to do:</p>


<ol>
<li>Cut people some slack. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-06-15:20.html">Create</a> <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a> for those around you. Sign non-aggression pacts in the goddamn <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-06-04-09:58.html">legibility war</a>.</li>
<li>Treat the problems in your life as interesting and worth solving.</li>
<li>Join and learn from <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">nerd</a> communities who can help you solve them.</li>
<li>Build <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html">growth relationships</a>, where everyone involved helps everyone else be better versions of themselves. I'm particularly a fan of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html">the support group model</a>, but this is one of those tools that might not work for everyone.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/">Explain</a> these things to others. Obviously I'm a fan of the notebook blog format, but again that might not be what works for you.</li>
</ol>


<p>I understand that what I am asking of you is difficult, and I understand that for some of you it may not yet be possible, but I'm trying my best to make it possible, and easy, for as many people as I can, and I hope that some of you will do the same.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Separating Impulse from Action</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-08</dd>
</dl>


<p>Here's a trick I figured out yesterday. It solves quite a specific problem that I have, but you might have similar problems, and even if not I think it demonstrates some useful general principles that could be applied in other circumstances.</p>


<p>The problem is this: I buy too many books.</p>


<p>It's not a <em>disaster</em> because I also read a lot of books, but I buy books at a higher rate than I read them, and I often buy books that I later decide that actually I'm not realistically going to read.</p>


<p>The problem is basically that when I encounter an interesting book whose ideas I would like inside my brain, I often impulsively buy it.</p>


<p>Some of this is a problem of impulse control, for sure, and I could definitely fix it by being better at impulse control, but currently I'm trying to be <em>less</em> good at impulse control, so that seems counterproductive.</p>


<p>An additional complication is that the correct amount of books for me to be buying is not zero. I <em>could</em> just blanket ban myself from buying books. I would experience it as unpleasant, but it's manageable, but that would not result in my buying the right number of books.
I <em>do</em> read a lot of books (typically between one and three a week, not counting fiction which are a separate category because I read them as ebooks), and I like having new books around, and I can definitely afford to spend a certain amount of money on books.</p>


<p>The additional complicating factor is that my bookshelves serve as a kind of... thoughts I want to have later? They're a TODO list for reading, and my experience is that I will lose track of digital TODO lists for reading - they will get too large, and I will forget about them and leave them to rot (I am even worse at digital <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html">care work</a> than physical).</p>


<p>So, I:</p>


<ol>
<li>Have a constant impulse to buy books, and suppressing it will be unpleasant.</li>
<li>Do actually want to buy a non-zero amount of books.</li>
<li>Need a way to keep track of the books I may want to buy later.</li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, there's an easy solution, and it's <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html">kinda stupid</a> that it's taken me this long to realise it.</p>


<p>The solution that satisfies all of these is to have:</p>


<ol>
<li>a default Amazon list of books I wanted to buy.</li>
<li>a scheduled task every Sunday to buy a book.</li>
</ol>


<p>Now when I want to impulse buy a book I instead just click the add to list button instead of the buy now button. Then, every Sunday, I go through the list and decide which of these books is the one I want to buy the most right now. In the course of doing so, I remove any books from the list that I'm definitely sure I won't want to buy later.</p>


<p>This solution is actually very good, because it:</p>


<ul>
<li>puts the rate at which I buy things under my conscious control independently of the impulse to buy things (a thing I learned the value of from years with <a href="http://beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a>).</li>
<li>gives a direct and (almost) equally satisfying replacement for the impulse activity by pressing a different and equally accessible button.</li>
<li>fights the digital rot that lists normally have for me by coupling it to a regularly scheduled activity that I <em>want</em> to do because I get rewarded with a book.</li>
</ul>


<p>In addition I think it will significantly increase the quality of the books I do buy, because each book I buy will be a measured choice between alternatives where invest some effort in ensuring that my book this week will be a good one. I don't intend to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">avoid all error</a> and I of course <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html">can't ensure I always pick the <em>best</em> one</a>, but I'm pretty sure that investing about twenty minutes of thought into the question will result in me improving on impulse decisions.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Easy changes and Uncomfortable Reflections</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>As I've talked about in my last two posts (<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-05-08:59.html">Making success trivial</a>, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-06-09:51.html">Cleaning up the fnords in your environment</a>), my bedroom is a mess. I'd like it not to be a mess, and I've recently made two changes that are enabling that:</p>


<ul>
<li>Using <a href="https://howtosurvivementalillness.tumblr.com/post/162396810334/how-to-make-and-use-a-coping-board">a coping board</a></li>
<li>Structuring longer cleaning around <a href="https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/whats-a-2010/">20/10s</a> (basically just pomodoros, but with some better ergonomics)</li>
</ul>


<p>My room is not currently clean, but it's a little cleaner than it was a week ago, and I think in a month it'll probably be pretty clean and I kinda expect to be able to keep it that way (I'll need to make some more structural changes than this in order to enable that, but these changes will get me to the point where the structural changes that I should make become more obvious).</p>


<p>You may notice something important about these two changes: They're really really easy, and I could have done them at any time.</p>


<p>What this means, is that a long-running problem of mine, something that I've been feeling bad about for well over a decade (and had for longer), is something that I could have trivially fixed any time I wanted to.</p>


<p>So, should I feel guilty about not having done so? More, should I feel <em>ashamed</em> about not having done so?</p>


<p>(Distinction in case it's helpful: Guilt is "I did a bad thing", shame is "I am bad")</p>


<p>I claim that the answer is no, and the answer is no for a variety of reasons.</p>


<p>The main one is that having negative emotional responses to success is maladaptive. It causes you to not want to succeed, and will tend to destroy the motivation to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">try things</a>, and will cause you to feel bad while building the habit, which will tend to sabotage the habit.</p>


<p>It might be right, in some circumstances, to feel a certain amount of guilt or shame over this, as long as they are proportionate (i.e. don't spiral out of control) and are more than counterbalanced by the positive feelings of success, but sucess does require confronting the honest truth that you are capable of succeeding, and that can be very unpleasant.</p>


<p>If you experience success as a negative, you will tend to discourage yourself from succeeding. This is relatively obvious when it's pointed out, but is a very easy trap to fall into. If you have this problem I'd recommend my previous <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/01/a-crash-course-in-having-feelings/">Crash Course in Having Feelings</a>.</p>


<p>On top of that, I think it is <em>factually incorrect</em> to feel guilt or shame about behaviour change, because it is the nature of change to be easy once it arrives: If you're having to force yourself through a gruelling process to change, you're probably just going to fail.</p>


<p>Instead what happens is that you gradually build up skills and relationships, or your circumstances change, or one of a dozen other possibilities occur and suddenly change is easy. The thing that makes change easy now wouldn't necessarily have worked if you'd tried it five years ago, or ten, and even if it had worked you wouldn't have necessarily known how to find it among the thousands of other equally easy things that seemed equally plausible but wouldn't have worked for you.</p>
