<p class="subtitle">Studying the mundane</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>One of the things that you might notice about the things that I write is that they're often about really mundane topics.</p>


<p>Here are some examples:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/telegraph-your-moves">Telegraph your moves</a> contains a significant discussion of why you should tell people when you're running late.</li>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-should-complain-about-it">You should complain about it</a> is about complaining (obviously).</li>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-do-everything">How to do everything</a> is almost entirely about this (I do briefly talk about mathematics and writing, but mostly it's not about that) and touches on profound topics such as how to catch a ball, how to clean your bathroom, and how to open a bag of rice.</li>
</ul>


<p>I do not write about mundane topics because they are sources of deep philosophical insight. I write about them because I am actually trying to solve mundane problems. I said in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-03-13:55.html">No shortage of things to write about</a> that "in order to run out of things to write, I'd have to basically have life solved. I'm uh a little ways away from that". This is true. But necessarily a significant number of the problems I have not solved in my life are mundane, because most of life is mundane, and I still think these problems are worth writing about.</p>


<p>This isn't to say that I'm <em>only</em> interested in mundane problems, but mundane problems are important, and often <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/life-complete-problems">life complete</a> in interesting ways, and by their very mundanity will often have high impact. I don't know if my writing has ever made anyone blissfully happy, but I do know multiple people who have improved the way they cleaned their bathroom and had a slightly less annoying rice opening experience as a result, and that too is part of the good life.</p>


<p>A particular reason I study and think about mundane things is that I think that there's often a lot of low hanging fruit available for improving them. People don't spend much time thinking about mundane problems, and even less time on how to communicate improvements in them.</p>


<p>To a large degree this is rational: You essentially improve until what you've got is "good enough" and it's not worth figuring out how to improve further.
Importantly though, the effort that isn't worth it is that of <em>figuring out</em> how to improve further. Often doing better is lower effort than what you're doing now, or very high benefit. Once you know how to do something the better way, it's clearly worth doing it that way (if it weren't, it wouldn't be a better way, it would be a way with a different set of trade offs), but that doesn't mean it's worth inventing that better way.</p>


<p>(It may also still not be worth learning that better way, or you may not want to, and that's fine. I'm both not that great at tying my shoes and know full well I could fix this with a couple of hours spent studying <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm">Ian Fieggen's Shoe Lace website</a>, but have I done that? I absolutely have not)</p>


<p>I on the other hand am perfectly happy to put in that effort, because I find it interesting, and I have time to spend, and also there's a lot of stuff that other people seem to be "naturally" good at that I've had to figure out the hard way, so once I've invested all that mental infrastructure in learning this stuff I might as well keep going.</p>


<p>And... it turns out it's not that hard. There are some core skills that it's worth developing, but they're generally useful core skills for life, mundane or otherwise. Mostly you just need to learn to break out of habits, spot patterns, and identify where you've taken problems as immutable when they're actually easily fixable things. I'm not claiming this is <em>easy</em>, but it's not rocket surgery or anything, and almost by definition it's a skillset for making most parts of your life better.</p>


<p>It does take time and energy, and I'm aware those are both often in short supply, so I don't expect too many people to do as much thinking about this as I do, but that's fine. I don't mind having a niche, and I expect I'll keep it. After all, literally nobody else is ever going to <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/refusing-to-learn">explain how to keep your flat clean in terms of the work of James C. Scott on the early development of agrarian states</a>.</p>


<p>(Although I could totally see <a href="https://goula.sh/">Meekaale</a> doing this with Hubert Dreyfus and Alasdair MacIntyre instead)</p>

<p class="subtitle">Start from amazing</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-06</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm out of spoons for the piece about taste I was going to be writing today, so I'll finish it off some other day.
Instead, here's a short piece to think about.</p>


<p>You know that thing that happens, where you say you don't like something, and someone tells you that you've probably just never tried a good example of it?</p>


<p>It's annoying, right?</p>


<p>Sometimes it's annoying in that way where someone tells you that you should exercise more, get more daylight, eat your greens. That sort of thing. You know it, and you know it's true, but god it sounds like so much <em>work</em>.</p>


<p>Sometimes it's annoying because you <em>have</em> tried versions that everyone tells you are good, and they still haven't worked for you.
Maybe they were kinda fine, maybe they still had something you didn't like, maybe something else. Either way, you've tried the examples that people have collectively decided are good, and you've concluded the whole thing just isn't to you.</p>


<p>First off, I should say, it's completely OK to not like something. This is allowed. Not everything has to be for you. There's not nearly enough time to like everything, and there's no obligation to like things you don't want to.</p>


<p>But sometimes you find yourself in a position where you <em>want</em> to like something, but the things everyone suggests as good aren't really working for you.</p>


<p>I think this is because the recommendation of trying good things is wrong. Don't try good things, try amazing things. When you're trying to learn to like something, anything short of amazing isn't going to cut it.</p>


<p>Ideally, try things that even people who are no more than passingly into the genre think are amazing, because that the scene thinks is amazing is often a bit esoteric and relies on things that you will not really appreciate until you are more familiar with the genre (in much the same way <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-04-12:52.html">that you won't yet get the jokes</a>).</p>


<p>Really though, the goal here is not to use some external measure of amazingness - that's just a good way to find candidates - but to find things that <em>you</em> think are amazing, that are so good that all of your objections to the genre are blown away and you find yourself faced with the inescapable conclusion that <em>of course</em> you like this, how could you not?</p>


<p>In the long run, not everything you consume will be amazing of course, but finding things that are amazing lets you anchor your sense of what's good about what you are trying to learn to appreciate. The qualities that you experience in the amazing examples are the qualities you are looking for in subtler forms in the good. But it's easier to start with things that blow you away and work backwards from there than it is to spend a lot of time in an ambiguous space going "Am I enjoying this? I don't know? Maybe?" trying to appreciate the finer qualities of something that you are currently experiencing as merely OK.</p>


<p>Starting from the amazing examples is the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html">existence proof</a> that you need. You have demonstrated that you <em>can</em> enjoy the thing, all you need now is to expand outwards Now you just need to work outwards from there using the <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">fully general system</a>.</p>


<p>Part of the context for this is that I have an ongoing sense that I would like to learn to appreciate poetry. Not that I <em>should</em>, but that I would like to. I'll freely admit I haven't tried very hard, but what I have tried hasn't worked very well.</p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LisaIRMcNulty">Lisa</a> recently suggested that maybe I needed to listen to it instead of read it,
because really poetry is always intended to be experienced in spoken form, and suggested I try some of the videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ButtonPoetry">Button Poetry</a>.</p>


<p>I spent a while clicking through some no doubt perfectly good poetry that was doing absolutely nothing for me, and was just about to conclude this as a failed experiment when I happened across the following:</p>


<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFTASR8BMps" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>


<p>The experience of watching this was not unlike accidentally stepping out in front of a truck full of feelings, and left me shaking for about an hour. It may not hit you that way, that's fine. This reaction isn't for you, it's for me.</p>


<p>But this is the level of reaction you should be seeking. Something that takes your previous ambivalence and washes it away it away in a flood, a revelation leaving you with no choice but to say "Oh. I get it now."</p>

<p class="subtitle">Why do we need new terminology?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-05</dd>
</dl>


<p>This piece is off the back of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-02-09:29.html">People are bad at defining things</a>. You should read that piece first. You don't strictly <em>need</em> to read that piece first, but this post will have a lot more context if you do.</p>


<p>When you try to write using only easy to understand words, it can be hard to say what you mean because you have to use many words where a smaller number will do. As well as making it harder to write, this can make it harder to read, because every time you want to use the thing that you talked about in many words you have to use all those words again.</p>


<p>When you do this it helps more people to understand what you have written, but every single person who could understand the shorter way of writing it will find it harder to understand the longer way of writing it because each time they read those many words they have to make sure it is the same thing.</p>


<p>Sometimes it helps to make up new words that you can use instead of the many words that you would have to write. This makes it easier for people to read what you have written because you can use the word you made up each time you would have written many words and they know it means the same thing each time.</p>


<p>I wrote that in the <a href="https://splasho.com/upgoer5/">upgoer five text editor</a>, which requires you to write using only the ten hundred most common words (thousand is not in the thousand most common words you see), and it was kinda annoying.</p>


<p>What I wanted to say is this: Using a small vocabulary helps more people understand what you write, but it makes the text much longer. As a result, every person who could understand the larger vocabulary easily will tend to find it easier to understand the version that uses it fully, because each new word replaces a concept that took many words in the smaller vocabulary. Reading that single word each time is faster and doesn't require people to read the longer phrase to understand that you mean the same thing each time. As a result, it's often useful to introduce new terms that represent complicated concepts you're talking about to give people a handle on the concept they can use while reading your text.</p>


<p>I don't know that the version with the larger vocabulary is <em>that</em> much better than the version in up goer five. I'm certainly happier with it, but I think for short texts it doesn't matter that much and it's repetition over the course of a longer text that matters.</p>


<p>Also sometimes you have a thing that you don't totally understand yet and it is nice to have a word that you can use to mean that thing while you talk around it. You can show things that are not what you mean and things that are what you mean, but you can't say exactly what it is you mean. Here it's really important to have a single word for it so you don't have to keep saying "that thing that I mean and am talking around".</p>


<p>Which, translated out of upgoer five, is to say: Sometimes you have a concept that you don't know how to define precisely and want to talk about, and you can't just keep saying "that concept that I haven't defined yet that I introduced back there", you need some sort of placeholder you can talk about.</p>


<p>This is why I talked about example-based definitions: You introduce the terminology, and you do your best to convey the rough sense of what you mean and provide examples to help refine it. By introducing a new word, you have given yourself the ability to talk about something that you would previously only have been able to talk around.</p>


<p>To summarise all of this: We sometimes need new terminology because, used well, it helps you communicate what you mean in a way that people will find easier to understand.</p>


<p>If this feels like an alien concept, very different to your experience of how people use novel terminology, yes that's right. That's why I'm complaining about people using definitions badly.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The humour test for expertise</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-04</dd>
</dl>


<p>A heuristic I sometimes use is this: You understand something at a reasonably expert level if and only if you get the jokes at a level where you could find it funny.</p>


<p>I started thinking about this when I watched this video:</p>


<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VD5I4l9oASg" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>


<p>This video is hilarious. If you don't play Slay the Spire much you won't understand why. I can explain why, and I can even explain why well enough that you in some way understand it, but I cannot explain it in a way that allows you to find it funny without teaching you to play Slay the Spire, because the humour derives entirely from an understanding of the game.</p>


<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay">the quine relay</a> is hilarious, but if you're not a programmer you absolutely won't find it funny, it's just weird and pointless.</p>


<p>The reason for this link between expertise and humour is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories_of_humor#Incongruous_juxtaposition_theory">the incongruity theory of humour</a>: You have a particular set of expectations about how the game is played, and the video repeatedly violates those assumptions by playing the game in slightly unexpected ways. This is not how a Defect build is supposed to work, but it's definitely how <em>this</em> Defect build works.</p>


<p>Because humour derives from incongruity, if you can get the jokes in a field then you must have a sense of incongruity. This means that you've internalised the sort of intuition about what the expected normal for the field is - the field's norms of taste, a working knowledge for how everything typically goes and fits together. These are all signs of expertise, that you've progressed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence">Unconscious Competence stage</a>.</p>


<p>The humour test for expertise is itself a sort of joke, and the fact that I find it funny is probably an indication that I've at least started to get something of a handle on the expertise literature (or just that I'm weird), but it's also serious and I think probably points in a number of interesting directions.</p>


<p>In particular, although you can't explain specialist jokes in a way that makes them funny, it may be worth explaining them, as it will often reveal interesting things about expert intuition that might not otherwise be readily accessible.</p>


<p>Another application of the test is that the jokes you find funny probably tell you something about your areas of expertise that you hadn't realised. This may be an uncomfortable realisation because e.g. it causes you to realise quite how much time you've spent playing Slay the Spire.</p>

<p class="subtitle">No shortage of things to write about</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-03</dd>
</dl>


<p>Back in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/fragments-intellectual-diy">Intellectual DIY</a> I recounted a conversation with my father in which I explained that all of my reading and writing was more by way of a vast intellectual DIY project:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Last year I had a conversation with my father in which he said how impressed he was with my memory and general breadth of knowledge and intellectual achievement, and that he could certainly never do anything like that.</p>
<p>I expressed polite scepticism at this claim and pointed out that his sheer breadth of practical knowledge far outstripped mine. He seems to know everything about DIY, and is generally prepared to wade in and do a good job on just about anything you might expect to do around the home, from heat pump engineering to building furniture. He's been building some stairs recently, as one does. He is finally starting to come around to the idea that maybe he doesn't have to do everything himself, but generally it's not a question of whether he can do it himself, but whether he can do this thing and all of the thousand other tasks he's taken on. This is of course all before we even start on his actual professional skill set (he was a banker before he retired).</p>
<p>He objected that this was not at all the same thing - he just figured things out as he went and refined his skills over time in the course of doing them. He didn't necessarily remember all these things, he just started with the problems he was trying to solve, had the confidence to try things out and see if they worked, and practiced them until he got the knack of it, and then builds on that prior experience for future problems.</p>
<p>“Well yes”, I said. “How do you think I do it?”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This analogy continues to bear fruit, as I had another conversation with him recently, in which he expressed how he was impressed and surprised by how I never ran out of topics to write about. "Well, would you have trouble coming up with things to do on the Mill?", I replied. "No, I guess not." "Same thing, basically."</p>


<p>(The Mill is my parents' house. It's a converted water mill. It's lovely but also a significant amount of work)</p>


<p>I think when people think of writing, people think of it as trying to create something new in the world,
but actually most of my writing has very little creativity to its selection of topics, I'm just responding to a particular concrete thing I've encountered.</p>


<p>If you look at <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-02-09:29.html">yesterday's piece about defining things</a>, there was no primal act of creativity where I had to "come up" with a topic. I was experiencing a thing and I was annoyed about it, so I wrote about it.</p>


<p>Similarly, the day before's piece on the newsletter, <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/telegraph-your-moves">Telegraph your moves</a>, was a specific response to people's responses to some scheduling changes.</p>


<p>Both of these were very mundane prompts, but based on my own evaluation and other people's responses, they both produce pretty top tier pieces.</p>


<p>In general, life is full of problems, and even where there are no well defined problems there's a near infinite amount of detail.
Almost all of that detail you can just look at and go "Huh. What's up with that?" and write something about it.</p>


<p>For me in particular a lot of my reading and writing fits into a sort of broad intellectual program of trying to help people get better at life, for values of "people" that first and foremost includes me. As a result, in order to run out of things to write, I'd have to basically have life solved. I'm uh a little ways away from that. </p>


<p>Generally the problem I have is the opposite: There is <em>too much</em> to write about. This leads to two problems:</p>


<ol>
<li>How do I decide which bits to write about?</li>
<li>How do I write a short piece without pulling in everything?</li>
</ol>


<p>The first part is genuinely hard, and I tend towards the less deliberate: I write about whatever happens to be particularly on my mind when I sit down to write. Sometimes I have to shuffle through a few topics until something clicks, but ultimately (as per <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">How to make decisions</a>) when you've got a lot of things that could work the best way is to just pick something arbitrarily. This does result in my topics jumping around a lot, seemingly at random, but I'm OK with that and mostly don't care if other people aren't (and suspect, by and large, people enjoy the novelty factor).</p>


<p>For the second: The way I experience this is that I'm reaching into a giant tangle and tugging on a thread. I start somewhere that seems interesting (such as with a concrete problem), and as I pull related thoughts and information come along with it, constructing a linear narrative as I go. Eventually I find somewhere that feels like a natural stopping point, and I stop. Like right now.</p>
