<p class="subtitle">People are bad at defining things</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm currently reading a philosophy book, and as a result I am cranky about definitions.
Like everyone who is not a mathematician (or culturally basically a mathematician, such as a computer scientist or theoretical physicist),
philosophers are very bad at defining their terms. The key sin of philosophers is that they love doing it anyway, and think they're good at it, but are for the most part terrible about it unless they've lucked into learning how to do it well from some source that wasn't a bunch of philosophers who think "language games" meant you were supposed to play language as a competitive sport where you score points for using words that nobody else understands.</p>


<p>What I mean by "definition" here, is that when you introduce a new term (or even use an existing term in a specific or unfamilar way), you need to provide people with the ability to understand your usage of it. This doesn't require a precise definition that says exactly what the term means, like a mathematician would, though if you <em>can</em> provide such a thing that is often helpful, but it does require you to introduce enough precision that people can understand what you're talking about.</p>


<p>Most people do not put in nearly enough work into defining novel terms in a way that is usable by the reader.
When you introduce a definition without adequate support, you have essentially put a road block in the reader's path until they have sufficiently understood your definition to proceed.
If you do not help them out in doing this, you have probably lost most of them as a reader,
and almost certainly many of those you retain will misunderstand your point.</p>


<h3>What a good definition is</h3>


<p>The purpose of a definition is to give people enough to grab on to to be able to understand your usage of the term.
As such, it should explain the term (see <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/">How to explain anything to anyone</a>) and give them some material to work with in developing their understanding on top of that explanation. </p>


<p>A gold standard for definitions contains all of the following characteristics:</p>


<ol>
<li>The term is well separated from surrounding text rather than buried somewhere. The mathematical convention is that we typically have a bolded "<strong>Definition:</strong>" in front of it, often with a number you can refer back to.</li>
<li>It provides an explanation of <em>why we need the term</em>.</li>
<li>It provides an intuitive handle on the term.</li>
<li>It provides as precise an explanation of what the term means as is reasonable.</li>
<li>It is accompanied by at least one <em>positive example</em>, an example of a thing that satisfies the definition, with an explanation of why it is an example.</li>
<li>It is accompanied by at least one <em>negative example</em>, an example of a thing that is close to satisfying the definition but doesn't, with an explanation of why it is not an example.</li>
</ol>


<p>Of these, the examples are in many ways the most important and the most overlooked.</p>


<h3>An example of a bad definition</h3>


<p>In contrast the way most people do it is they shove a new term somewhere in the middle of a paragraph, gesture vaguely at what they mean by it, and then go on to use it in ways that completely fail to track the limited sense in which they've defined it.</p>


<p>The definition that I am currently being cranky about comes from Albert Borgmann's is as follows:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The early scientific theories of the Western world had both world-articulating and world-explaining significance. To articulate something, i.e., to outline and highlight the crucial features of something is also a kind of explanation. It is the kind of explanation that can satisfy the request for an explanation of a concrete thing or event. I will call it deictic explanation to distinguish it from deductive-nomological or subsumptive explanation.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>If I am being very very charitable, this just about satisfies (2) and (4). It explains why we need the term (it distinguishes a type of explanation that is different from the sort we are considering in the context of a modern scientific explanation), and it more or less defines it as being the sort of explanation that you get by outlining and highlighting th ecrucial features of something. Fair enough.</p>


<p>Anyway, on the very next page this is how the word deictic is used:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>They do have deictic power in the sense of delimiting a set of possible worlds and ruling out certain impossible worlds. We can observe a similar pattern in the development from alchemy by way of chemistry to nuclear physics. Alchemy reflected in its laws a definite world of a limited number of stuffs and transformative forces and processes. Nuclear physics. being a microtheory, allows for an indefinite number of molar worlds.</p>
<p>This pattern in the progress of science has no a priori character. It is an empirical fact that the world can be explained in the powerful scientific theories that we now have. The pace of the discoveries of these theories is a matter of historical fact. But given these two facts, it was inevitable that the deictic power of the sciences waned and all but vanished. This is not a failure of science. Nor is it the case that the deictic achievement of the earlier sciences was unquestionable or unique. Art has always been the supreme deictic discipline. Art in turn has sometimes been one with philosophy, religion, and politics; at other times these disciplines have complemented or competed with one another as disciplines of deictic explanation.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This subsequent usage <em>very</em> much makes me question whether I have understood his meaning.</p>


<p>As near as I can tell, "deictic" means something along the lines of "indexical", which means something along the lines of "pointing to a specific thing" (thanks to <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">a literal banana for explaining this</a>). Something is deictic to the degree that it concerns a specific thing in all its glory, in contrast to something being apodeictic. An explanation is deictic to the degree that it is focused on explaining <em>a particular thing</em> and what is interesting about it specifically, while it is apodeictic to the degree that it is focused on explaining <em>a general phenomenon</em> and the conditions under which it emerges.</p>


<p>Maybe. I can't tell for sure, because he doesn't provide me with any concrete examples to test this. Certainly I would very much not have thought of philosophy or religion as at all examples of things prone to deictic explanations. Art I will grant, certainly, and politics certainly is full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked problems</a>, which by their nature require attention to the specifics of the unique thing involved.</p>


<p>All of this confusion would easily have been cleared up with some examples and a bit more spelling out of his meaning.</p>


<h3>An example of a good definition</h3>


<p>In contrast, I think the following definition from Bernard Suits's "The Grasshopper", is very good:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude]. I also offer the following simpler and, so to speak, more portable version of the above: playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This has both the precise definition and the intuitive handle on it. It then goes on for several pages more to investigate how this does and doesn't apply to specific examples, which I won't include here. It doesn't have a mathematician's "<strong>Definition:</strong>" preamble, but that wouldn't really fit the style of the book, and it's still its own paragraph.</p>


<h3>Appropriate levels of precision</h3>


<p>In my gold standard for "good definition" I said "It provides as precise an explanation of what the term means as is reasonable".
The reason for the "as is reasonable" clause is that it is rarely the case that one can define something perfectly precisely,
at least outside of the realm of mathematics or constrained rule based environments (e.g. laws, rituals, games).</p>


<p>In reality many things cannot be this precisely defined, and we need more example-based (philosophers would say "ostensive") and sketch explanations. For example I can't really define "red" for you, but I can tell you that red is a colour (hopefully you don't need me to define "colour", because I'd really struggle with this one) and then point at examples of things that are red and things that are not red until you get the picture.</p>


<p>This is particularly common when you start talking about people, as people are reliably messy and complicated, and it becomes hard to precisely define a term rigorously. That's fine. We can still talk usefully about things like "love" without answering the question "What is love?", it just requires us to be a bit more careful about how we do it, and how we use examples. It may also require us to talk around a bit more about what we do and don't mean.</p>


<p>For an example of why one might need to do this, a question that came up in discussion recently is "What does 'unconditional' mean in 'unconditional love'?". It turned out everyone was using it differently (e.g. does it refer to how the love would change if circumstances change, or is it a character of the type of love felt in the moment?). This is the sort of confusion that comes up in the absence of a sufficiently precise definition. We cannot always solve it with that better definition, but we do need to navigate it.</p>


<p>This ties in to the question of teaching tacit knowledge that I talked about in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-teach-the-local-style">How to teach the local style</a>. These definitions cannot perfectly capture the thing you want to convey, but you can get the rough idea, and you can correct any errors along the way.</p>


<p>One thing that I think is important is that when you've introduced something this way you need to hold people's hands more when you use the term. Every time it comes up in future is an opportunity to refine their understanding of it, and it's worth taking many of those opportunities.</p>


<h3>How bad definitions thrive</h3>


<p>Why do so few people meet my standards of good definitions?</p>


<p>I think, primarily, people write bad definitions for the following reasons:</p>


<ol>
<li>Nobody taught them how to write good definitions, because the practice is so rare outside of mathematicians (and also nobody teaches mathematicians to do it well, they just hope they pick it up by example like everything else important in mathematics).</li>
<li>Writing good definitions is much harder work than defining things badly.</li>
<li>Writing good definitions will often reveal that the emperor has no clothes and you're using big words for no goddamn good reason to make yourself sound clever.</li>
</ol>


<p>I'm hoping in this essay I have done at least some small part to offset the first, although it probably needs a longer essay with more worked examples and better explanations of the various moving parts to really work for that.</p>


<p>The second is, in fact, good. Writing definitions <em>should</em> be hard, because every time you introduce a new term (even when you introduce it well!) you are asking the reader to do a bunch of work, and significantly harming their ability to understand your text. Often the best way to define something is to figure out a way to not need it at all, and where you do need it it's worth putting in the work to make sure that people can actually use it.</p>


<p>The third is, I think, the most pernicious. I'm a big fan of Michael Billig's "Learn to write badly: How to succeed in the social sciences". I tried to find some good excerpts to include here, but it's not actually all that well suited to excerpting. In short, he argues that much of the use of jargon and technical terms in the social sciences is of an imprecise sort that <em>cannot</em> be defined precisely in this way, because that would lose its social function, which is more about marketing your ideas and protecting them from criticism than it is about carefully and helpfully communicating them.</p>


<p>Charitably, I don't think most people are deliberately leaning into this incentive, but I do think many people are innocently writing in a style that these incentives have shaped, and demanding clear communication is a good way to push back on those incentives.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A round-tripping problem with expected utility theory</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-06-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>For reasons, I've been thinking about subjective expected utility theory and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem</a> ("the VNM theorem" for short) recently.
I have some significant philosophical objections to subjective expected utility and I'm going to explore a few of them in a series of notebook posts. This post is about an interesting thing I noticed while trying to articulate those objections.
I don't necessarily expect it to persuade anyone of anything.</p>


<p>The problem is this: The VNM theorem loses information. You cannot actually reconstruct the original decision procedure from the output of the VNM theorem, because the VNM theorem's output isn't quite what it's usually framed as.</p>


<p>The VNM theorem is as follows: Suppose you have a set of outcomes \(\mathcal{O} = \{O_1, \ldots, O_n\}\).
A lottery \(L\) is a random variable in \(\mathcal{O}\).</p>


<p>An agent has preferences over lotteries, expressed by a preorder \(\preceq\) and an indifference relation \(\sim\).
That is \(L \preceq L'\) means that \(L'\) is at least as good as \(L\), and \(L \sim L'\) means the agent is indifferent between them.</p>


<p>The VNM theorem is that under certain reasonableness conditions, this preorder must be expressible in terms of a utility function \(u: \mathcal{O} \to \mathbb{R}\), such that \(L \preceq L'\) if and only if \(E(u(L)) \leq E(u(L'))\). i.e. we prefer a lottery if it has a higher expected utility, and are indifferent between two lotteries with the same expected utility.</p>


<p>It's instructive to sketch the proof of this theorem:</p>


<p>Because we have a total order over outcomes, there is a best outcome and a worst outcome. Call them \(B\) and \(W\) respectively. If \(B \sim W\) then we're necessarily indifferent between all lotteries, so assume \(W \prec B\).
Now, consider the family of lotteries \(M_p\) such that \(M_p\) is \(B\) with probability \(p\) and \(W\) with probability \(1 - p\). So \(M_1 = B\) and \(M_0 = W\).</p>


<p>Let \(L\) be some lottery. We must have \(M_0 = W \preceq L \preceq B = M_1\).
Therefore (by the hypotheses of the theorem) we can find some \(p\) in the middle such that \(M_p \sim L\).
Some computation shows that this number \(p\) behaves like an expected value.</p>


<p>Thus the VNM theorem gives us the expected utility of an arbitrary lottery. Right?</p>


<p>Except, it doesn't. It guarantees that this expected utility exists, but it does not actually give us a way to compute it.
The hypothesis of the VNM theorem is that there is some point at which the switchover to indifference happens, but we are not given an oracle which computes that probability, only a guarantee of its existence.</p>


<p>Instead what we have to do is turn our oracle for preferences into a sort of mathematical root finding algorithm to find increasingly fine grained approximations to \(p\). We construct a sequence of approximations \(q_k \leq p \leq r_k\) by setting \(q_0 = 0\), \(r_0 = 1\), then to calculate \(q_{k+1}, r_{k+q}\) we set \(s_k = \frac{q_k + r_k}{2}\) and then asking whether \(M_{s_k} \preceq L\). If yes, we set \(q_{k + 1} = r_k, r_{k + 1} = s_k\), if no we set \(q_{k + 1} = s_k, r_{k + 1} = r_k\).</p>


<p>There is no guarantee that this process will ever terminate - the numbers for which it terminates are precisely the dyadic rationals, the integers divided by some power of two, so for example if \(p = \frac{1}{3}\) it will go on forever, producing increasingly good approximations. You can design other divide and conquer schemes - there's nothing special about this particular one - but they will all have this problem of there being some utility values that this doesn't converge to.</p>


<p>(Honesty compels me to admit that this problem goes away if you insist that probabilities and utilities have to be rational numbers, because you can design a divide and conquer scheme that just enumerates all of the rationals between the current bounds. For technical reasons that I will not go into here I find this a fundamentally unsatisfying conclusion, but the short version is that the real numbers are a better approximation to the problems of physical measurement than the rational numbers are)</p>


<p>Which is fine, in practical terms you will very rarely need to know your utility to the last decimal place, but the interesting thing to note is this: Given access to a procedure that provides these increasingly fine grained approximations to the expected utility, you cannot actually recreate the original decision procedure with a process that is guaranteed to terminate.</p>


<p>The problem is this: Suppose we have some procedure that calculates a relationship \(\preceq'\) based on such converging approximate utilities. We want \(\preceq'\) to be identical with \(\preceq\), so lets assume we've succeeded and see if this leads to a contradiction.</p>


<p>Let \(p\) be some number where the process doesn't terminate and ask whether \(M_p \preceq' M_p\) (using the same \(M_p\) as above). If \(\preceq'\) agrees with \(\preceq\) we will get the correct answer that \(M_p \sim' M_p\).</p>


<p>Now, look at how many steps of the approximation you had to compute in order to get to that point, say \(k\). This gives us an interval \(q_k \leq p \leq r_k\).</p>


<p>Now at this point we decided that \(M_p \sim' M_p\) based on no information other than that \(p \in [q_k, r_k]\). Therefore for any other \(s \in [q_k, r_k]\) we would also decide that \(M_p \sim M_s\) (because we can't tell based on what we've computed that \(p \neq s\)). But in our original relationship we must have \(M_p \prec M_s\) or \(M_s \prec M_p\), because their utilities are \(p\) and \(s\) respectively. Therefore we have failed to recreate \(\preceq\) from the output of the VNM theorem.</p>


<p>Why is this interesting?</p>


<p>Well, mostly it's interesting because this looks exactly like my normal objections to the VNM theorem, but normally I justify it on practical grounds: You run into <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredkin%27s_paradox">Fredkin's paradox</a> (a term I've only recently learned - I've always thought of this as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass">Buridan's ass problem</a>), where the amount of work you have to do to decide goes to infinity as you approach points of indifference.
From a practical viewpoint where you have all sorts of measurement and approximation problems,
this is (to me) obviously a problem with the theory, which is generally handwaved away by the setup:
The VNM theorem basically starts by saying "OK so first assume you're omniscient..." which is what allows it to start by assuming that you have this decision procedure.</p>


<p>The interesting thing about this result is that the VNM theorem runs into this problem even on its own terms, without introducing any additional assumptions of physical reasonableness (unless you count "cannot run a literally infinite amount of computation"). The VNM theorem starts from an omniscient decision procedure and constructs a utility function, but you cannot run that process backwards from the utility function to such a decision procedure because of precisely the sorts of limitations that meant that you couldn't really have constructed that procedure in the first place. </p>

<p class="subtitle">Remastery Training</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-04-19</dd>
</dl>


<p>I play a lot of Slay the Spire.</p>


<p>Slay the Spire is a game where you build up a deck of cards, which you use to fight a series of battles of varying difficulty.</p>


<p>You ascend through the levels of the spire, until at the end of the game you attempt to defeat its heart.</p>


<p>The game is divided into four acts, at the end of each of which you fight a boss.</p>


<p>The heart is the boss of the fourth act.</p>


<p>To get to Act 4, you must collect three keys before the end of Act 3.</p>


<p>If you do not, the game ends early, with "Victory?" instead of "Victory"</p>


<p>Slay the Spire has four characters, Ironclad, Silent, Defect, and Watcher.</p>


<p>My preference goes Defect, Ironclad, Silent, Watcher, from favourite to least favourite.</p>


<p>Slay the Spire has a series of difficulties called "Ascension levels".</p>


<p>Ascension levels go from 0 to 20.</p>


<p>You start at Ascension 0, and every time you complete Act 3 on an ascension level, you unlock the next one for that character.</p>


<p>I would like to be able to defeat the heart on Ascension 20 with each character.</p>


<p>So far I have managed this only with Defect.</p>


<p>I am currently working on defeating the heart on Ascension 20 with Ironclad.</p>


<p>My current, more modest, goal is to defeat Act 3, but so far I have not even been able to manage that.</p>


<p>This is somewhat frustrating.</p>


<p>I've tried quite a few times at this point.</p>


<p>Probably not more than 10, but still.</p>


<p>The problem is that I am no longer getting better at it, at least not very quickly.</p>


<p>I have identified a strategy that would likely allow me to beat the heart, but I am very bad at it.</p>


<p>To tell you about this strategy, I must first tell you about relics.</p>


<p>Relics are items you acquire as you ascend the spire, which modify your abilities.</p>


<p>Each character has a starter relic, unique to them.</p>


<p>The Ironclad's starter relic is called "burning blood", and it heals you slightly at the end of each fight.</p>


<p>One way to think about this is that it makes the game slightly easier, without making your character more powerful.</p>


<p>This is not entirely right, but it's pretty close.</p>


<p>At the beginning of the game, you encounter Neow, who offers you a blessing.</p>


<p>One of the blessings you can get is to swap your starter relic for a random boss relic.</p>


<p>Boss relics are very different from the Ironclad starter relic, in that most of them make the game harder while also making your character more powerful.</p>


<p>Anyway, I noticed that I was never taking boss relic swap, because I liked the Ironclad starter relic too much.</p>


<p>This suggested that my way through Ascension 20 might be to learn to boss relic swap on Ironclad.</p>


<p>I tried this, and I died badly every time, because Ascension 20 is too hard for me to experiment on.</p>


<p>So I went back down to Ascension 0.</p>


<p>But even with the boss relic swap, Ascension 0 is very easy for me now.</p>


<p>Slay the Spire is not an easy game, so a year or two ago this would have been inconceivable, but I've played more than 600 hours of it since then.</p>


<p>I'm not <em>amazing</em> at the game, but I'm quite good at it and, as a result, I can all but sleepwalk my way through Ascension 0, even with the harder tactics.</p>


<p>So I decided that it wasn't enough for me to just beat act 3, I had to beat the heart to advance.</p>


<p>The idea being that I have to learn to overshoot my goal.</p>


<p>This starts to be at least a little difficult, even at the lower ascension levels.</p>


<p>Enough that I have to pay attention, certainly.</p>


<p>This approach lets me take advantage of the tighter feedback loops at lower ascension levels to focus on the parts of the game that I am still bad at.</p>


<p>It removes slack. </p>


<p>As a result I must be consistently good to progress, instead of just lucky.</p>


<p>I will still progress by luck to some degree, because the game is hard enough that if you get unlucky you can die, even at lower ascension levels.</p>


<p>But luck can only get you so far, and the changes I have made force me to develop more consistent skill.</p>


<p>This is a bit like an idea called Mastery Training.</p>


<p>Mastery Training is an approach where in order to learn something, you must master what comes before it.</p>


<p>For example, requiring an A in all the prerequisite courses before you're allowed to take a course.</p>


<p>This isn't always a good idea.</p>


<p>I suspect it's often a bad idea.</p>


<p>But what I'm doing here is an interesting variant of it.</p>


<p>It is not mastery, but remastery.</p>


<p>I have "completed the course" that is Ascensions 0 through 19.</p>


<p>And now I'm retaking them, but with additional constraints, and trying to retake them at a higher level.</p>


<p>I am relearning "familiar subjects" with the goal of getting an A in them this time.</p>


<p>The theory being that what is holding me back from progressing past my current level might be a lack of consistency at the foundations.</p>


<p>This seems like a good general lesson to apply.</p>


<p>When we are stuck, start again from the beginning, but this time you have to do it <em>right</em>.</p>


<p>You have a clear path you walked before.</p>


<p>You know the way.</p>


<p>But now you must walk it again.</p>


<p>This time carrying weights.</p>


<p>Or paying careful attention to how you place your feet.</p>


<p>Perhaps we should do this more generally?</p>


<p>When we have something that is too hard, we replace it with something that is too easy, but done differently.</p>


<p>For example, when we have reached a point where we feel our writing has plateaued, we start again with simpler writing, but done differently.</p>


<p>Perhaps with a writing exercise where we change the cadence of our writing.</p>


<p>And talk about mundane subjects.</p>


<p>And use this to practice our voice, or our editing.</p>


<p>You know, hypothetically.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Some Theory of Test-Case Reduction</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-01-19</dd>
</dl>


<p>There's a bunch of test-case reduction theory that mostly lives in my head and currently-abandoned paper drafts.
I'm doing a week of PhD related writing so I thought it would be good to write up a dump of these ideas here.</p>


<p>A test-case reducer is something that is designed to take an interesting test case and make it "simpler" in some sense while retaining the property of interest.</p>


<p>Formally, a test-case reducer on some set of test-cases \(T\) is a function \(\{r : \{(U, x) : x \in U \subseteq T\} \to T\) such that \(r(U, x) \in U\). The set \(\{(U, x) : x \in U \subseteq T\}\) is called the set of reduction problems on \(T\).</p>


<p>The first argument to the reducer is the interestingness test (the set of interesting test cases) and the second is some interesting test case that we want to reduce.</p>


<p>A partial order \(\preceq\) is a reduction order for \(r\) (or \(r\) is a reducer for \(\preceq\)) if \(r(U, x) \preceq x\).
The reduction order captures what we mean by saying that a reducer makes the test case "simpler". A test case is simpler if it's smaller in the reduction order.</p>


<p>(It's hopefully faily uncontroversial that the "simpler" relationship should be a partial order - it's basically to avoid cycles where sometimes \(x\) reduces to \(y\) and sometimes \(y\) reduces to \(x\) depending on the interestingness test. It's easy to construct reducers that do have these cycles, so not every reducer has a reduction order, but generally I think those reducers are badly designed)</p>


<p>As I mentioned in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-01-01-11:22.html">Basic Reducer Design</a> I generally prefer the reduction order to be a total order.
There's no reason it has to be, but there's also no reason for it not to be - any partial order can be extended to a total order, and if a function is a reducer for some partial order then it's a reducer for any extension of it.</p>


<p>One reason to prefer a total order is that if we want a test-case reducer to be normalizing (in the sense Groce et al. propose in <a href="https://www.cefns.nau.edu/~adg326/issta17.pdf">One test to rule them all</a>, that is its output does not depend on the initial test case) then it must be a total order because for any \(x, y\) we must have \(r(\{x, y\}, \cdot) = y\) or \(r(\{x, y\}, \cdot) = x\), so either \(x \preceq y\) or \(y \preceq x\).</p>


<p>One nice thing about reduction orders is that they guarantee that reducers compose nicely without undoing each other's work. Given reducers \(r_1, r_2\) we can define a composite reducer straightforwardly as \((r_1 \cdot r_2)(U, x) = r_1(U, r_2(U, x))\) - we apply \(r_2\) then we apply \(r_1\).  If \(\preceq\) is a reduction order for both of \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) then it also is for \(r_1 \cdot r_2\).</p>


<p>Without that common reduction order, you might end up in an annoying situation where \(r_2(U, x) = y\) and \(r_1(U, y) = x\). Note that you can have this even if \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) each have a reduction order but it's not the same one.</p>


<p>One thing to consider is when a reducer is "done". We say a reduction problem \((U, x)\) is fully reduced for \(r\) if \(r(U, x) = x\),
and a reducer is idempotent if \((U, r(U, x))\) is fully reduced - i.e. running the reducer twice doesn't do any more than running the reducer once.</p>


<p>Another nice feature of reduction orders is that they guarantee that you can always iterate a reducer to an idempotent fixed point (assuming the reduction order is reasonable. The technical condition we require here is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-founded_relation">well-foundedness</a> but in basically every case of interest the order has the much stronger property that \(\{y: y \preceq x\}\) is finite for any \(x\)). Given a reducer \(r\) you can define the reducer \(r^+\) where \(r^+(U, x)\) is defined by iterating the sequence \(x_0 = x\), \(x_{n + 1} = r(U, x_n)\) until you reach a fixed point. Without a reduction order you can get cycles in this sequence so it may never terminate.</p>


<p>You can also think of \(r^+\) as the fixed point of \(r\) under composition. i.e. \(r^+ = r \cdot r^+\), so we call \(r^+\) the <em>fixation</em> of \(r\).</p>


<p>By the way, these two constructs of reducer composition and fixation are not particularly abstract but are actually how reducers are built in practice.
You can think of your typical reducer as \((r_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot r_n\)^+) where the \(r_i\) are individual simpler reducers that are typically called <em>reduction passes</em>.</p>


<p>Generally speaking for a reducer we're most interested in the behaviour of \(r^+\) - what happens when you run the reducer to fixation - but it's often useful to consider reducers that are not necessarily run to fixation because of this pass structure. Anecdotally (and for solid heuristic reasons) it's generally better <em>not</em> to run each pass to fixation before running the next one:
After running a reducer once it's typically "pretty close" to fixation, and running it again is likely to be wasted effort, while if other passes have run it may have been perturbed enough that more work is useful.</p>


<p>Reasoning in terms of the fully reduced problems of a reducer also gives us another useful notion, which is that of reducer strength. We can say \(r_1\) is at least as strong as \(r_2\) if every reduction problem that is fully reduced for \(r_1\) is also fully reduced for \(r_2\) (and stronger if also there are some reduction problems that are fully reduced for \(r_2\) that are not for \(r_1\)).</p>


<p>This is a slightly weaker notion of strength than some we might consider. It's possible for \(r_1\) to be stronger than \(r_2\) but to sometimes have \(r_2(U, x) \prec r_1(U, x)\), because \(r_1\) took a path that causes it to get stuck at a worse point.</p>


<p>Under this notion of strength, \(r_1 \cdot r_2\) is at least as strong as each of \(r_1\) and \(r_2\), and \(r^+\) is equally strong to \(r\).</p>
