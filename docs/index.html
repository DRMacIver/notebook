<p class="subtitle">Habit Overload</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-16</dd>
</dl>


<p>Attention Conservation Notice: Personal debugging. May be of interest if you have similar problems, which you probably do, but I've not made any particular effort to generalise it into a coherent point.</p>


<p>I've been noticing recently that a lot of my recurring habits have been slipping,
so I'm attempting to take stock of this and try to figure out what to do about it.</p>


<p>I think the problem has a couple of roots:</p>


<ol>
<li>I'm trying to do too much. There's plenty of time to do all the habits if I do nothing else, and even if I do a reasonable amount of work on my PhD, but the reality is that I don't do a reasonable amount of work on my PhD because my two modes are "not really doing enough work on it" and "total all consuming obsession", and the latter tends to impinge on the habits and make me feel bad about neglecting them.</li>
<li>Some of the habits probably weren't working that well for me.</li>
<li>Some of the habits have lost cues that were previously helpful for keeping on top of them.</li>
<li>My planning system became lightly aversive because it was trying to keep me on track despite the above fighting against me.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think this can mostly be solved by taking stock a bit of what's reasonable, and deciding what habits to drop and what to keep, and part of that is looking at what's not working and dropping or modifying it based on where it fits into the above.</p>


<p>For example I've dropped my <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1283138137129193472">daily paper reading habit</a> because I decided it wasn't working that well for me - it felt high overhead (because I had to decide to read) and low value (I'd be better served chatting on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3DkPGuAZiGbeNYlwje6jTlFxz9peIGnjSuZTwF4NGM/edit?usp=sharing">Weird CS Theory Discord</a>) or reading a book.</p>


<p>Another example is that I had a habit of rereading bits of books I'd previously read every day. I've almost entirely dropped that, not deliberately. I think I'm going to formally drop that - doing book driven posts on here fills the same need.</p>


<p>I've also, for the moment, dropped my planning system (which was coping board based). It's a good system and I want to get back to it but I think I need to leave some time for my life to normalise into a new routine before I bring it back, and right now it has a bit of guilt attached to it, so I've thrown away the cards and will resume when it feels right to do so.</p>


<p>Another thing that's been a problem is that I've been reading much less recently. This is I think a loss of a cue - I previously started reading during my morning coffee, which put me in the right mindset for the rest of the day and I would read more later as and when the mood struck me. Recently I've been doing morning pages during morning coffee, which is great and is a high value habit that I will absolutely retain, but robs me of that cue. I've started finishing morning pages by doing at least five minutes of reading, which I'm hoping will help with that.</p>


<p>This notebook itself is, of course, one of the daily habits. For the moment I don't plan to drop it as such - I get a lot of value out of it, and I think other people do. Recently it's become a bit erratic and lower quality I think, but it's in the nature of a daily writing practice that that will happen. I might however start skipping days where I've otherwise been doing a lot of writing, or otherwise make some minor modifications to it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Nice Problems to Have</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-15</dd>
</dl>


<p>I've been thinking about "nice problems to have" as a phenomenon recently. I have a feeling they're widely misunderstood.</p>


<p>My standard response to the concept has often been "Yes but nice problems to have are still problems", but actually I think it goes deeper than that: Nice problems to have are also rarely actually nice to have. The phrase is misleading.</p>


<p>What we generally mean when we say "nice problem to have" is that the <em>preconditions</em> for having this problem are nice to have. i.e. you cannot have this problem unless some other nice thing happens first.
This is not at all a reliable predictor of the amount of suffering involved.</p>


<p>Consider, for example, having all your friends and family constantly making demands on you, far beyond your capacity to satisfy, to the point where it would be emotionally exhausting even if you could say yes to everyone but also you have to say no to most of them and they will resent you for it.
This is obviously an intensely painful problem, right?</p>


<p>Now suppose it's because you come from poverty and have landed a well paid job. Suddenly it's a "nice problem to have" (you have it because you're being well paid! Being well paid is good!), but that doesn't change how miserable it is.</p>


<p>The thing is, by definition, "nice problems to have" are ones that are not going to be shared by a lot of people (otherwise the preconditions would just be normal behaviour and it wouldn't be a nice problem to have).
As a result:</p>


<ol>
<li>Most people probably won't be able to relate to it, because their lived experiences will be so different.</li>
<li>People will be envious of you for the nice thing.</li>
</ol>


<p>Thus the defining characteristic about nice problems to have is not that they are nice, but that you will be afforded no sympathy for having them. Nice problems to have are the opposite of nice: They isolate you from the ability to <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-should-complain-about-it">complain about them</a>, which removes a major bonding activity with people who have not been successful in the same way as you, and also causes you to feel worse about the problems with those who do not share your burden.</p>


<p>There is a phenomenon of people succeeding and leaving their former friends behind, and there are many very bad reasons why people do this, but I suspect the nice problems to have issue is one of them: None of their former friends are able to be remotely sympathetic to things that are very real sources of their suffering (and indeed that unrelatability of it is probably <em>part</em> of their suffering).</p>


<p>This is in many ways a variant of the <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/being-deep-in-an-abstraction-stack">abstraction stack</a> problem - you need people around you who just <em>get</em> the things you want to talk about - and the solution is probably the same: Regardless of who else you hang out with (and you should hang out with a variety of people) you do need <em>some</em> people you can talk to who understand your problems, even if they're supposedly nice problems to have.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Living Room Rules</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1281131593948692480">my Twitter the other day</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>A pattern I notice over and over again: you don't have to get all of a community's norms right from day one, but you do have to get a community's norms of agreeing on community norms right from day one or your community is doomed to fall apart, probably messily.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>One of the ways in which I have seen this manifest is tech communities and the adoption of code of conducts.
Tech communities that don't have codes of conduct from very early on tend to have vicious battles when it comes to adopting them, with a lot of the existing members of the community absolutely livid about the idea that they should be held to specific rules of behaviour.
This is what happens if you build a community without building legitimacy for a mode of forming norms.</p>


<p>One way to solve this is to have a code of conduct from the beginning, and it may be worth doing this anyway (especially a generic "no racism, transphobia, etc." one), but I think using this as the main solution sets the bar too low, and there is an easier and more flexible approach that will build a healthy and functional community:
Simply declare "Le code de conduite, c'est moi". This is your space, as the founder of the community, and the people there are your guests. They should behave accordingly, and if they are not prepared to behave accordingly they are welcome to leave.</p>


<p>These are what I call <em>living room rules</em> - you are treating the space as your virtual living room. As the host you are responsible for people having a good time, and the guests are responsible for behaving well in your space.</p>


<p>Living room rules work best for small communities whose management is well within the scope of a single individual.
The reason for this is that as a single individual founder you have authority over the space, and thus over how people behave within it. Your word is law. Once authority is delegated to multiple people, the possibility of conflict exists, and the authority is weakened (this can, of course, be a good thing too).</p>


<p>A Code of Conduct is essentially a tool you can use for claiming authority over people's behaviour without possessing that authority on your own.
You, a member of the community or one of many organisers, have the ability to say "This behaviour is not on, because it says so in the code of conduct". By making the rules of the space explicit, authority to get people to conform to those rules is conferred.</p>


<p>But you can just skip that step and claim authority on your own. It's allowed, I promise. You do this every time you have your friends around for dinner (a thing that we used to do prior to 2020) and it generally works fine.</p>


<p>Why might you want to do this?</p>


<p>Well, it's more flexible and produces better results. The goal is not to get people to follow some set of rules to the letter, the goal is to get a community that behaves in a positive way. Explicit systems of rules are easy to rules lawyer, and it's hard for them to account for every scenario. That doesn't mean a code of conduct is bad in and of itself - they're on balance probably good things - but they are <em>insufficient</em> and a community where people are constantly skirting the edge of the code of conduct is one that you might as well let fail because it's basically dead anyway.</p>


<p>In contrast, when a community is small enough that you can have it overseen by a single person, that person is able to use their judgement and shape the behaviour of the community into more positive directions, and it's much harder to rules lawyer against individual personal judgement.</p>


<p>There are a couple reasons people don't want to do this:</p>


<ul>
<li>Claiming authority is kinda scary, at least if you're the sort of person worth trusting with authority. "Because I say so" is a harder thing to say than "because these reasons", even if you are the one who defined those reasons.</li>
<li>Some people are going to try hard to argue with and manipulate you to get the outcomes they want, and then you have to go through the social awkwardness of showing that person the door.</li>
<li>It's hard to do well, and it feels like a personal judgement when you don't do it well.</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm still figuring out the details of how to do it well myself, but I think the following principles are roughly what I'm trying to follow:</p>


<ul>
<li>Claim this authority explicitly and early.</li>
<li>Be explicit about the sort of space that you are trying to achieve. "This is what I want out of this space, though details may be subject to change, and I am the arbiter of whether that is being achieved."</li>
<li>Don't be an asshole with your authority (obviously), but more than that do your best to be someone who people are glad has authority. Your role here is to be the host, and to use the authority that gives you to make sure everyone has a good time.</li>
<li>When you make decisions, record them somewhere. This can evolve into a document that you can use to better define and shape your community norms. Eventually it might acquire authority in its own right, once the community starts to outgrow you.</li>
</ul>


<p>I've run a few online spaces more or less on these principles. The most explicit is my recent creation of the Weird CS Theory Community Discord, which started with me creating <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3DkPGuAZiGbeNYlwje6jTlFxz9peIGnjSuZTwF4NGM/edit?usp=sharing">a document based on these principles fairly early on</a>. Hard to say how it's going, because it's early days yet, but we've mostly got the vibe I want and the one incident which promtped the creation of the document was entirely civil even before I intervened, and the intervention was well received.</p>


<p>Should all online spaces be run this way? Absolutely not. Not even all small ones. But I do think there should be more online spaces run this way, and that many more people would benefit from running one than currently do.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Automatic Boltzmann Sampling for Context Free Grammars</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-11</dd>
</dl>


<p>A Boltzmann sampler of parameter \(x\) for some class of combinatorial objects (e.g. strings in some language) is a random sampler that picks an object of size \(n\) with probability proportional to \(x^n\).</p>


<p><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/03/fully-automated-luxury-boltzmann-sampling-for-regular-languages/">Ages ago</a> I figured out how to do Boltzmann Sampling for arbitrary regular languages, by computing the deterministic finite automaton for the language and doing some linear algebra.</p>


<p>Its major limitation was basically that it required computing the whole deterministic finite automaton, which may be exponentially large. Implicitly this also meant that it doesn't work on anything <em>other</em> than regular languages, because you have to have finitely many states.</p>


<p>Anyway, shower thought for this morning is that I can lift both these restrictions and automatically derive a Boltzmann sampler for any context free language, as long as \(|x| &lt; \frac{1}{|A|}\) (where \(x\) is the Boltzmann parameter and \(A\) is the alphabet of the language). This condition isn't too onerous and is necessary to guarantee that a Boltzmann sampler exists for any language over that alphabet, though some languages may have Boltzmann samplers with larger parameter values.</p>


<p>The technique is actually very simple: Much simpler than the previous one in some ways, although partly because the complexity lives in black boxes.</p>


<p>It works by breaking it down into two parts:</p>


<ol>
<li>Pick the size of the target string according to the right distribution.</li>
<li>Sample uniformly among strings of that size.</li>
</ol>


<p>So all we need to do is figure out how to do these things.</p>


<p>In order to do the first, let \(c(n)\) be the number of strings in the language of length \(n\).
Necessarily \(c(n) \leq |A|^n\) because there are at most \(|A|^n\) strings of length \(n\), let alone in the language.</p>


<p>The Boltzmann sampler distribution is that we pick a string of length \(n\) with probability proportional to \(c(n) x^n\).</p>


<p>We can thus pick the length as follows: Pick a real number \(z\) uniformly at random in the region \([0, B(x)]\), where \(B(x) = \sum c(n) x^n\) and choose the first \(n\) such that \(\sum\limits_{k=0}^n c(k) x^k \geq z\).</p>


<p>Unfortunately we don't know this infinite sum. You can calculate it relatively easy for some classes of language, but if the grammar for your language is ambiguous that gets harder.</p>


<p>However! We don't actually need to do that at all, because the restriction on the parameter choice allows us to create increasingly good upper bounds on this sum as follows. Because we know that \(c(n) \leq |A|^n\) we know that \(\sum\limits_{k = n}^\infty c(k) x^k \leq \frac{(|A|x)^n}{1 - |A| x}\). Thus we can define sequences \(L_n = \sum\limits_{k \leq n} c(k) x^k \) \(U_n = \frac{(|A| x)^{n + 1}}{1 - |A|x} + L_n\). These have the property that \(L_n \leq B(x) \leq U_n\), the \(L_n\) are monotonically decreasing, the \(U_n\) are monotonically decreasing, and they both converge to \(B(x)\).</p>


<p>We can now sample the size as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>Maintain a value \(m\) which we have evaluated \(L_m, U_m\) up to.</li>
<li>Pick a real number \(z\) uniformly in \([0, U_m]\).</li>
<li>If \(z \leq L_m\) then as before find and return the first \(n\) such that \(L_n \leq z\). Necessarily \(n \leq m\).</li>
<li>Otherwise, find \(m' &gt; m\) such that either \(z \leq L_{m'}\) or \(U_{m'} &lt; z\).<ol>
<li>Set \(m = m'\).</li>
<li>If \(z \leq m'\) then pick \(n\) as in (3) and stop.</li>
<li>Go back to (2), drawing a new value of \(z\) based on our new \(m\).</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>(This is a relatively well known technique for values of "relatively well known" that mean "if you work in a very niche field you've definitely heard about it" but I think I independently reinvented it a while back because I don't work in that very niche field so hadn't heard about it)</p>


<p>So that's how we pick the size. Now we are left with two problems:</p>


<ol>
<li>How do we calculate \(c(n)\)?</li>
<li>How do we pick uniformly among values of size \(n\)?</li>
</ol>


<p>The answer to both is that we use the things I've been writing about recently!</p>


<p>First, note that we can turn any context-free grammar into a deterministic <em>infinite</em> automaton by using language derivatives, as per the <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/parsing-with-derivatives/">Parsing with Derivatives</a> approach: States are labelled by a derivative of the initial grammar, and are created lazily on demand as you traverse the automaton.</p>


<p>You can now from this automaton use the same techniques I described in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-06-09:52.html">Indexing a DFA in shortlex order</a>, which work equally well on an infinite automaton (they only ever require looking a finite depth away from a given state).
This means we can easily calculate \(c(n)\) using dynamic programming as before, and we can sample uniformly from the strings of length \(c(n)\) using the same technique we used to index: Pick a random integer \(i\) in the range \([0, c(n) - 1]\) and then walk the DFA the i'th string of length \(n\) in lexicographic order.</p>


<p>One potential issue with the conversion to a DFA that this neatly avoids is that you can run into cases with context free languages where it is undecidable if the grammar contains any strings. Fortunately, for random sampling this doesn't matter! Because long strings are increasingly unlikely, there is (probabilistically speaking) no observable difference between a state that has no strings starting from it and a state that only has ridiculously long strings.</p>


<p>How practical is this? I don't know exactly, but my suspicion is that for a lot of simple grammars it will work very well. I may attempt to put together an implementation soon.</p>


<p>PS. It's likely that the parameter restriction can be lifted by making more precise estimates of the tail sums using the automaton, but I haven't quite figured out how yet. For my purposes it's generally a relatively mild restriction so I'm not that worried about it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Learning to use the system</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-10</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew">Talking About Machines</a> by Julian Orr, page 48:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>These same users, however, cannot be bothered to learn how they are supposed to use the machines. They claim they do not have time, he says. They seem to have plenty of time to stand around and bitch, though. [...] He finds this very frustrating, and the customers do not respond to his frustration.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In context, a technician is frustrated that he is constantly having to fix problems caused by the users' improper use of the machines he maintains. If the users learned how to use the machines properly, which they refuse to do, the machines wouldn't be broken so often.</p>


<p>I share both the technician's irritation and the user's reluctance to learn: The limitation is probably not time but some mix of learned helplessness (believing that it's too difficult) and managerial unwilling to budget time and money for the training needed. On the other hand, the users could certainly stand to acquire some <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2015/02/what-are-developer-adjacent-skills/">adjacent skills</a> to make the technician's life easier. Every time you encounter a problem it's worth asking the person responsible for fixing it a little bit about what caused it and what you could have done to avoid that. A lot of the time you'll forget or not be able to implement the answer, but over time you might pick up enough by osmosis to make both of your lives better.</p>


<p>On the other hand, the technician is probably underestimating just how hard it is to use the system without breaking it.
People are <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/861">operant conditioned by the systems they use</a> into using them in a way that mostly doesn't break, and experts are the ones who have experienced the most of this, so probably experience the system very differently than the users do.</p>


<p>But even experience users sometimes still seem to use the system in ways that break it.
I think part of what's going on here is that operant conditioning only works when you have the ability to learn,
and many people never acquire enough of a working model of the system to be able to learn.
If you don't know what it was you did that caused the bad result, how can you learn to avoid that?
(This is why it's important to ask questions).</p>


<p>If we want to learn to use a system, part of that is speeding up this process of operant conditioning - learning what's safe, and what to avoid.
Having an adequate mental model of the system seems to be a key part of that, because it lets you figure out this mapping of action to outcome.</p>


<p>I notice this a lot with git. There's a really huge difference in how people experience git, and it seems to largely come down to whether they have a good working model of it. git is a horrible mess of weird multipurpose arbitrary commands, and it has a number of sharp edges, but honestly for me it's basically fine and it causes me almost no problems, and it has been like that almost from day one, because I roughly know how it works and so can think of things in terms of what I'm trying to achieve in the underlying model. Without that model, you only see the external complexity, which is almost impossible to navigate.</p>


<p>Another place I've seen this is mathematics education. People try to teach maths as a bunch of facts that you have to memorise. This is basically impossible and nobody will ever learn to be a mathematician that way - they will either learn to be a mathematician on their own, they will brute force their way through some exams and then forget everything, or they will fail horribly, because without an underlying understanding of the nature of mathematics and how everything fits together it's just an unreasonable amount of pointless rules and facts to memorise and you will experience all of it as arbitrary.</p>


<p>People often seem very resistant to acquiring models of the systems they use, because that seems hard and time consuming, but the reality is that trying to use a system without some sort of model of it is much harder and will be a source of constant and bewildering suffering.</p>
