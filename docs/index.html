<p>Hillel recently wrote about <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/fd1f0758-ae31-4e83-9138-33721cbd5ce3">cross-branch testing</a> - comparing implementations of the same API in two different branches as a form of differential testing to see whether a change introduced any functional differences.
As part of his example he ended up with what was functionally the following interestingness test:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_interesting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">out</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">out</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nb">abs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">**</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">abs</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">out</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">100</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">9</span>
</pre></div>


<p>He mentions in the article that this gives nondeterministic results for Hypothesis:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Running this gives us an erroneous input:</p>
<p><code>python
   Falsifying example: test_f(
       a=5, b=6, c=5,
   )</code></p>
<p>This is nondeterministic: Iâ€™ve also gotten <code>(0, 4, 0)</code> and <code>(-114, -114, -26354)</code> as error cases.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><code>(0, 4, 0)</code> is the (probably globally) correct answer of all of these according to Hypothesis's internal reduction heuristics,
but Hypothesis's test-case reduction is unable to reliably transform all of the failing examples to it.</p>


<p>I reacted to this as I always do to such things: "Oh, I wonder if I can make the test-case reducer better". But the answer is no, no I cannot, and the reason is that this test contains what is basically a hash function (not a very good hash function, but good enough), and as a result the test cases are pretty much uniformly distributed throughout the set of test cases - if you generate test cases where the values are between <code>-10</code> and <code>10</code>, then of the <code>9261</code> possible test cases, <code>129</code> are interesting, i.e. about <code>1.4%</code> which is about what you'd expect if the computation of <code>abs(out) % 100</code> were roughly randomly distributed.</p>


<p>For such functions we end up with the slightly awkward situation where:</p>


<ol>
<li>It's not that hard to find test cases (<code>1%</code> isn't that infrequent! We can just exhaustively enumerate to find the globally minimal test case).</li>
<li>It's hard enoguh to find test cases that most test-cases are locally minimal.</li>
</ol>


<p>Suppose for a typical triple of integers we have, say, <code>10</code> reductions we can perform, and those reductions are no more likely than chance to work, then <code>90%</code> of interesting test cases are locally minimal, which means that we'll typically end the reduction process within a few steps.</p>


<p>In order to explore this, lets consider the following toy model: Our space of interesting test cases are triples of integers between <code>0</code> and <code>10</code>, and we have a local reducer that makes the following transformations:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">reduce_tuple</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">t</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>


<p>(if this doesn't make sense to you don't worry about it too much, it's just the first local reducer that came to mind for triples of integers)</p>


<p>Suppose we're reducing subject to an interesting test where the maximal value <code>(10, 10, 10)</code> is always interesting and every other test case is interesting with probability <code>p</code>. What is the probability that this local reducer finds the globally optimal test case?</p>


<p>Based on some fairly crude simulations, the local reducer starts finding the globally optimal test-case more around <code>p = 0.93</code>, which has the amusing property that the local reducer is reliably worse (in expectation) than the reducer that just always tries <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> and gives up if that doesn't work. Some equally crude simulation suggests that an approach that just enumerates the smallest test cases for a while returns at least as good a result in the same number of calls to the interestingness test.</p>


<p>I'm not sure if there's any sort of general lesson to derive here - most interestingness tests are not quite this adversarial - but I do feel like there is often something like this going on, where the reduction problem isn't that hard despite being in a local minimum, and I wonder if something loosely inspired by this that estimates the density of interesting test cases below the current interesting test case, but I'm not sure if that's entirely useful.</p>


<p>If one <em>did</em> have some sort of easy way to sample from test cases that are strictly smaller than the current interesting test case, it might be worth running that for longer than it would be intuitively obviously useful as a sort of crude but perhaps surprisingly effective reducer? It's certainly more robust to this sort of problem than any kind of local transformation based reducer would be. </p>

<p class="subtitle">Ensuring Downward Paths</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-08-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>I had some half-formed thoughts about test-case reduction that I wanted to work through, and this notebook is a place for working through half-formed thoughts, so here we go...</p>


<p>The thing I've been working on on and off for about a month now is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-05-11:29.html">using language inference to figure out new reduction passes</a>.</p>


<p>It can be thought of as a way of taking an idea that doesn't work (using L* for test case reduction) and combining it with an idea that works but doesn't generalise well (learning a table of small string substitutions to make),
and getting an idea that does work and does generalise.</p>


<p>This has me thinking: What, exactly, does it mean for an approach to test-case reduction to generalise?</p>


<p>Also <em>does</em> this approach generalise well? The big question with it is basically whether it works well when you change the interestingness test. I think it will, but it probably depends a lot on the choice of interestingness test and how close your reducer is to normalising it already.</p>


<p>In the approach to test-case reduction I favour, test-case reduction starts from set of test cases \(X\) and a total order \(\preceq\) over \(X\) called the <em>reduction order</em>,
and a test-case reducer is a function \(r(U, x)\) where \(x \in U \subseteq X\), \(r(U, x) \in U\), and \(r(U, x) \preceq x\). For me usually \(X\) is a set of strings and \(\preceq\) is the shortlex order where \(x \preceq y\) if \(|x| &lt; |y|\) or \(|x| = |y|\) and \(x \leq y\) lexicographically.</p>


<p>Your prototypical test-case reducer starts from a bunch of small-step reductions, which gives you a function \(t: X \to X^{&lt;\omega}\), where \(t(x)_i \prec x\),
and the reducer greedily tries each of \(t(x)_i\) in order. If none of them are in \(U\) it returns \(x\), otherwise it it recurses and returns \(r(U, t(x)_i)\) for the first \(i\) with \(t(x)_i \in U\).</p>


<p>More generally given such a function we might say that a reducer is \(t\)-local if it satisfies the following conditions:</p>


<ol>
<li>\(t(U, x) = x\) if and only if \(t(x)_i \not\in U\) for all \(i\).</li>
<li>For all \(U, x\) is some sequence \(x = x_0, \ldots, x_n = r(U, x)\) with \(x_{i + 1} \in t(x)_i\) (note that we don't necessarily require that \(x_i \in U\)).</li>
</ol>


<p>That is, basically a \(t\)-local reducer is one that looks like the prototypical reducer but may have some optimisations and fiddly bits. e.g. delta debugging is a \(t\) local reducer where \(t\) is maps \(x\) to all test cases that can be formed by deleting a single element of \(x\). Delta debugging starts by trying large bulk combinations of these deletions and gradually narrows it down until it's only trying the small ones. Another approach which uses the same \(t\) but a different algorithm is what I've called <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/06/adaptive-delta-debugging/">adaptive delta debugging</a>.</p>


<p>Most reducers implemented in practice are roughly \(t\)-local for some \(t\) (often they fail to be \(t\)-local in some cases because they hit some internal limit and stop when they could be making more progress, and rerunning the reducer may produce further redctions) and I think this is good because it allows you to reason in terms of what transformations they are capable of performing.</p>


<p>So lets assume we have a \(t\)-local reducer. What makes it good?</p>


<p>Basically the tradeoff is this:</p>


<ol>
<li>The larger \(|t(x)|\) tends to be the better you will reduce \(x\).</li>
<li>The smaller \(|t(x)|\) is the better your reducer tends to perform.</li>
</ol>


<p>The ideal seems to be that you want \(|t(x)| = O(|x|)\), as per delta debugging, and the trick is to tweak the set within that constraints to try to get good results.</p>


<p>(Note that having \(|t(x)| = O(|x|)\) doesn't mean that the overall reducer runs in \(O(|x|)\) - even if you reduce the size at every step you can easily be made to make \(O(|x|^2)\) membership checks, and if you just make lexicographic transformations it's easy for performance to get exponentially bad)</p>


<p>The problem that you run into is that basically what you really want is not just for \(|t(x)|\) to be large, but for it to contain values that are in some sense "likely to be in \(U\)". One way this can fail to happen is when there is some sort of precondition on the range of \(U\) we are interested in. The biggest example of this is when interesting test cases have to be syntactically valid according to some grammar. When this happens, effectively you are censoring \(t\) by replacing it with its syntactically valid subset. Often when something like delta debugging gets stuck it's not because it's not because of any intrinsic limitation related to the interestingness test, it's just ended up at a point where \(t(x)\) contains no syntactically valid test-cases.</p>


<p>So, essentially what we want in order to get a good reducer for a format is to try to ensure that \(t(x)\) is always well populated with <em>syntactically valid</em> reductions of \(x\). </p>


<p>One way to do this might be to artificially construct interestingness tests that are basically designed to expose small reductions. I'm not quite sure what those would be. One thing I was thinking of is having interestingness tests of where \(x\) is interesting if \(y \preceq x\) for some fixed \(y\), then once those are normalised gradually "censor" the tests by removing all intermediate parts, stopping when you can't learn anything other than the direct jump to \(y\).</p>


<p>This can be thought of as ensuring that whenever the final reduced result is \(y\) you have as rich a set of paths leading to it as the learning process is possibly able to find.</p>


<p>I don't yet know how likely this is to work. I'm planning to do more experiments soon on getting this running on hypothesis-csmith and we'll see how well it can learn that, but I think there's some interesting stuff to investigate here.</p>

<p class="subtitle">From a Certain Point of View</p>

<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3fiWsnC">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</a> by Susanna Clarke, page 480:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Artists are tricky fellows, sir, forever reshaping the world according to some design of their own," said Strange. "Indeed they are not unlike magicians in that."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>A thing I often think about is the blurry line between true and useful, communication and performance.</p>


<p>In the context of the story, this is about visual art, but the same happens with the written or spoken word: When we attempt to convey facts, we end up summarising, simplifying, focusing on what we think is important about it, and often when we do this we end up saying things that are not, in the strictest sense, true.</p>


<p>(In context, Norrell is complaining about a painting that has a mirror where there is none).</p>


<p>Sometimes this is because we elide crucial details. Sometimes it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children">lie-to-children</a>. Sometimes it's to give the story the true aesthetic without the elaborate scaffolding needed to convey that aesthetic accurately (the mirror).
Sometimes, of course, it's just a lie.</p>


<p>I think we end up doing this more than we think, because memory is more fallible than we like to treat it as, and we tend to think more in terms of aesthetic and narrative than detailed recollection of facts. In this sense we are all artists.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Standardised Facts</p>

<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZB2wmE">Seeing Like a State</a> by James C. Scott, page 80:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>State simplifications have at least five characteristics that deserve emphasis. Most obviously, state simplifications are observations of only those aspects of social life that are of official interest. They are <em>interested</em>, utilitarian facts. Second, they are also nearly always written (verbal or numerical) <em>documentary</em> facts. Third, they are typically <em>static</em> facts. Fourth, most stylized state facts are also <em>aggregate</em> facts. Aggregate facts may be impersonal (the density of transportation networks) or simply a collection of facts about individuals (employment rates, literacy rates, residence patterns). Finally, for most purposes, stateofficials need to group citizens in ways that permit them to make a collective assessment. Facts that can be aggregated and presented as averages or distributions must therefore by <em>standardized</em> facts. However unique the actual circumstances of the various individuals who make up the aggregate, it is their sameness or, more precisely, their differences along a standardized scale or continuum that are of interest.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is a very interesting passage that I think I probably just nodded and skimmed over when first reading this book. I find that often the random page approach is a good way of highlighting such passages.</p>


<p>I don't have a huge amount to say about this passage right now (because I'm ill and it's hot and as a result I am quite stupid today) but I feel like it's especially relevant right now during the COVID-19 epidemic, where we're seeing a lot of this sort of thing. Death rates, hospitalisation rates, etc. are very much an example of standardised facts, and are eliding a lot of the weird and very unpleasant ways in which people's COVID-19 symptoms differ.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Politics as long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-30</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2yvyoOw">Democracy in Small Groups</a> by John Gastil, page 145:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Consensus and democracy didn't always work to the satisfaction of the faculty and students at the Meeting School. Even as students obtained ever-greater power, they remaind reluctant to deal with many important issues.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think an under-appreciated constraint on the running of human civilisation is just how incredibly boring well-functioning politics is. (2020 politics is of course, sadly, not boring).</p>


<p>Worse, it manages to be simultaneously:</p>


<ul>
<li>Incredibly Boring</li>
<li>Extremely detailed</li>
<li>Highly Stressful</li>
<li>Utterly Vital</li>
</ul>


<p>I feel like this is a combination of factors that a democratic process is almost uniquely poorly suited for, which is I guess why we end up delegating so much of the running of a country to its civil service.</p>


<p>But there end up being all sorts of things which have these properties and you <em>can't</em> delegate to a civil service, because they require actual policy decisions, and I feel like we don't really have a good handle on how those work (or, at least <em>I</em> don't have a good handle on how those work. Is there some sort of ethnographic study of the UK parliament I could read?).</p>


<p>The worst combination seems to happen when a decision <em>requires</em> an understanding of all these boring details, but people who are not willing to believe that have democratic oversight over the decision anyway.
This is basically how you end up with Brexit.</p>


<p>On the other hand, I know enough about how the sausage is made that I wouldn't want a country run entirely by the civil service either (I admit I might still prefer this to the current lot). Experts are, ultimately, still people, and those people <em>do</em> in some way need to be aligned with the wishes of the populace, at least to the degree that those wishes are reality-based and not actively murderous.</p>


<p>(OK, maybe I <em>don't</em> want much democracy in the UK, as we seem to be pretty bad at both halves of that)</p>


<p>I don't have any sort of solution here. I often describe the problem of how to coordinate large groups of people whose interests are only weakly mutually aligned as the fundamental problem of civilisation, so it's not surprising that I'm not going to solve it in a dashed off notebook post, but I do feel like managing this boredom aspect is more important than I had previously realised.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, currently we manage the boredom of politics by getting increasingly frustrated with it and, as a result, eventually deciding to make politics exciting, and that doesn't go so well. </p>
