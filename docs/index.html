<p>From Lois McMaster Bujold's "A Civil Campaign", page 137:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Madame Vorsoisson", Mark said with dignity, "is a very sensible woman. When presented with compelling facts, <em>she</em> doesn't let a thoughtless emotional response overcome her clear reason."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"A Civil Campaign" is probably my favourite book in the Vorkosigan series. The Vorkosigan series is largely an "Adventures! In! Space!" series, but as it goes on there's increasingly fewer adventures in favour of exploring the lives of the characters.</p>


<p>Adventures in A Civil Campaign primarily center on a number of things:</p>


<ol>
<li>Planning for the imperial wedding.</li>
<li>Miles (the protagonist of the series) attempting to woo the aforementioned Madame Vorsoisson, with a thoroughly inappropriately military approach.</li>
<li>Mark (Miles's clone/brother) attempting an early stage biotech startup.</li>
<li>Many exciting politics as a hereditary patriarchal nobility adjusts to things like gene tests and gender changes.</li>
<li>Probably some other things I'm forgetting.</li>
</ol>


<p>This exchange is about the third. Mark has just fed Ekaterin (Madame Vorsoisson) some of his startup's food product. It is a vaguely pleasing but mostly a bit bland product that I imagine as being a bit like cream cheese.
The product is nutritious, flexible, cheap to produce, and has significant environmental benefits.
It should be a miracle product that will make Mark extremely successful.</p>


<p>Also it comes from bugs. The bugs are particularly disgusting looking. They call it bug butter. The bugs are called butter bugs.</p>


<p>Also, they're trying to sell their product made from genetically engineered bugs on a planet that regards mutations with visceral horror.</p>


<p>Ekaterin has, kindly, reacted primarily to the quality of the bug butter as a food product rather than its origins. Miles and everyone else have reacted with horror to the name, the branding, and the general visceral association of the food product with its origins (it's vomited up by horrifying bug creatures).</p>


<p>Mark believes that Ekaterin is in the right and that Miles and the others are in the wrong. Mark is wrong. Mark is bad at startups.</p>


<p>Oh, Ekaterin is of course behaving very well. It's <em>good</em> to be able to suspend emotional reactions and look at the potential in a situation. However, Mark is conflating how he feels people <em>should</em> react to his product with how people are actually going to react to his product. Miles and everyone else are providing him with valuable insight.</p>


<p>Mark does eventually turn this around, mostly because of Ekaterin's help on branding, but without her he would have been insisting that people are reacting to his actions <em>wrong</em> and complaining about the unfairness of it all.</p>


<p>This is an easy trap to fall in to, both in startups and in general: If people react badly to your actions that <em>might</em> be unfair, and it's legitimate to feel aggrieved about it, but ultimately at some point you need to ask whether you want to have an impact or not, and if you want to have an impact it's usually better to ask how you can effectively work with people's reactions.</p>


<p>It's all very well to demand that people react to your actions differently, but it doesn't usually work. If you want to change the world, if you want people to use your product, you need to start from where you are and work with the audience you have. Even if you do, ultimately, want to change their behaviour, you're not generally going to get there by demanding that they comply - you need to instead work with rather than against their existing reactions.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-18</dd>
</dl>


<p>Today we release Version 37.0 of the DRMacIver software system. We've been working on it for a whole year, and are pretty excited to share the results with you.</p>


<p>In reality we of course practice continuous deployment and so have been rolling out releases through the entirety of the last year, and all of our changes are breaking changes so there's no hint of semantic versioning in our release process, but nevertheless bumping the major version number is a good chance to talk about some of the exciting new developments over the last year.</p>


<p>The major improvements we've seen since the Version 36.0 release are:</p>


<ul>
<li>We've refactored an awful lot of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">legacy code</a></li>
<li>Significantly improved write performance</li>
<li>Modest improvements to read performance</li>
<li>We've fixed the bug where the brain randomly crashed in social situations</li>
<li>The system has finally <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/">evolved to the point where it can send email</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>In case you don't get the joke (you probably get the joke) it's my 37th birthday today. Today is, legally speaking, the year where I have to start saying I'm in my mid to late 30s rather than in my mid 30s.</p>


<p>Back in ancient times, when I were a wee lad in my late 20s, I used to say that I didn't really mind the idea of hitting 30 (back then 30 seemed very old) because the people I knew in their 30s were mostly like the people I knew in their 20s only they had their shit a bit more together.</p>


<p>I then spent the first half of my thirties with my shit <em>very</em> not together - life went a bit sideways in the dying months of 29 and it took me about five years before I hit rock bottom enough to start doing something about it.
The result was me rather disconnecting from people emotionally, and it didn't have a great impact on my career either.</p>


<p>People don't really notice that I'm not a software developer any more, partly because I only became famous as a software developer after I stopped being one. Officially <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/">4% of Python developers are running my code</a>. I wrote that code <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1194550244496814081">entirely after burning out</a>. I haven't actually been employed as a software developer since early 2015, outside of the occasional short term contract for Hypothesis work.</p>


<p>There's something about the software development industry that burns people out. I don't know what it is, but it does it to most people. Maybe every industry is like this and I just mostly see it in the one I know? Maybe it's just <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-16-12:06.html">acedia</a>.</p>


<p>I started to pull myself out of the hole around 2017 I guess - I moved back to London, started a PhD, kinda started seeing people. In late 2018 I started a new relationship, which has been going very well.
It prompted some reflection, and I've spent a lot of the intervening period attempting to sort my shit out in the way that a decade ago I, apparently, naively assumed would come with age.</p>


<p>Is it working? I guess.</p>


<p>Part of why I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-07-07:57.html">Easy Changes and Uncomfortable Reflections</a> was that it was what I needed to hear (that's why I write a lot of these posts). It's quite hard to escape the feeling that I could have done all this work seven years ago, or seventeen years ago, or even twenty seven years ago, and life would have gone a lot better for it. I think this is partly true, but mostly false, but it still feels like a wasted opportunity.</p>


<p>Today's Tarot draw (I've been doing daily draws even when they've not made it into the notebook) is the <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/ca.htm">Ace of Cups</a>, which signifies among other things getting in touch with your feelings. Well I've done that. It's got its good points, and there's yet more to do on that front, but also it kinda sucks in that one of the major downsides of becoming more in touch with your own feelings is that you're more aware of your feelings, and sometimes those feelings are bad. I think I've in many ways been less depressed over the last year than I've been... ever, possibly, but it doesn't necessarily <em>feel</em> like that because I'm more aware of it.</p>


<p>Especially given, as you might have noticed, there's a global pandemic on at the moment.</p>


<p>This post was meant to be reasonably optimistic - I do think that the next few years will be quite good for me - but entering my late thirties in the middle of a global pandemic feels weird. I can barely predict what next week is going to look like, let alone the next three years.</p>


<p>All told, I'm doing what I can to lay a solid foundation for whatever comes next. It might even work.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Requiem for a pair of trousers</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-17</dd>
</dl>


<p>Based on random prompting this morning think today's post is supposed to be about using stories to communicate philosophical ideas, but I don't wanna, so instead I'm going to tell you a story to communicate philosophical ideas.</p>


<p>I've spent about the last 45 minutes sitting out in the sun destroying a pair of trousers.</p>


<p>This isn't a euphemism, or a side effect, or anything else. I was literally sitting there in my garden taking a seam ripper to a pair of trousers, taking it apart for spare material.</p>


<p>The trousers were dying - there was a hole in the crotch, and the surrounding material was thin enough that if I'd patched it it'd probably have just ripped again. I didn't have any material to make a patch, and also the trousers weren't very good (and were a little tight) in the first place so I probably wouldn't have worn them even once patched. I have vague intentions of using some of the material to make home made face masks, but I'm not sure how suitable it will actually be for that, and most of it won't be used that way.</p>


<p>I didn't get very far. So far I've removed the back pockets and the zip and some of the other parts have been partially separated.</p>


<p>There is no sense in which this is a reasonable use of my time. I'm not especially good at sewing, or in this case unsewing. I could buy a cloth facemask for not that much money. If you look at the day rate I could charge a software company for my consulting services I could probably have bought two new pairs of trousers for the price.</p>


<p>These trousers came from somewhere. There's no spontaneous generation of trousers - someone sewed these together somewhere. Probably, I must admit, in a sweatshop. They're from Gap, who I doubt have the most ethical of production practices (there's a high cost in human suffering for the prevalence of cheap clothing. I'd be lying if I said I was very good at taking that into account in my purchasing habits).</p>


<p>I've probably already spent more disassembling these trousers than that unknown factory worker spent assembling them.</p>


<p>It may interest you to know that I'm alternating writing this post with continuing my trouser disassembly project. I just removed a belt loop.</p>


<p>It probably doesn't interest you to know this. That's OK. There is probably no sense in which reading this post is a reasonable use of your time either.</p>


<p>I said there was no sense in which disassembling these trousers was a reasonable use of my time, but actually that's not true. There are two important senses:</p>


<ol>
<li>I wanted to do it.</li>
<li>I feel better for having done so.</li>
</ol>


<p>It certainly wasn't <em>less</em> reasonable spending time doing this than it would have been, say, watching TV, or playing a game. I'm not going to claim it was more reasonable, but it's still something that could be considered a leisure activity for me.</p>


<p>I wrote yesterday about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-16-12:06.html">acedia</a>, the sense of being disconnected from sources of meaning, and how working with your hands is one possible antidote to that. I'm not going to claim trouser disassembly is the great cure for modern ills, but there's definitely something nice about sitting in the garden with your hands occupied, thinking as you work on semi autopilot.</p>


<p>I didn't know how to use a seam ripper before this. I was vaguely aware seam rippers were a thing, but I had to look them up in order to figure out that I already owned one in my sewing kit. So one nice side effect of this is that I now know how to use a seam ripper.</p>


<p>I was going to say that this was completely useless knowledge, but then I realised that actually I could use the seam ripper to remove the label from the inside T-shirt I was wearing, which has a really weirdly annoyingly large label.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, I forgot that the seams on labels are usually structural - they're not added on top of the seam they're attached to, but are sewn directly into it, so now I have a hole in my T-shirt that I need to sew up.</p>


<p>This is probably a metaphor for something, but I don't know what.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on Acedia</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-16</dd>
</dl>


<p>I recently read <a href="https://amzn.to/2X2QOP2">Leisure: The Basis of Culture</a> which is a strange book, which I'll be exploring a different angle on in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/">my newsletter</a> on Monday, but one thought from it that I thought was interesting and worth exploring further was the idea of <em>acedia</em>.</p>


<p>This post is just some gathering of notes from different sources related to the subject, plus some vague thoughts..</p>


<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acedia">Wikipedia entry on acedia</a> has the following to say:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Acedia (/əˈsiːdiə/; also accidie or accedie /ˈæksɪdi/, from Latin acedĭa, and this from Greek ἀκηδία, "negligence", ἀ- "lack of" -κηδία "care") has been variously defined as a state of listlessness or torpor, of not caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world. In ancient Greece akidía literally meant an inert state without pain or care. Early Christian monks used the term to define a spiritual state of listlessness and from there the term developed a markedly Christian moral tone. In modern times it has been taken up by literary figures and connected to depression.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The wikipedia article <a href="http://www.hermitary.com/solitude/acedia.html">cites what is apparently a blog for hermits</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Acedia (or accedie) has a narrow religious definition but is a far larger and wider psychological and spiritual term relevant to the history of eremiticism and solitude.</p>
<p>The narrow sense is that of sloth, indolence, laziness, as in the Western world's list of seven capital sins. Eastern Christianity is a little more comprehensive in referring to seven "temptations." Acedia is a psychological rather than moral condition, with implications for modern attitudes toward culture, conformity, and contentment. Acedia was a historical bane to monks, hermits, solitaries, and -- by extension -- to any one spiritually or intellectually inclined.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>The concept of acedia begins with the ever-observant desert fathers and mothers who first perceived and diagnosed the condition. Their first impulse was to shoo it away like a pesky insect by keeping occupied, as in the narrative of Anthony beset "by many sinful thoughts" and cured by angelic advice to stay busy  plaiting rope. Poemen avers that "acedia is there every time one begins something, and there is no worse passion, but if one recognizes it for what it is, one will gain peace." And John Cassian adds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also good to recall what Abba Moses, one of the most experienced of the fathers, told me. I had not been living long in the desert when I was troubled by listlessness [i.e., acedia]. So I went to him and said: Yesterday I was greatly troubled and weakened by listlessness, and I was not able to free myself from it until I went to see Abba Paul. Abba Moses replied to me by saying: So far from freeing yourself from it, you have surrendered to it completely and become its slave. You must realize that it will attack all the more severely because you have deserted your post, unless from now on you strive to subdue it through patience, prayer and manual labor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly acedia is not willful sloth or indolence, less so "sin," but a spiritual lethargy or indifference, a turpitude that affects the well-intentioned. Amma Theodora says:</p>
<p>You should realize that as soon as you intend to live in peace, at once evil comes and weighs down your soul through acedia, faint-heartedness, and evil thoughts. It also attacks your body through sickness, debility, weakening of the knees, and all the members. It dissipates the strength of soul and body. ... But if we are vigilant, all the temptations fall away.</p>
<p>A practical experience of acedia is described by the desert hermit Heraclides, who received a brother troubled by restlessness in his new cell. Heraclides advised him not to follow an extreme regimen of self-discipline but to eat, drink, and sleep as needed. He only asked that the brother not leave his cell. But, the narrator tells us, the brother fell "prey to acedia" and doubted the old man's advice. The brother followed his regimen but when he went to bed he found a demon lying on it, gnashing its teeth at him. The brother fled his cell to the old man's dwelling, imploring his help. Heraclides, seeing that the younger man had not followed his counsel to stay in his cell, refused to open, but the next morning, finding him still at the doorstep, Heraclides took pity on him. "Then, according to his capacity, he taught him the discipline of the solitary life, and in a short time he became a good monk."</p>
<p>John Cassian went further than his conversation with Abba Moses to describe the physical symptoms so literally, even to the hour of the day when they peak, that acedia became known as the "noonday devil." He provides an excellent description of the psychology of acedia as well, indicating that acedia is a "tedium or perturbation of heart ... akin to dejection and especially felt by wandering monks and solitaries, a persistent and obnoxious enemy to such as dwell in the desert." He goes on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When this [acedia] besieges the unhappy mind, it begets aversion from the place, boredom with one's cell, and scorn and contempt for one's brethren, whether they be dwelling with one or some way off, as careless and unspiritual-minded persons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The listlessness of acedia is akin to a feeling of inertness, John Cassian notes, producing no spiritual fruit, a sense of any practice being "empty of spiritual profit." John's remedy, following desert tradition, is a level of sustained activity approximating rigorous physical labor and what were to be called works of mercy, which fend off cynicisms. Physical labor as a solution is seen in the example of the first Christian desert hermit Paul, who regularly wove baskets of palm leaves. But being too far from a market to sell them Paul would burn his handiwork once a year and start over.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In The Book of Human Emotions, page 16, Tiffany Watt Smith describes it as:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Acedia (pronounced a-seed-ee-a) or sometimes called accidie, is an emotion that has no real equivalent today. It was a short-lived but disastrous emotional crisis, usually striking between 11AM and 4PM. Its first signs were listeness and irritability, but it didn't take long to turn into desolation and despair.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>In the sixth century =, acedia was dropped from the list of mortal sins. Some of its symptoms were absorbed into the illness melancholia, a forerunner to our own states of depression and anxiety (see: MELANCHOLY). The rest became the moral vice sloth. Though people still spoke of feeling acedia, it came to mean something more like inertia - an equivalent, perhaps, to that listless feeling which descends on a rainy Sunday morning (see: APATHY).</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In "Leisure: The Basis of Culture" acedia is introduced as follows (p27):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What did the old code of conduct mean by idleness, by <em>acedia</em>?</p>
<p>To begin with, it meant something other than we usually mean when we speak of the "root of all evils."</p>
<p>Idleness, for the older code of behavior, meant especially this: that the human being had given up on the very responsibility that comes with his dignity: that he does not want to be what God wants him to be, and that means that he does not want to be what he really, and in the ultimate sense, <em>is</em>. <em>Acedia</em> is the "despair of weakness," of which Kierkegaard said that it consists in someone "despairingly" not wanting "to be oneself". The metaphysical-theological concept of idleness means, then, that man finally does not agree with his own existence; that behind all his energetic activitity, he is not at one with himself; that, as the Middle Ages expressed it, sadness has seized him in the face of the divine Goodness that lives within him - and this sadness is that "sadness of the world" spoken of in the bible.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In Voices: The Educational Formation of Conscience, Thomas Green has a slightly different take (p. 40):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[When one behaves correctly but does not care to be correct] the internal speech of the self would be: "It doesn't really matter, but this is the way they like it. I know what they want, so I'll go along with this senseless charade even though nothing vital is at stake." Such a posture of detachment is the perspective of the uninvolved, the apathetic. It is the condition of anomie.</p>
<p>The key to this interior speech is found in that indefinite, obscure, omnipresent, and distant 'they'. How remote, ho w disguised, 'they' always are! How senseless; yet, at the same time, how pervassive are the norms of everyday life when viewed simply as the edicts that 'they' deliver, and how thoroughly, under like circumstances, do those edicts lack even the most minute measure of moral authority! This condition, as nearly as I can describe it, is closely related to a kindred state that the medievals describe as <em>acedia</em>. i.e., a kind of spiritual torpor or sickness that nowadays is often expressed as <em>ennui</em> or boredom. The ancient idea extended, however, to something more fundamental even than mere boredom. It included the notion of a certain rebelllion, a conditon of being asleep to life, a resolute rejection of any possible contentment with being what one is, namely, a human being and thus essentially a creature.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Both Green and Pieper seem to be framing acedia as a form of disconnection from sources of meaning. For Pieper this source of meaning is spiritual, for Green it is full participation as a member in a normative community.</p>


<p>It's interesting that the hermitage site suggests working with your hands as an antidote to acedia.
I'm put in mind of Matthew Crawford's <a href="https://amzn.to/3bzPSqt">Shop Class as Soulcraft</a> where he argues that professions that are very hands on are in fact much more nourishing sources of meaning than office work (I do not especially recommend this book, although there are things I like about it).</p>


<p>I'm also put in mind of James C. Scott's <a href="https://amzn.to/2X0qAN3">Two Cheers For Anarchism</a>, where he argues that we should think about work not solely in terms of its productivity, but in terms of its effect on workers:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What if we were to ask a different question of institutions and activities than the narrow neoclassical question of how efficient they are in terms of costs (e.g. resources, labor, capital) per unit of a given, specified product? What if we were to ask what kind of people a given activity or institution fostered? Any activity we can imagine, any institution, no matters what its manifest purpose, is also, willy-nilly, transforming people:</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>[the assembly line] was deliberately designed to eliminate the artisanal-craft knowledge, and the power this knowledge conferred on workers, that characterized the carriage-making era.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lx4yMm">Talking About Machines</a> Julian Orr describes such a community of artisanal-craft knowledge, in the form of photocopier technicians at Xerox PARC. These technicians clearly have both Scott's artisanal-craft knowledge and Green's normation to a community of practice. Reading Orr's descriptions of it, the technicians certainly <em>sound</em> satisfied with their jobs, but it's also very clear that management would really rather not have to deal with the complex messy realities of depending on an actual community of experts.</p>


<p>I'm additionally put in mind of Rebecca Solnit's <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ar3MOL">A Paradise Built in Hell</a> where she talks about the communities that arise in disasters, where she shows how people band together towards a common cause, and find it a powerful source of meaning - in many ways the aftermath of a disaster is a positive experience for people in these communities.</p>


<p>Pieper argues that Total Work is the source of this acedia, or perhaps that acedia is the source of total work, but it seems to me that communities of people working together towards a common cause, in ways that allow each of us to grow as a person, are in fact the <em>cure</em> for acedia, and the problem is perhaps not work per se but the way that power has reshaped work into something that treats workers as a resource to extract value from instead of people to develop alongside.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Truth and the Ghost Library</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-16</dd>
</dl>


<p>Ritual and its Consequences, p. 162:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[Fundamentalism] equates truth, which is nonindividual and supraindividual, with its interpretation, which is invariably personal and conditional.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this claim is interesting and mostly true, but also mostly false. That might be because of my interpretation of it, which is invariably personal and conditional.</p>


<p>I'm reading James C. Scott's "Domination and the Arts of Resistance" at the moment.</p>


<p>The book, as with most of Scott's work, looks at an aspect of how people behave in response to power imbalances.
In societies when one group dominates another, such as caste societies, or historical slavery in North America,
the way those groups talk among themselves is very different from the way they talk in public.</p>


<p>This leads to the idea of <em>hidden transcripts</em>.
The idea is that there is a public transcript, which is the record (usually implicit) of what goes on in public,
and the hidden transcripts, which record how the groups talk among themselves.
Both the oppressed and the oppressor have hidden transcripts that are very different from the public transcript,
which can be thought of an elaborate ritual to maintain order, in which the oppressors perform strength and the oppressed perform deference.</p>


<p>Hidden transcripts are a key part of the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-16-14:22.html">ghost knowledge</a> that pervades society - knowledge that is built and widely shared inside a community of discourse, but is never written down and is not widely known outside of that community. Unlike much ghost knowledge, which is merely <em>not</em> shared, the hidden transcripts are actively kept from those outside of the community as a protective measure.</p>


<p>You can think of knowledge about the world as being a kind of infinite ghost library, with different groups occupying (with varying degrees of jealousy) their territories within the library.</p>


<p>This is a key part my objection to the quoted passage I opened with: Interpretation is not just personal, it's very much driven by what you know, and who you talk to. People interpret in groups, and those interpretations become hidden transcripts within the ghost library.</p>


<p>Scott is careful to point out that these hidden transcripts <em>also</em> don't necessarily represent any sort of "true selves" of the oppressed, but are instead another social order, which may have its own barriers to authenticity, but I do think though that there is a gradient where the more hidden a transcript it is, the more sincere it is:</p>


<p>Scott, on page 26, lists the following under "Hypothetical Discursive Sites, Arranged by Audience, under Slavery":</p>


<ol>
<li>Harsh master/overseer</li>
<li>Indulgent master or overseer</li>
<li>Whites having no direct authority</li>
<li>Slaves and free blacks</li>
<li>Slaves of same master</li>
<li>Closest slave friends</li>
<li>Immediate family</li>
</ol>


<p>With the first three being part of the public transcripts, the last three being part of the hidden ones, and the 4th straddling the two. In the public transcripts you are very much participating in the ritual order of society, but in the private ones you can break character into sincerity and talk about what's <em>actually</em> going on.</p>


<p>From this point of view, fundamentalist social orders can be thought of as access control in the ghost library: The idea that this secret body of knowledge is in some sense <em>immoral</em>, and that that which cannot be discussed in public should not be discussed at all.</p>
