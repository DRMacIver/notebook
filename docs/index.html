<p>The following is not true, but it's often close enough to true that it's worth using as a working model.</p>


<p>When learning a skill, the level of effort required to get to a given point typically looks something like this:</p>


<p><img src="/images/effortskillgraph.png"/></p>


<p>This corresponds to the following difficulties of improvement at any given point:</p>


<p><img src="/images/difficultyskillgraph.png"/></p>


<p>(These numbers are made up imaginary units, obviously)</p>


<p>That is, the difficulty of getting better is usually pretty easy, but occasionally there are spikes where the difficulty rapidly increases. The gentle bits are the places where the way to improve is to just do the thing, the spikes are the bits where <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-do-everything">there's some insight you need to figure out to progress</a>.</p>


<p>A very simplistic model of human behaviour is that people do things that are worth the effort of doing. As a result, what often happens when people are learning a skill is that they progress as long as it's easy, and then they hit a part where it's difficult it's no longer worth it to them to keep progressing.</p>


<p>As a result what you end up with is people who stall out particular points in their skill progression, thinking they have reached the limit of their talent, when in fact all they needed was a sustained period of effort at which point they would have started getting better again.</p>


<p>I think people generally solve these problems in one of three ways:</p>


<ol>
<li>Being smart tends to lower the effort in one of these spikes. I don't know how much of this is "intrinsic" smartness and how much is having already learned the right skills of learning, but if smartness is a thing at all it certainly reduces the effort of generating insights when you're blocked on skill development.</li>
<li>Being very into the subject makes more effort seem worth it, so someone with exactly the same level of "talent" but more interest will often get better because they reach a spike in difficulty and it's still worth it to them to overcome it.</li>
<li>Having a good teacher <em>hugely</em> reduces the difficulty level of these spikes, because they already know the insights you're struggling to come up with and can help you discover them.</li>
<li>Believing in this model will often motivate you to put in more effort than seems reasonable until you've overcome the hump, banking on the promise of future reward (I think, to the degree that they do, this is a lot of why "growth mindset" interventions work).</li>
</ol>


<p>This is what I tend to mean when I say that almost nobody is bottlenecked on talent. They're probably just at a point in their skill development where it wasn't worth it for them to get better on their own, and nobody provided them with the right external support they needed to overcome the current spike in difficulty.</p>


<p>This is then compounded by the fact that the messaging they get about skill tends to convince them that this is evidence that they lack talent and will never be good at the thing, when in fact they're probably not substantially less talented than many people who end up way better than them due to a mix of luck, privilege, and motivation.</p>

<p>I'm going to describe a problem that I have. I have not yet found a good solution for it, and this is why you are getting a very nominal post today in which I describe that problem and think out loud about it.</p>


<p>The problem is this: I start with something small, and then I think "Oh this is really good, I should do it justice". </p>


<p>Doing it justice makes it... not small. Often it increases the work of doing it by a factor of ten or more. Suddenly it becomes a thing that I need to spent much longer on than I had time allocated for it, and moves it up a project size category.</p>


<p>In concrete terms what happens is that I now have two pieces that started out life as notebook posts and are going to be newsletter issues that I need to finish. They should be pretty easy to finish but I probably won't have time to do so prior to the weekend.</p>


<p>Often they languish unfinished. This was very much my problem with writing papers. It felt like in order to write an academic paper I had to publish something that was substantially worse than the state of the art that existed in my head, because in order to get to the point where it was publishable I either had to stop thinking about the problem (impossible if I were to be interested enough to finish writing it) or publish something that I felt was worse than I could have done.</p>


<p>This isn't really a problem for many things which feel like I can just snip off a thread. The notebook is good for that, but often I end up wanting to write things which have a certain minimum size without which they would end up incomplete.</p>


<p>I think part of the problem here is really not that things become large, but that I need a better way to work on large projects. The paper problem felt like a mismatch between the sort of incrementalism I wanted to do and the sort of incrementalism that academia wanted me to do. The newsletter issue problem is more manageable, and I think I just need to get better at managing my draft backlog and allocating more time to it.</p>


<p>Perhaps I can treat drafts as an inbox problem and apply the <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/triage-your-inboxes">How to triage your inboxes</a> method to it?</p>

<p class="subtitle">A lack of shared projects</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>I've been visiting my parents out in the country recently,
and as a result I was <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1414139777654431744">talking on Twitter the other day</a> about an idea I have from a book called "The Art of Frugal Hedonism" (though the idea is hardly revolutionary and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-13-11:49.html">definitely isn't something I feel like I <em>have</em> to cite</a>) that a great and commonly underrated way to spend your time is to have a mundane task to do with your hands while sitting around a table with your friends and loved ones chatting.</p>


<p>Their example was podding peas, in our case the event that prompted me thinking about it was picking and processing red currants with my family. Honestly, I think they're spot on. Having the shared task to focus on made the conversation flow very smoothly, and there was a satisfaction to doing a task that would have been slightly tedious without the company. They pair very well.</p>


<p>This got me thinking how few things in modern life look like this.</p>


<p>One thing that's interesting about it is the physicality of it, and indeed we don't do a lot of work with our hands.
Much ink has been spilled talking about this sort of thing. I too have read Shop Class as Soulcraft (and I suppose recommend it, maybe, sortof), and various takes in this space. I won't be talking about that today.</p>


<p>Instead the thing that struck me as anomalous is that we were doing something useful together,
and that's surprisingly rare. We do it at work, we do it when living together as a family. Those honestly seem like the main widespread examples to me. I can think of a few others, but they all feel in some way unusual to me.</p>


<p>I'm not saying nobody does practical projects with their friends, obviously people do, but it seems anomalous to me? Like it's a relatively rare thing, and it so easily gets coopted by work. e.g. open source projects are kinda this, but they sure mostly feel like free work rather than a practical project with friends done for our own sakes.
Sometimes you ask friends for favours and they help you achieve something, but even that feels rare and socially discouraged.</p>


<p>Doing things with friends is certainly a thing, but when we do things with friends it tends to be leisure activities.
We mostly do things because we want to spend time together, not because we're trying to achieve something.</p>


<p>I wonder if this is related to the longing some people have for community? In <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/communities-construct-a-sense-of">Communities construct a sense of purpose</a> I suggested that a lot of the function of communities is structure our emotional evaluations of what matters, and thereby construct a sense of purpose. This certainly seems related to that - trying to achieve things in tandem with people you care about feels like an almost central example of purpose.</p>


<p>I don't really have a firm conclusion here. I just find I'm staring at this in vague incomprehension going "No, this must be a thing, right? What am I missing?", and feel very strongly like something weird is going on here.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Source: The noosphere, impersonal communication</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-13</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm currently writing a newsletter issue in which I'm explaining a lot of stuff.
Very little of it is original to me, although a lot of it is my own idiosyncratic conception of it, but instead something that I have synthesized from many sources.</p>


<p>What sources?</p>


<p>Honestly, beats me.
Could be anything.</p>


<p>This reminds me of <a href="https://twitter.com/Kirsten3531/status/1412896229378379777">a recent conversation with Kirsten</a> in which she'd made a popular tweet and was trying to figure out where she got the idea from, and thought it might be me. Could have been, we're not sure. I've certainly not said exactly the same thing as she did, but I've said a number of things vaguely in that space.</p>


<p>I don't much care, honestly. The idea isn't mine. If it did come from me, I would have put it together out of ideas I'd picked up from other people. I might have combined some things, I might have tweaked it a bit, but ultimately I'm just a conduit for the flow of ideas. Words come in, at some point later words come out, and there's some relationship between the two but I can't really say that I got the latter from specifics of the former.</p>


<p>For example in the piece I'm writing at the moment (probably out some time next week) I'm talking about a bunch of ideas about how learning works. Are they original to me? No, absolutely not, I've read probably a dozen different books that have informed them.</p>


<p>But the way they informed them is mostly not traceable to a particular book. I read some books, they informed my practice, and I then wrote something based on that practice and my conception of it. The books left a significant trace, and some of them have been a significant influence on me, but I couldn't necessarily tell you what that influence was any more than I can tell you exactly when and how I learned English, I just did.</p>


<p>What to do in these cases?</p>


<p>Well I can mention some of the books I read, but even at a dozen there's no real chance of me remembering all of them (I recently bought a copy of "How children fail" only to discover I'd read it more than a decade ago. I still plan to reread it, and revisit it in a new light, but it's definitely ended up influencing me in ways I have no chance of recreating).</p>


<p>Additionally, I'll often be saying things that are at odds with those books, or frame things in a different way, or which you'd have to go through the entire multi year long process of digesting the contents of the books before you can squint at them the right way to see that they're deeply instrumental to what I'm saying.</p>


<p>And what to do about the books that are even less connected to the topics I'm writing about? My thoughts on education have definitely been influenced by reading anarchist and ethnographic writings from James C. Scott, but it would probably take an entire extra essay to unpick those links.</p>


<p>All of these problems are soluble. I could keep a detailed log of books. I could go through any books I've read that seem relevant an pick out the connections. I could carefully trace out the lineage of every thought I had in the essay and where its influences come from. None of this is unachievable.</p>


<p>It does, however, have one crucial problem: It's hard and boring and I don't wanna.</p>


<p>It's also not that useful. The reader doesn't care, and the authors I'm citing probably don't care either.</p>


<p>This may sound like excuse making, and perhaps it is, but I think it's an important consideration. If you raise the bar to writing, many pieces that were previously worth writing no longer are, and this loses out on significant value. Having to carefully attribute everything or else you're bad and you should feel bad will inhibit me, and others, from writing many things that would improve the world.</p>


<p>Norms of scrupulously crediting all your sources mostly come out of academia, where they're largely important because credit for ideas is a key part of the academic status game, and publications are supposed to be very clear about what their novel contribution is as a result.</p>


<p>Outside of academia you can just... not do that. It's mostly fine. There's no need to tie credit-assignment to citation like our lives depend on it.</p>


<p>Instead I propose the more modest set of citation norms:</p>


<ul>
<li>When you already clearly know where something comes from, obviously you should cite it and give credit.</li>
<li>Do not explicitly claim ideas as your own unless it's really overwhelmingly clear when in possession of the full facts that they are.</li>
<li>If someone attributes an idea to you that is not yours and you notice, politely correct them (for example I'm often credited for the term "life-complete problems" due to my article of the same name, but credit is due to <a href="https://twitter.com/mechanical_monk">Mechanical Monk</a>, as I explicitly highlight in the piece).</li>
<li>Recommend sources that you have found valuable, both casually and in your writing, regardless of whether they're directly the source of the idea you are writing about. For example I thought <a href="https://summerbrennan.substack.com/p/discourse-person">Discourse Person</a> was an excellent piece about related issues recently - I don't know if it informed this piece much, but it's worth a read either way!</li>
</ul>


<p>Everything is a remix, we're all riffing off each other, and worrying too much about the credit assignment game within that ruins the flow.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A library of recurring ideas</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-12</dd>
</dl>


<p>(This is a quick piece that I am writing because I realised I'm not going to finish the long piece I was writing today)</p>


<p>A thing I notice that I do more than many other people is that I just have a lot of ideas in my head that I pattern match to new situations.</p>


<p>Like e.g.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons">Market for lemons</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">Satisficing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_deviance">Positive deviance</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluralistic_ignorance">Pluralistic ignorance</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Legibility</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's law</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Kauffman">The adjacent possible</a></li>
</ul>


<p>These seem to come up time and time again. I'm only mentioning these ones because they're all things that have come up recently,
I'm sure there are dozens if not hundreds of others.</p>


<p>There are also plenty I've come up with too. e.g. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html">Skirting the edge of disaster</a> and the <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/a-fractal-of-lies">Fractal of Lies</a> have both come up recently.</p>


<p>I don't really have any good evidence that I do this more than other people, but it sure feels like it. I think I even do it more than other people who have some of the same ideas - a lot more people know about the market for lemons than go "Oh, a market for lemons" whenever they encounter the pattern in the wild. I talk about "Things that you can't unsee" but really I might just mean "Things I can't unsee".</p>


<p>Part of my evidence that I do this to an unusual degree is that I am unusually good at explaining things (at least, I think so, and other people seem to agree), and I think having this sort of library of recurring ideas is part of that: When presented with something to explain, I probably have a ready tool to hand to reach for to take it apart and reveal interesting things about it (<a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/fragments-intellectual-diy">Intellectual DIY</a> of course being another of my recurring ideas).</p>


<p>Another recurring idea that doesn't have a catchy name or something I can refer to, but which I think about a lot, is that anything someone can do is a skill that almost everyone can learn to do better (this doesn't deny talent, although I'm a low-key talent sceptic in a number of ways, I just have a lot of faith in people's ability to learn skills given the right environment).
So if this <em>is</em> something I do to an unusual degree, how can people learn to do it better?</p>


<p>Back in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/thinking-through-the-implications/">Thinking through the implications</a> I suggested a couple of things that might work:</p>


<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When learning by doing, write down interesting things you learned so you remember them later explicitly.</li>
<li>When you learn new things, try to come up with at least one application of them outside the context you’re learning them in.</li>
<li>When you encounter a new problem, see if anything you learned recently applies to it.</li>
<li>When you re-encounter a problem that you previously believed was hard or impossible, spend at least 5 minutes thinking about why it is hard or impossible and if anything you’ve learned since then changes that.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this is all good advice, but discounts the explanatory aspect of it. Perhaps the real thing to do is to just use them a lot - building up a conceptual framework in the way I discuss in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-05-10:30.html">Why do we need new terminology?</a> by writing things that they enable you to write.</p>


<p>In general, maybe writing is just the best way into this. Perhaps the reason I'm unusually good at this skill really is just writing? Or at least, writing in the way I write. In which case, perhaps the key to developing this skill is contained in:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/">How to explain anything to anyone</a></li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-02-09:29.html">People are bad at defining things</a></li>

</ul>


<p>By writing about things as we encounter them, and connecting them to our library of ideas, we train ourselves to recognise these patterns as they occur.</p>
