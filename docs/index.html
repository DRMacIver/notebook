<p class="subtitle">Indexing a DFA in shortlex order</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-06</dd>
</dl>


<p>Bad news feelings-readers, it's another technical post. Having feelings will resume shortly (probably in tomorrow's newsletter if nothing else)</p>


<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1278986162443636736">asked the other day</a> about how to find the shortlex-predecessor of a string in a regular language represented by a DFA. I eventually came up with <a href="https://gist.github.com/DRMacIver/89a7a27b70bbb795748fd20d1ad50f82">a solution that wasn't too bad</a>.
This morning in the shower I came up with a better one (disclaimer: I haven't written code for this or tested it, so it's probably subtly wrong and has off by one errors, and it may perform poorly, but the basic idea is sound in theory).</p>


<p>The basic idea is this: It's well known that using breadth first search we can enumerate the regular language in shortlex-ascending order as \(x_0, \ldots, x_n, \ldots\). Finding the predecessor of \(s\) given this enumeration is as simple as looking up \(s = x_n\) and returning \(x_{n - 1}\). Unfortunately, \(n\) may be exponentially large in \(|s|\) so doing the enumeration is horribly impractical.</p>


<p>But! It turns out, you don't have to, and this solution can be made workable (given a good bigint library to represent the indices) as follows:</p>


<p>Maintain a dynamic programming table \(C(i, k)\) which counts the number of accepted strings of length \(k\) starting from state \(i\) in the DFA. Also maintain a dynamic programming table \(R(i, k) = \sum\limits_{j = 0}^k C(i, j)\) (i.e. the number of strings of length at most \(k\) accepted from state \(i\)).</p>


<p>What this table lets you do is essentially skip over the bits of the breadth first search that you know won't lead to where you're going, and count how many strings you skipped by doing so.</p>


<p>Now, you look up \(x_n\) by first comparing values of \(R(0, k)\) to find \(k\) with \(R(0, k) &lt; n \leq R(0, k + 1)\).
We know \(k = |x_n|\). Now, walk the DFA, using \(C(i, k)\) to determine which node to transition to (using essentially the same idea - this is easier to explain in code, but I haven't written the code yet!).</p>


<p>Now, to find \(x_n = s\) we just count the number of strings in the langugage which are shortlex smaller than \(s\).
This can be established relatively easily: First count \(R(0, |s| - 1)\), all strings that are shorter than \(s\), and then work out the number of strings of length \(|s|\) that are lexicographically smaller than \(s\) by adding up sum of the strings of length \(k - i\) by walking the DFA and after reading \(i\) characters count the number of strings of length \(|s| - i - 1\) that you would get from following each \(c &lt; s_i\).</p>


<p>To be honest, I think this explanation was all clear as mud, sorry. I think either you'll get the idea immediately from the initial seed of "Use dynamic programming to get the indices" or the explanation won't clarify it, and I should have written the code instead of trying to explain this in prose. Alternatively, this is a sign that I really need to get much better at explaining this sort of thing in prose. </p>

<p class="subtitle">Getting Test-Case Reduction Unstuck with Automaton Inference</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-05</dd>
</dl>


<p>A question I get asked a lot by friends is why I don't talk about my PhD much.
The answer is generally very simple: It's because almost nobody actually wants to know about my PhD, and it's not worth the half hour of bringing them up to speed while they politely pretend that they do.</p>


<p>But, on the other hand, (a small handful of) people do generally seem interested when I talk about my technical work on Twitter, and this notebook is where I get to write about whatever the hell I want, and part of <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/why-am-i-not-working-on-my-phd">the plan to sort out my PhD</a> is to do some more non-paper research writing.</p>


<p>So today's post is about my research. Sorry for everyone who is here mainly for feelings and social commentary.</p>


<p>Context: I work on a thing called test-case reduction. Test-case reduction is basically "just" constrained optimisation of a total order (the reduction order), over some set (the test cases), where the constraint is just a black box predicate you've been handed (the interestingness test), and you've been handed a single witness of the set (the initial test case).</p>


<p>For reasons that are explained in <a href="https://drmaciver.github.io/papers/reduction-via-generation-preview.pdf">our paper about Hypothesis</a> I'm particularly interested in the case where the test cases are all byte strings (we present it as bit strings in the paper, but same deal really) where the order is the shortlex order. i.e. \(s \preceq t\) if \(|s| &lt; |t|\) or \(|s| = |t|\) and \(s \leq t\) in the lexicographic order.</p>


<p>There is an idea that I've had in the back of my head for a while:</p>


<ul>
<li>Given some interestingness test \(p\) and some starting test case \(s\), the set \(\{t: p(t) \wedge t \preceq s\}\) is finite and thus a regular language.</li>
<li>If we had a deterministic finite automaton for that language, we could just read off the shortlex-minimal string matched by that automaton using a breadth-first search, giving us the global minimum interesting test case.</li>
<li>We can infer (an approximation to) that automaton using <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0890540187900526">the L* algorithm</a> (or see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlHck7X4F20">my PyCon UK talk on the subject</a> for a less technical account).</li>
</ul>


<p>This suggests a great approach to test-case reduction: We set up the L* algorithm, make sure it gets the correct result on our initial test case, read off the minimal matching string of the automaton, check if that's correct and if not pdate the automaton, and iterate that until the automaton-minimal string is also interesting.</p>


<p>This idea is genuinely very good except for two small problems.</p>


<ol>
<li>It's prohibitively slow.</li>
<li>It doesn't work.</li>
</ol>


<p>It's prohibitively slow because the complexity of L* is weird and depends a lot on the language being learned, but in practice you're lucky if it's only \(O(n^2)\) when you use it this way. It doesn't work because although the language is regular it doesn't have a particularly nice structure a lot of the time and the algorithm isn't always able to pick up on important details as a result. For example, L* does not easily learn the constraint that two bytes can be equal but it doesn't matter what value they take beyond that.</p>


<p>This is all very unfortunate because it's a lovely idea.
Fortunately, as I discovered recently, there is actually a context in which L* can potentially be a significant boon to test-case reduction after all: You can use it offline to learn new reduction passes (a reduction pass is basically just a simple test-case reducer, but effective test-case reducers tend to be assembled out of multiple reduction passes) that are <em>not</em> prohibitively slow and correspond to established deficiencies in your existing reducer.</p>


<p>We can find deficiencies in a reducer by basically looking for ways it gets "stuck". This is based on an idea called <a href="https://agroce.github.io/issta17.pdf">test case normalization</a> which is essentially that the goal of a reducer should be that its output does not depend on the initial test case, only the interestingness test.</p>


<p>If you have some interestingess test that demonstrable does not normalize on an initial corpus of test cases (in my case these are generated by Hypothesis) you can learn a set of new reduction passes that normalizes that corpus. You do this by picking the two smallest examples, adding a reduction pass that turns the larger of the two into the smaller, and rerunning until all of the corpus is normalized (which takes at most one pass per corpus element).</p>


<p>Suppose \(s \preceq t\) are the two smallest elements of that corpus after reduction. There is a trivial reduction pass that just replaces the string \(t\) with the string \(s\) wherever it finds it. This is actually quite good, because after reduction (assuming the initial reducer is doing an OKish job of normalizing) you're much more likely to see \(t\) than chance would suggest. You can improve these odds further by removing a common prefix and suffix from each of \(s\) and \(t\).</p>


<p>But you can also generalise this further. Suppose we've extracted those common prefixes, say \(u\) and \(v\).
We now use L* to learn the predicate \(f(x) = s \preceq axb \wedge |axb| \leq |t| \wedge p(axt)\). i.e. we learn a smallish language that captures just enough information to turn the central bit of \(t\) into the central bit of \(s\).</p>


<p>We now use this language to define a new reduction pass which finds any substrings that match this DFA and replace them with the smallest element of it. By making sure L* has learned enough about \(s\) and \(t\) to correctly predict them, this ensures that the new pass can transform \(t\) into \(s\).</p>


<p>At a high level what this is doing is essentially learning patterns where your existing reducer gets "stuck" and learn just enough about the linguistic structure of the test case format to work around them.</p>


<p>Does this work?</p>


<p>Well, maybe.</p>


<p>There are roughly two ways this can go wrong:</p>


<ol>
<li>The DFA may still be impractical to learn.</li>
<li>The learned passes may not generalise well enough to be useful, so this ends up with a very large number of passes.</li>
</ol>


<p>Initial experiments on Hypothesis are pretty promising as to whether the DFAs can be learned, but the Hypothesis test-case format is very forgiving. I'll be surprised if this works well enough out of the box on human-readable test-case formats and I expect it will need more tinkering. In particular when the reduced test-cases in the corpus are far apart, I think one needs some intermediate steps to learn smaller transformations first (I have some ideas for how to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*</a> to do this. I do know algorithms that aren't just a letter and an asterisk, I promise).</p>


<p>The number of learned passes is potentially more of a problem, but conveniently I was <a href="https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/pull/2478">already working</a> on an approach to make it practical to run test-case reduction with a large number of mostly useless passes.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3ekINM9">Clear and simple as the truth</a> by Thomas and Turner, page 138:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Word for word, Gallanda's version is the worst written, the most fraudulent and the weakest, but it was the most widely read. [...] Its orientalism, which we now find tame, dazzled the sort of person who inhaled snuff and plotted tragedies in five acts. [...] We, mere anachronistic readers of the twentieth century, perceive in these volumes the cloyingly sweet taste of the eighteenth century and not the evanescent oriental aroma that two hundred years ago was their innovation and their glory. No one is to blame for this missed encounter, least of all Galland.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>I wrote before about the difficulty of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-20-15:10.html">understanding historical fact from historical records</a>. This, I think, highlights another problem for understanding history: As modern readers, it is extremely difficult for us to understand how a text would have been read at the time.</p>


<p>I've encountered this problem with reading historical mathematics. It is very hard to read historical mathematics, because one tends to read them through the lens of modern mathematics. For example, reading texts from prior to the invention of modern mathematical notation, it's very easy to think of it in terms of its modern representation.</p>


<p>The thing is, that modern representation makes certain things very obvious that were not at all obvious to historical mathematicians.</p>


<p>In general, it is very hard to read a text without looking at it through the lens of culture that we have built since that text was written. That culture gives us ways of looking, and thinking, and feeling, about the contents of the text that make it impossible for us to read it as it would have been read at the time.</p>


<p>Sometimes that culture is even informed by the text. For example, I found reading 1984 very tedious, because I found its contents obvious and predictable, but a lot of why they are obvious and predictable is that everybody has read 1984.</p>


<p>I am reminded of people who read Lord of the Rings and find it laughable because all of the characters in it are fantasy cliches.</p>

<p class="subtitle">From Maintaining to Making</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3bW2J6t">The Shock of the Old</a> by David Edgerton, page 98:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>There are many examples in the history of twentieth-century technology where enterprises started by maintaining a technology, moved on to manufacture components or the whole thing, and then to innovate. But equally there are others where maintenance did not lead to such a development.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This point is, of course, straight out of <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYUxyi">The Economy of Cities</a> by Jane Jacobs (and Edgerton explicitly mentions it).</p>


<p>I think one of the interesting dynamics of maintenance is that maintenance is intrinsically <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-01-09:38.html">context-specific</a>. You're not maintaining cars, you're maintaining this specific car. Over time, two identical objects have their own events and history - sometimes they're deliberately modified, sometimes they're just used in a particular way which causes particular strains. This intimately affects what you need to do to maintain them.</p>


<p>The skill of generalising from that maintenance is differently hard - it involves thinking about how things behave when stripped of their context, and robs you of a lot of context-specific tools. For example, it is not in the nature of the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-26-09:48.html">kludge</a> to generalise.</p>


<p>But, equally, maintenance both gives you a strong incentive to generalise, because although each object you maintain is different, you get to see many objects and start to notice the patterns through them over and over again. A maintainer is significantly more aware of what the lifecycle of the objects in use is than the manufacturer, and this probably leads very naturally into superior manufacturing if you've got the means and inclination to do so.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Cultivating the Skills of Context</p>


<dl class="metadata">

<p>Have you noticed how there are jokes that really can only exist in their extremely specific context?</p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1268905827399761921">Here's an example</a>. The joke is kinda obvious in context, but it entertained me, and there is really <em>no</em> other context in which that joke could possibly have existed.</p>


<p>Something <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1276155095370084354">I lightly advocated for recently</a> is the use of niche analogies. e.g. I get good mileage out of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">analogies between programming and therapy</a>. I also get good mileage out of analogies between farming and ethics. I also get good mileage out of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-05-09:08.html">analogies between farming and ethics</a> ("cultivating" is itself something of a farming analogy). These analogies will typically only work for a small group of people, because they have to be in the intersection of the groups who understand each of the things being compared, but they may work very well for those people.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/unusual-foundations">unusual foundations</a> I argued that you have a unique set of skills and background, and as a result may be able to take advantage of them in unique ways that allow you to achieve things more easily than advice would suggest.</p>


<p>A lot of software is <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/11/situated-software/">situated</a> - it is extremely embedded in a particular environment and use case, and has none of the things that you might expect from a more general purpose piece of software, to the point where it may be easier to write a new one than to adapt the software to a new context (this notebook blog is itself a piece of situated software).</p>


<p>What all of these have in common is that they are things that only work in a very specific context. They don't generalise (or "scale" if you prefer) outside of that context, because they take advantage of hyper-specific features that are not widely shared.</p>


<p>Is that a bad thing?</p>


<p>When I tell (or, more realistically, hear) a really funny joke that works only in that specific context, I always feel a little annoyed because I would like to share the joke and can't. But maybe the reason the joke is so funny is precisely <em>because</em> of its uniqueness - its reliance on the situation is what gives it its novelty and makes it funny.</p>


<p>Advice that generalises is great, because it can help more people, but the nature of advice is that the more you generalise it the less good it becomes, because you have to simplify it so people understand, you have to add preconditions or remove the things that depend on those preconditions. Often by the time you've reached enough people you've put in a lot of work and made it less good as a result. This is the whole reason I wrote the unusual foundations post - for any given general purpose piece of advice there is probably a better context specific piece of advice. So you end up trading off between number of people you help and how much you help them.</p>


<p>(This isn't entirely true because helping more people <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-30-17:03.html">gives you more people to innovate on the advice</a>, but you can have your cake and eat it too by sharing the advice in its context-specific form, along with explaining the context, and let other people innovate to adapt it to themselves)</p>


<p>This pattern repeats over and over again, with generalising things being a lot of work and typically making them worse.</p>


<p>But of course one nice thing about generalising is that you often don't have to do that work in the first place. Someone <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/thinking-through-the-implications/">has already invented the hammer</a>, I don't need to come up with a custom context-specific artisanal solution to hammer in this particular nail.
As a result, in the moment a general purpose solution is often easier than a context-specific one <em>as long as that general purpose solution already exists</em>.</p>


<p>This is, I think, the source of a lot of mediocrity: It's too much work to do the good thing, so we fall back to the known thing. We only use a context-specific solution when there isn't an easy general purpose one, or when the context-specific one is obvious to us (e.g. the jokes).</p>


<p>(The general-purpose solution is, of course, not <em>always</em> worse than a context-specific one - often a general-purpose solution has been refined through a great deal of time and effort, and trying to adopt a context-specific one is like rolling your own crypto: It's bad)</p>


<p>But everything we do has a rich set of context. This means that we should expect there to be a rich set of context-specific solutions available to us, and we're often likely ignoring them and trying to fit an inappropriate general purpose solution to the situation in question.</p>


<p>The solution is, I think, to generalise from the solutions we find in context, but not by generalising the solution and instead generalising the process by which we found it. By cultivating the skills of looking at a context and identifying whether it permits things that are not possible in the broader world, we lower the effort of finding context-specific solutions, which will often allow us to move from mediocrity to excellence.</p>
