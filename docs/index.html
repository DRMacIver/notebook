<p>Three cards:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj10.htm">Wheel of Fortune</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/pkn.htm">Knight of Pentacles</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/w6.htm">Six of Wands</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_construct_theory">Personal Construct Psychology</a> we organise how we look at the world through a series of bipolar <em>constructs</em>, axes around which we organise the world. For example Masculine/Feminine, Good/Evil, Strong/Weak. A construct is not necessarily a binary category (indeed usually is not) but is a line along which we can orient.</p>


<p>Kelly proposes we look for constructs by comparing three things:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>a construct is a way in which some things are alike and yet different from others. In its minimum context a construct would be a way in which two things are alike and different from a third. It should be kept in mind that the way in which the two things are like each other should be the same as the way in which they are different from the third. We do not explicitly express a whole construct if we say, ‘Mary and Alice have gentle dispositions but neither of them is as attractive as Jane.’ We would have to say something like this, if we were to express a true construct: ‘Mary and Alice are gentle; Jane is not.’ Or we might say, ‘Jane is more attractive than Mary or Alice.’</p>
</blockquote>


<p>("The Psychology of Personal Constructs", Vol 1, p 79)</p>


<p>I've been finding using pairs of cards to define axes quite interesting in my previous posts, so I thought it might by a good way to look at a set of three cards, constructing a construct between each card and the pair defined by the other two.</p>


<p>Focusing first on The Wheel of Fortune suggests the construct Impersonal/Personal to me. The Wheel of Fortune seems to be intended to be more about destinty than chance, but as a non-believer in destiny I think destiny <em>is</em> chance, it's just the pretty face we put on it to try to pretend that it is more personal than it is. Both the Knight of Pentacles and the Six of Wands in contrast represent people, each of them striving against chance in their own ways: The Knight of Pentacles doggedly plugging away at it, persevering in the face of setbacks, while the Six of Wands rides it to success, but ultimately both are people, in contrast to the faceless nature of fortune and chance.</p>


<p>This impersonality of random chance is one of the chief obstacles to using it in many contexts where it would be sensible to - there is no court of appeal against chance. If it was unfair, it was unfair. Them's the breaks.
Even if <em>statistically</em> a random procedure produces much better results than a deterministic one, people find this impersonality daunting. In many ways, this is one of the big failings of atheism as a foundation for systems of human organisation (NB I am an atheist): We can no longer pretend that random chance is the will of the gods, putting a face on the faceless.</p>


<p>To pick a random page from <a href="https://amzn.to/2KRvRRh">Random Justice</a> (p. 15):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>While the lottery has never been adopted as a general social decision-making tool, we shall see in due course that it has, in the past, bene used to resolve a fairly wide variety of matters. Yet, today, seriously to entertain the prospect of extensive social decision-making by resort to lot would probably strike most people as absurd. "To a modern educated man," Tylor remarked over a centur  ago, "drawing lots or tossing up a coin is an appeal to chance, that is, to ignorance." To argue that, in general, social goods and burdens ought to be distributed randomly is to take no account of criteria such as merit, desert, competence, and need. Why, when important decisions have to be made, should we place our trust in the luck of the draw?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This impersonality is, I think, key to this problem: We treat a person as knowledgeable, chance as ignorant. But individual <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">people's decision making should also be considered randomised</a>, so the real question is not whether decision making should be personal or impersonal, but <em>how</em> personal should we make it?</p>


<p>Now focusing on the Knight of Pentacles, we get the construct Reliable/Unreliable. The Knight of Pentacles's determining feature is his doggedness - he is dedicated to a task, he stubbornly pursues it. He's not exciting, but you can rely on him doing the work. Both success and chance are somewhat out of your control - you can influence them, but you cannot rely on them.</p>


<p>Reliability makes me think of resilience, because it requires weathering adversity regardless of what comes your way.
Picking a random page from "<a href="https://amzn.to/2VUQ4Mh">Resilience: The Science of Mastering Life's Greatest Challenges</a>" (p. 183):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Aerobic exercise can also help in reducing symptoms of depression. [...] Many other studies have found that exercise is substantially effective in easing symptoms of mild to moderate depression.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Exercise helps depression" is one of those pieces of advice that everybody knows is true and those of us who would benefit from it hates you telling them - partly because it doesn't feel internally valid, but mostly because it seems very victim blamey and doesn't suggest any way forward - if you're struggling to get out of bed you certainly don't want to go for a run, and telling you to do so will just make you feel worse about yourself.</p>


<p>Cultivating reliability when <em>not</em> depressed (or at least less depressed) may partially be a way through that. Entraining habits and rituals that just get you to do the work come hell or highwater... may still not survive a severe depression, but may last into a deeper depression than mere motivation would.</p>


<p>Finally, focusing on the Six of Wands I think we have the construct Goal/Strategy.</p>


<p>The wheel of fortune is in part about working with destiny and chance, both of which are key components to success. You need both care work (the knight) and fixing things (the wheel of fortune) to respond to and take advantage of circumstances, and to keep going until success happens. The Six of Wands is about what happens once you succeed, and is less concerned with how he got there.</p>


<p>People are very bad at maintaining this construct, often to their detriment. 
I had a conversation with a friend a while ago which went roughly along the lines:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"I'm really struggling to go to bed earlier."</p>
<p>"OK what have you tried?"</p>
<p>"I've tried going to bed earlier."</p>
<p>"No, that's a goal. What have you <em>tried</em>?"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Strategies here might be e.g. setting an early alarm and letting your sleep cycle catch up with you, taking a melatonin at 7pm and letting your body clock hit you when it's ready, creating an elaborate bedtime ritual. Just wanting the goal and forcing yourself into it against whatever habits and features of your life are currently causing you to struggle with going to bed is not a strategy.</p>


<p>From "<a href="https://amzn.to/2VVfIAD">Thinking in Bets</a>", p. 138:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>On our own, we have just one viewpoint. That's our limitation as humans. But if we take a bunch of people with that limitation and put them together in a group, we get exposed to diverse opinions, can test alternative hypotheses, and move toward accuracy. It is almost impossible for us, on our own, to get the diversity of viewpoints provided by the combined manpower of a well-formed decision pod. To get a more objective view of the world, we need an environment that exposes us to alternate hypotheses and different perspectives. That doesn't apply only to the world around us: to view <em>ourselves</em> in a more realistic way, we need other people to fill in our blind spots.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Obviously I buy into this given my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html">support group</a>, but I think there are a couple interesting points to consider here.</p>


<p>The first is that while it is definitely true that other people are incredibly helpful in this, I don't think it is true that it is almost impossible for us to get exposed to get the diversity viewpoints on our own that a good decision pod will provide (a decision pod in this case is something more or less like support group, but more focused on strategy and knowledge than personal growth and emotional health), and I think I've been demonstrating some of the techniques for that recently: You can draw on viewpoints from a <em>vastly</em> larger number of people if you're drawing from a well curated library, you can use <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-12:07.html">tarot or other randomisation</a> to drive your thinking in directions you can not otherwise see. You can figure out <a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/new-year-new-zine-plural-selves/">your plural selves</a> and deliberately enter into their roles.</p>


<p>Don't get me wrong, support group is very good, but the <em>reason</em> it is very good is not necessarily the different viewpoints that we each bring each other, but the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-27-07:57.html">personal connection we have as a group</a>. It's a specific feature of our support group that we are not there to argue with each other, and much of our perspective is shared and complementary.</p>


<p>These approaches to acquiring different perspectives yourself are, in the "<a href="https://amzn.to/2Ss1rZY">Ritual and its Consequences</a>" sense, rituals that let you enter a subjunctive world, where you look at the problem <em>as if</em> you were someone else.</p>


<p>Random page from the bits of Ritual and its Consequences I've read so far gives us page 13:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>In its ability to play with boundaries - to see the dual role of boundaries as both separating and uniting - ritual action stands in opposition to modern forms of social organization, which most often tend to absolutize boundaries, either by doing away with them totally or by apotheosizing them into unquestionable and inviolable entities. We take up this issue directly in Chapter 4. There we open the discussion of how liberal modes of social organization - and of organizing the self, we might add - maintain interaction and solidarity by doing away with boundaries rather than by teaching how to negotiate them. The only boundaries maintained in such liberal visions are those predicated on instrumental distinctions, that is on the vagaries of the division of labor.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I'm a little skeptical of the tail end of that but haven't read the chapter in question yet so will refrain from judgement.</p>


<p>I do think there is something to this idea that we tend to either do away with boundaries or treat them as inviolate, and that part of this is that people tend to get stuck at various points in construct space that they've conceptualised as integral features of themselves rather than something they can fluidly navigate. We rely on other people in part because we cannot move ourselves into the way of being that they naturally access.</p>


<p>That's fine of course. Other people are good, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html">relationships are key to our growth as people</a>, but sometimes our strategies could rely more on the impersonal than the personal, which helps avoid <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-28-06:45.html">exhausting others</a>.</p>


<p>Reliability is one where we often lean on others for it. Many people rely on others for care work (organisational, cleaning, emotional support). I'm very bad at it myself.</p>


<p>I think this is a key way in which we can move from the personal to the impersonal, by moving some of our reliability into the environment, finding ways to build physical constructs and rituals outside ourselves that help improve it.</p>


<p>The problem with this of course is that it's <em>scary</em>. We <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">alieve</a> ourselves to be unreliable, and trying to strategies our way out of that seems like it's setting us up for failure.</p>


<p>Writing this post has kinda convinced me that I need to address this, so here are some things I'm going to try:</p>


<ol>
<li>Setting up a <a href="https://howtosurvivementalillness.tumblr.com/post/162396810334/how-to-make-and-use-a-coping-board">coping board</a>.</li>
<li>Starting couch to 5k.</li>
<li>Beginning using <a href="https://todoist.com/">Todoist</a> again (I expect to fail on this one. I find TODO lists incredibly aversive)</li>
</ol>

<p class="subtitle">On not behaving like other people</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-01</dd>
</dl>


<p>From Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell (again, random dodgy PDF, waiting on paperback to arrive):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"Well, I suppose one ought not to employ a magician and then complain that he does not behave like other people," said Wellington.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This makes me think of Eric Schwizgebel's "<a href="http://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2020/04/in-praise-of-weirdness.html">In Praise of Weirdness</a>".</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What is it to be weird? I propose this: Something is weird if it's not normal. To be weird, a thing has to be somehow unusual -- but simply being unusual isn't enough. A blade of grass might be bent slightly differently than most other blades of grass. That doesn't make it weird -- not unless it's bent in some weird way. Similarly, your car's license plate number is unusual (no one else has it) but probably not weird. To be weird, a thing must be in some respect strikingly contrary to expectations.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Statistical rarity isn't enough, as I just explained. But neither is the weird necessarily something that violates our ethical, epistemic, or aesthetic norms. On the contrary, weirdness in my sense is good.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I agree with Schwitzgebel that weirdness is good. I don't entirely trust people who are not at least a little weird, and all else being equal I much prefer people who are willing to be quite weird in at least some ways.</p>


<p>(All else is usually not equal of course - many people who are weird are weird in ways that cause them to violate some social norms that are reasonably important. Weirdness is good if it does not come from being or cause you to be a jerk to other people. Fortunately many weird people are absolutely lovely)</p>


<p>Some of this is backlash. I'm sufficiently used to <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/06/on-not-quite-fitting/">being weird being associated with punishment</a> that it's very tempting to fall into the trap of "My side isn't bad! Your side is bad!" and reject normality as intrinsically terrible. As a card carrying member of "both sides are good actually" I'm not allowed to do that, but it sure is tempting.</p>


<p>I think normality is actually fine. Normality is a large set of cultural conventions which are designed to me mostly fine for most people, so most people are going to be pretty happy just settling for normality on many different axes, because life is so much easier when you do. What is bad is an excessive commitment to normality. If you are in every respects normal then you are, I'm afraid, definitionally not that interesting. That's fine. You're not required to be interesting to me. It's your choice, but equally it means that I'm probably not going to want to spend much time with you, and we're probably both better off for me acknowledging that.</p>


<p>Additionally, the <em>reasons</em> for a commitment to a normality often mean that people like this are not safe to be around for me, because they usually come with significant moral weight: They both want other people to be normal, and are less likely to be understanding in ways that they are not.</p>


<p>Circling back to the Strange and Norrell quote though, I think there's more to this than that. I think weirdness is often a good sign that someone is going to be really interesting to talk to, and I think it's for the reason that Jonathan Strange does not behave like other people: He's a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">nerd</a>, and he's a nerd about a sufficiently niche and powerful subject that it permeates is every way of being in the world, and that way of being is alien to other people because of how few others are like him (literally only one other at this point in the story!)</p>


<p>Consider that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html">all knowledge is connected</a> and that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html">learning any skill affects many other skills</a>. If you have a speciality that others lack, you will have a sideways view on the world. You will be able to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html">fix things</a> that others can't, because you have tools they do not. Properly integrated, this will tend to permeate into many other ways of looking at things, and you will gradually start to come off as a bit odd.</p>


<p>I think there is often another layer to it, which is that if you've no option but to be weird, it's often in your interests to be <em>very</em> weird.</p>


<p>In a professional context like Strange's this serves a very good function: It's a polarizing strategy for filtering out potential work environments that will not deal well with your weirdness. Strange would not enjoy working for someone who was not able to properly work with him in his role as a Magician. If someone required him to behave like a normal person he would be literally unable to do his job.
Moreover, he is in extremely high demand due, so it is his in his interests to use that leverage to ensure he does not work with such people, and by being as weird as possible early on he will filter them out sooner rather than later.</p>


<p>This is essentially a weirdness version of <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/van-halens-legendary-mms-rider">the brown M&amp;Ms test</a>: It lets you figure out early on whether someone is safe to work with or be around.</p>


<p>Another factor that tends to drive weird people to be weirder is that we might as well.</p>


<p>There's a parable that I think about a lot that I got from a Scott Alexander post that I do not otherwise recommend:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Chen Sheng was an officer serving the Qin Dynasty, famous for their draconian punishments. He was supposed to lead his army to a rendezvous point, but he got delayed by heavy rains and it became clear he was going to arrive late. The way I always hear the story told is this:</p>
<p>Chen turns to his friend Wu Guang and asks “What’s the penalty for being late?”</p>
<p>“Death,” says Wu.</p>
<p>“And what’s the penalty for rebellion?”</p>
<p>“Death,” says Wu.</p>
<p>“Well then…” says Chen Sheng.</p>
<p>And thus began the famous Dazexiang Uprising, which caused thousands of deaths and helped usher in a period of instability and chaos that resulted in the fall of the Qin Dynasty three years later.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>If you're not going to be able to pass as normal, you might as well relax on a bunch of other areas where you're not normal and struggle to conform, because at this point you're going to be punished anyway so you might as well claim what you want rather than just what you hoped you could get away with.</p>


<p>One problem I worry about with all of this that valuing weirdness for weirdness sake ends up losing a lot of the value of it as a signal. I've always been very mistrustful of people who lean hard into geek or nerd as an identity for this reason (I do tend to use it as a <em>description</em> a lot, but I do feel like there's a difference) - it seems to be valuing the trappings of interestingness without doing the work to get you there. This tends to run into David Chapman's <a href="https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths">Geeks, MOPs, and Sociopaths</a> problem where people use deliberately use difference from the norm to come off as interesting rather than just doing interesting things and letting the differences arise naturally.</p>


<p>I don't currently have a solution for this - all of the things I can think of will tend to descend into gatekeeping, which I'm generally not in favour of due to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-10-12:38.html">homophily of false positives problem</a> among other reasons.</p>


<p>Fortunately, it's not really a problem I need to solve, because generally speaking the main way I'm interested in this is how it affects my own behaviour. One of the things I've been resolving to do over the last few years is to be more comfortable with my own weirdness, and with being weird around others, because I've never been very good at passing for normal in the first place.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Ritual and Freedom</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-01</dd>
</dl>


<p>Cards:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj19.htm">The Sun</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/p9.htm">The Nine of Pentacles</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj03.htm">The Empress</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I drew the nine of pentacles first and my reaction was an instant dislike, so I drew another two cards to see if they could help me make sense of this a bit better.</p>


<p>The Nine of Pentacles and the Empress are in natural opposition to each other. The nine represents discipline and refinement, in opposition to the Empress's focus on luxury and the senses.</p>


<p>Part of why I dislike the Nine of Pentacles so much is how relatable she is. Not necessarily as an internal experience, but as a role in which I am cast. I am <em>not</em> a disciplined person, but I often come across that way as part of <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/11/reaching-into-the-whirlwind/">my attempts to claw back some structure out of a disordered internal world</a>.</p>


<p>One part where the Nine of Pentacles is internally relatable is that I'm definitely a <em>controlled</em> person, in the sense that I have a lot of my emotions far too tightly held. This is very much in opposition to the Empress, whose role is more about getting in touch with abundance and our feelings. This is something I am actively working on, as <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-12:07.html">I wrote before</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>One of the ways I have been deploying both sides of this recently - Focusing and Alexander Technique - is to try to have more fun doing exercise. Doing exercise not because I think I <em>should</em> exercise, but because my body invites me to do so and to enjoy it. Using exercise as a way to engage with my embodied self, and to drop into a flow state. So far it hasn't resulted in a massive amount of exercise, but I've done some most days, and the amount I am doing seems to be going up over time rather than down, and at no point have I done any exercise and resented it.
This is pretty amazing, and makes me think there might be something to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html">this human notion of "fun"</a> you people are always going on about.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The Sun can be taken to represent enlightenment, insight, and understanding. Finding the sense behind the chaos, attaining a new level of insight.</p>


<p>Unlearning Meditation, p 95 (The Sun):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Many impasses are made up of concepts and the mental constructs built up around them, and those are harder to become aware of than the ones that just pertain to meditation practice. The constructs may have to do with beliefs about reality, about the nature of existence, the truth of things, and so forth. They may also be personal narratives about your life or the people in it. They may also be reasons, justifications, and explanations for various behaviours and attitudes that have been running your life from behind the scenes.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Defined earlier (p 73):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>An impasse is "a predicament affording no obvious escape" according to <em>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</em>. Using that definition, one would find oneself at an impasse in meditation when there is no "obvious" way of going through something. All of the usual methods, the bright ideas and good advice, the right-sounding strategies and correc tbeliefs, don't help one go through with something that one is stuck in, one's "predicament." There is a caged feeling around such impasses. You have come face-to-face with your limitations, your ignorance, your lack of creativity, inventiveness, or insight.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Unlearning meditation" is a very "<a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-30-15:20.html">fixing things</a>" approach to meditation. You reach an impasse, and you fix it through cleverness.</p>


<p>Ritual and its Consequences, p 25-26 (The Nine of Pentacles), quoting Johnathan Z. Smith:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>There is, I believe, an essential truth to the old interpretation of "sympathetic magic" as an "offensive against the objective world" but that the wrong consequences were deduced. It is not that "magical" rituals compel the world through representation and manipulation; rather they express a realistic assessment of the fact that the world cannot be compelled"</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>I would suggest that, among other things, ritual represents the creation of a controlled environment where the variables (i.e. the accidents) of ordinary life may be displaced precisely because they are felt to be so overwhelmingly present and powerful. Ritual is a means of performing the way things out to be in conscious tension to the way things are in such a way that this ritualized perfection is recollected in the ordinary, uncontrolled course of things. Ritual relies for its power on the fact that it is concerned with quite ordinary activities, that what it describes and displays is, in principle, possible for every occurrence of these acts. But it relies, as well, for its power on the perceived fact that, in actuality, such possibilities cannot be realised.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is not the argument of the book itself, as they clarify shortly:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>a friendly amendment to Smith's argument may also be called for. Smith's attempt to save ritual practitioners from being read as prerational actors may have led him to go too far in emphasizing the cognitive aspects of incongruity - that ritual works because it allows the practitioners to think about the disjunction between ritualperformance and the real world. But it is important to note that ritual is not necessarily - or even primarily - something one thinks about. Indeed, if we take Smith's emphasis on incongruity seriously, it may actually help point us away from such a cognitive reading of ritual and toward one focusing more on the active, and endless, work on ritual.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The emphasis on "the endless work of ritual" makes me think that in contrast to Unlearning Meditation's "fixing things" attitude, ritual is care work. In this view the antidote to an impasse is not to be clever and overcome some obstacle, but to repeatedly and insistently do the work. Many meditation practices are indeed like that (it's part of why I don't get on with them).</p>


<p>The core feature of ritual, the book argues, is that it is a collective creation of "a subjunctive world" - an illusion in which we behave <em>as if</em> some thing is true. Courtesy behaviours (please and thank you) are, for example, are rituals acting in a subjunctive world of equality and free choice, in which everyone behaves as equals freely choosing to help each other. Religious rituals exist in the subjunctive world where the religious cosmology is true.</p>


<p>In Smith's vision of this, it is the fact that the subjunctive world is false that is key to the ritual, but in the vision of "Ritual and its Consequences" the factuality of the subjunctive world is, if not irrelevant, not the primary point. The purpose of the ritual is the ritual itself, and the world it allows us to operate in.</p>


<p>By learning to operate in this subjective world, we create an extension of ritual outside of its more specific forms (p 34):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>From the point of view of what we have been calling a Protestant framework, ritual behaviour often appears as a submission of humans to external norms - as a rejection of autonomy. Ritual, from such a point of view, consists of discipline and constraint, whereas sincerity is a turn inward toward the true self. From the point of view of a ritual order, whowever, this is not the case at all: a ritual order does not assume that all action is or even necessarily should be a repetition of rituals from the past. By definition, most action is not. The point is that, ideally, such actions should, in a sense, be ritual without ritual precedent.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Holy Foucault, Batman.</p>


<p>I am put in mind of the following passage from Nora Bateson's "Small Arcs of Larger Circles" (p73-74). Her son has been having nightmares about zombies, and has been acting up in school. These are related.</p>


<p>What's a zombie? Well, in his words:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"zombies are people who cannot think for themselves, they want you to be like them. ...And, if you do what they say, your dignity flies out the window."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So Bateson makes the following suggestion:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Trevor is an actor, and he was already studying performance at the time. So I offered him his first paid acting job. I promised him 100 dollars to play the part of the Straight-A student until the end of the school year, (it was already February). If he could play that part the zombies would be fooled into thinking that they could stop trying to control him. Hopefully he would have some peace. But, I had one caveat: that he never, ever, ever believe that he actually was that Straight-A student the world wanted him to be. I said "Play the part, but I want my Trevor for a son, not a zombie."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Bateson seems very proud of her cunning plan, to such a degree that she appears to have missed that she has conned her son into becoming a zombie.</p>


<p>The problem is that <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">you cannot norm to a group without a certain amount of internalising its ideals</a>. If you put on the mask, the mask will eventually become your face, because you will have learned the skill set of performing in that group, and your skills performing outside of that role will atrophy. More, you will internalise the idea that stepping out of that role will get you punished, leaving you with a comfort zone that is sharply defined by the role you have learned to play.</p>


<p>Focusing-Oriented Psychotherapy, p 285 (The Empress):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>In therapy the interaction should not too often duplicate the common childhood type in which someone defines reality for the client, and the client is supposed to listen. Everyone has had that kind of interaction with parents, teachers, experts, overweening friends, perhaps also with unskilled therapists.</p>
<p>In such an interaction <em>the other person</em> is active, animated, perceiving clearly, explaining clearly, taking up space, defining the world, moving ahead - just the interactional modes that the client needs to discover. Meanwhile the client is passive, is impinged upon, is expected to listen and put away thoughts and feelings that are already there, pushing them back, crowding everything in further so as to make room for what is being expressed, then to wait till the other comes to the point, follow the other's reasoning, and see the other's good sense.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This defining of reality for you is in many ways the <em>point</em> of pervasive ritual. We are very much creatures who share our cognition, outsourcing as much of our thinking and behaviour to the people and world around us as we can get away with.</p>


<p>A lot of what I'm trying to navigate is figuring out <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html">the synthesis between different sides of our self</a>. Generally speaking, whenever you orient human experience between two extremes, you find that both of the extremes are a bit pathological, and healthy behaviour looks like not being stuck.</p>


<p>But there's a problem with this when it comes to discipline vs free expression of emotions:
Once you have the possibility of discipline, you have <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-15-06:31.html">the obligation to be disciplined</a>, in a way that makes it almost impossible to freely switch between the two.</p>


<p>By its nature, discipline once acquired is a hard skill to turn off. Its mere presence is an inhibiting factor - consider a man pointing a gun at you. The man does not have to ever fire the gun to use it to control your behaviour, because the threat of being shot is sufficient. Once you have internalised the skills and norms of discipline, you are ever under its control, because your free expression is limited by the fact that if it ever gets too much (and what counts as "too much" is very much defined by external norms that you have internalised), you will act and bring it into line.</p>


<p>"Ritual and its Consequences" defines ritual as in opposition to <em>sincerity</em>. From page 14:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Sincerity imagines a world "as is" instead of ritual's multiple worlds of "as if." It looks to discursive meanings and unique selves instead of repeated acts and fragmented realities.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Frankly, speaking as someone vaguely on the autistic spectrum, the idea that the majority of human culture views the world <em>as it is</em> seems very implausible to me. It's possible the authors will get more into this later (I'm only part of the way through the book), but I think the authors are perhaps confusing a widely shared intersubjective world with objective reality. The issue is less that we are focused on a single world as it is and more that we have adopted a single ritual world to the exclusion of all others. We've demanded excessive coherency, not with reality, but with each other.</p>


<p>However, the antidote is perhaps the same, in that we can counterbalance the norming effect of rituals with more rituals that we can switch between.
If ritual got us into this mess, perhaps ritual can also get us out of it.</p>


<p>From "Invitation to Personal Construct Psychology", p 114, the chapter "Can You Really Hypnotise People?":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>So make-believe, the world of "as if", affords us, in everyday life, opportunities to go beyond the confines of our immediate circumstances, to explore corners of our souls we hide from the world, to elaborate and give full weight to aspects of ourselves we often cannont safely explore in our day-to-day lives. This lack of 'safety' exists perhaps in the form of social constraints on some kinds of behaviour, or it may take the form of the threat and insecurity we feel when we consider the possibility of being a different kind of person. Perhaps we see ourselves as 'submissive' and would like to be more 'assertive'. But the costs are dear, in real life, of gaily throwing off our familiar ways of being and stepping into ... who knows what? Who has not, in imagination, 'practised' some confrontational encounter, playing out in their mind's eye the possibilities of different scenarios. So the first point we are making is that the world of 'as if' is an important part of our normal lives, and affords us opportunities for safe exploration which are of benefit to us in tackling life's problems, from returning faulty merchandise to becoming a more confident person.</p>
<p>To return to the issue of hypnosis, the link here is that research from a variety of sources has demonstrated that 'good' subjects, people who seem able to make best use of hypnotic suggestions and easily experience the suggested effects, are doing so by the use of the same kinds of imaginative strategies. The good subject enters into the make-believe spirit of hypnotic suggestion uncritically, and under this 'safe umbrellla' freely allows themselves to explore the possibilities for thought, feeling and experience that the hypontist (like the author) suggests. So we are now at a point of seeing hypnosis not as something abnormal and unusual, but as the harnessing of a mode of thought or psychological functioning which is part of our normal, everyday lives.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In this scenario, hypnosis serves as a ritual playing a very different role from becoming a zombie, in that instead of creating an all encompassing subjunctive world in which you must behave <em>as if</em> the rules of society were absolute, it creates a much smaller world in which you are temporarily given <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html">permission</a> to take off those strictures imposed upon you by society and explore an aspect of yourself that you would normally keep hiding.</p>


<p>We in fact have many of these ritual forms in daily life. For example, social drinking of alcohol is such a ritual. Much of drunkenness is socially constructed ritual: Alcohol certainly has a physiological and psychological effect on us, but little of the actual behaviour of drunkenness is that effect. Instead it is a shared illusion, entering into a world where we behave <em>as if</em> we can be more free with our feelings.</p>


<p>Therapy is another example. In many cases the therapist is no more useful than a rubber duck (in many cases they are much more useful of course), but a significant part of the use of therapy is that it lets you enter into a space where you can talk about and attempt to solve your problems.</p>


<p>If the threat of our own discipline is what prevents us from embracing the freedom of our own emotions, then these sorts of ritual spaces can create the possibility of disarmament. The way to be free is not to reject discipline and ritual, but instead to use them to construct ways of being that give us the freedoms that we want.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Care Work and Fixing Things</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-30</dd>
</dl>


<p>I ended up drawing a larger hand for inspiration today. In order of drawing:</p>


<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/pqn.htm">Queen of Pentacles</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/ppg.htm">Page of Pentacles</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/s3.htm">Three of Swords</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/w9.htm">Nine of Wands</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/wa.htm">Ace of Wands</a></li>
</ol>


<p>To me, these seem to naturally organise themselves around the three of swords, which is a fairly negative card: Heartbreak, loneliness, betrayal, which I naturally want to connect up to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. People are certainly feeling lonely right now what with the disconnection of not seeing our loved ones. "Feeling isolated from those you love" is literally one of the meanings of the card.</p>


<p>Betrayal also feels apt. I've not been betrayed by anyone I love, but there is definitely a sense of being betrayed by the world and our institutions. Heartbreak? Maybe not literally, but the world definitely seems a swarm of negative emotions right now. This is definitely a COVID-19 card.</p>


<p>A friend who is rather more expert at tarot than I am pointed out a natural pairing: Queen of Pentacles with Nine of Wands, Page of Pentacles with Ace of Wands.</p>


<p>To me these pairings make me think of two sorts of practical orientations towards the world.</p>


<p>The first is what you might call <em>care work</em>. </p>


<p>The Queen of Pentacles is nurturing, resourceful, trustwothy. She takes care of others. She's practical, matter of fact, and trustworthy. She's very much a maternal figure, one you can imagine running a large family.</p>


<p>The Queen of Pentacles does this out of a spirit of warmth and big-heartedness, a desire to nurture others, but I think the Nine of Wands reveals something of the truth of what such care actually looks like: Exhausting. The nine of wands represents defensiveness, perseverance, stamina. He's tired and wounded, but he persists. Defensive, cynical perhaps, but not angry. He may protect others as well as himself, but he's cautious.</p>


<p>This combination makes me think of Pratchett's Witches.</p>


<p>From "<a href="https://amzn.to/2yV7Ztl">I Shall Wear Midnight</a>":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>‘I wish it wasn’t you doing this, Tiff. You’re not sixteen yet and I see you running around nursing people and bandaging people and who knows what chores. You shouldn’t have to be doing all of that.’</p>
<p>‘Yes, I know,’ said Tiffany.</p>
<p>‘Why? ’ he asked again.</p>
<p>‘Because other people don’t, or won’t, or can’t, that’s why.’</p>
<p>‘But it’s not your business, is it?’</p>
<p>‘I make it my business. I’m a witch. It’s what we do. When it’s nobody else’s business, it’s my business,’ Tiffany said quickly.</p>
<p>‘Yes, but we all thought it was going to be about whizzing around on brooms and suchlike, not cutting old ladies’ toenails for them.’</p>
<p>‘But people don’t understand what’s needed,’ said Tiffany. ‘It’s not that they are bad; it’s just that they don’t think. Take old Mrs Stocking, who’s got nothing in the world except her cat and a whole lot of arthritis. People were getting her a bite to eat often enough, that is true, but no one was noticing that her toenails were so long they were tangling up inside her boots and so she’d not been able to take them off for a year! People around here are OK when it comes to food and the occasional bunch of flowers, but they are not around when things get a little on the messy side. Witches notice these things. Oh, there’s a certain amount of whizzing about, that’s true enough, but mostly it’s only to get quickly to somewhere there is a mess.’</p>
<p>Her father shook his head. ‘And you like doing this?’</p>
<p>‘Yes.’</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>Tiffany had to think about this, her father’s eyes never leaving her face. ‘Well, Dad, you know how Granny Aching always used to say, “Feed them as is hungry, clothe them as is naked, and speak up for them as has no voices”? Well, I reckon there is room in there for “Grasp for them as can’t bend, reach for them as can’t stretch, wipe for them as can’t twist”, don’t you? And because sometimes you get a good day that makes up for all the bad days and, just for a moment, you hear the world turning,’ said Tiffany. ‘I can’t put it any other way.’</p>
<p>Her father looked at her with a kind of proud puzzlement. ‘And you think that’s worth it, do you?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, Dad!’</p>
<p>‘Then I am proud of you, jiggit, you are doing a man’s job!’</p>
<p>He’d used the pet name only the family knew, and so she kissed him politely and did not tell him that he was unlikely to see a man doing the job that she did.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I was listening to Journal Entries yesterday, in particular <a href="https://journalentries.fireside.fm/ashton-and-mckenna">the entry about the paper situating feminist epistemology</a>.</p>


<p>From <a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/ASHSFE.pdf">the paper itself</a>: </p>


<blockquote>
<p>As well as affecting the evidence that they have access to, Hartsock argues that women’s experiences can also affect the way they weight the importance of different questions and activities. One example Hartsock provides, from Marilyn French’s novel The Women’s Room, makes this point especially vividly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Washing the toilet used by three males, and the floor and walls around it, is, Mira thought, coming face to face with necessity. And that is why women were saner than men, did not come up with the mad, absurd schemes men developed; they were in touch with necessity, they had to wash the toilet bowl and floor (French 1978: 214).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea being captured here is that the roles women play in society affect the weight they give to different concerns and questions. There are some questions and topics that they don’t have the luxury of spending time and effort on (and others that they are vividly aware of the material importance of) because they have to clean up piss on a regular basis.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I'll hold off on weighing in too strongly on the gender politics of this, but I think it is more than fair to say that carer roles are female coded, and care skews significantly female in numbers.</p>


<p>The dual to care work is what you might think of as <em>fixing things</em>.</p>


<p>The ace of wands is "Creative Force", "Enthusiasm", "Confidence", "Courage". Some actions suggested are "Inventing a better way", "being ready to tackle the world", "tackling a challenging task".</p>


<p>This pairs well with the page of pentacles: "Have an effect", "Be practical". "Mold the physical world".</p>


<p>"Fixing things" is absolutely the essence of what French terms "the mad, absurd schemes men developed". It's a category with a very masculine coded energy to it. It's what you do when there is a big problem and something must be done to solve it.</p>


<p>(Side note: I really doubt there's much if anything that makes one gender or another intrinsically better suited to these roles. It's mostly just <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/gendering/">gendering</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">culture</a>. I do think the gendered aspect of these roles is important to pay attention to to understand how this plays out).</p>


<p>Care work and fixing things both exist to solve problems in the world that affect people. Fixing things is for big one off failures - they might fail again, sure, but they don't fail on any predictable schedule, or in exactly the same way. Each problem is big, and novel, and you need to figure it out and do something clever (but hopefully not <em>too</em> clever) to solve it.</p>


<p>Care work, on the other hand, consists of fixing the endless grind of little problems which affect the world on a day to day basis. Problems that are important but unglamorous, and that will keep coming back over and over.</p>


<p>Care work is work that is centered on tasks you know you're going to have to do, while fixing things is centered on less predictable tasks that you only know are needed when something breaks.</p>


<p>Care work is by no means unskilled, but one of its distinguishing features from fixing things is that once you have acquired the relevant skills you just have to do the work. There's no clever shortcuts, you just need to keep things up day in and day out. You'll gradually get more efficient as you learn what corners to cut, how to do individual tasks better, etc. but the savings are at best constant factors - they might make it significantly faster, but they don't fundamentally change the nature of the task.</p>


<p>In contrast, fixing things is very cleverness driven. You find the right <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-26-09:48.html">kludge</a> or clever way of looking at the problem, and suddenly the whole thing cracks wide open.</p>


<p>A distinguishing feature of this is that care work looks less impressive than it is, and fixing things looks more impressive. Care work you look at and go "Pft, I could have done that" (you probably could, but you don't want to and also it would have taken you much longer and you'd have blown the time budget as a result), while fixing things you look at and go "Wow, I could never have done that" (you probably could, they just invested a lot of time and effort to develop a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-12-11:35.html">good intution</a> on the subject).</p>


<p>I do sometimes suspect that there is a discounting in the other direction too: We treat care work as exhausting, and fixing things as fun and creative, but I do notice (among other things) how much burnout there is in software developers and suspect a great deal of this is that the relative ease of any given fix compared to the endless toil of care work causes us to discount the hidden costs of context switching and constantly fighting new and unique fires each time.</p>


<p>In general I think there's a risk that whichever one you think is most important, you tend to discount the other, because each of these things is hard in very different ways. Carers think of fixers as lazy, and fixers think of carers as stupid. They're both wrong of course.</p>


<p>There is definitely a credit gap, where we over valorise fixing and under valorise care. There is, I think, no doubt that this is the case, and little doubt that the way we gender the relevant tasks and skills is a major part of that. One of the major things we are seeing in the COVID-19 crisis is how many things that are care work in this sense are critical in a way that was not previously appreciated.</p>


<p>We are also, however, also seeing the need for fixing things. The systems we live in our breaking in all sorts of new and exciting ways. We're seeing people adapting creatively, finding <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-07-10:05.html">new ways to use things</a>, adapting and figuring out new things on the fly as we find new problems and new ways things are broken.</p>


<p>We're also seeing this at the larger level: The basic response to the disease demonstrably needs both parts. We need both to take care of people as and when they get ill, and we also need new solutions to try to ultimately solve the problem. Focusing on either to the exclusion of the other would be a mistake, and it would be a mistake that potentially kills hundreds of thousands of people.</p>


<p>Part of this is, I think, going to involve acknowledging that this dichotomy between the two skill sets is rather blurrier than we often pretend it is - there's no sharp line at which you go from care work to fixing things, and each includes some of the other.</p>


<p>Another part is going to be to learn to value the skill set of the other side, and acknowledge that each has different tasks and difficulties, and without both being well handled the whole system falls apart.</p>


<p>A way I've seen this personally is figuring out what a valuable help customer service people can be to software development. Customer service is very much care work - most of it is just talking to people, hand holding, answering the same basic questions over and over again. It is, as French puts it, "coming face to face with necessity", and as a result they understand how actual users use the system, and this is an expertise that as your coworker you can draw upon through the simple expedient of treating them with respect and asking them questions.</p>


<p>They, too, can draw on you and your expertise, because as a developer you have the ability to change the system, so they can just come to you with problems and you can fix those problems.</p>


<p>The ideal, of course, would be that everybody would be amazing at both care work and fixing things, but I think the reality is that this is impossible. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-15-12:24.html">Berkson's paradox</a> is probably causing me to overestimate its difficult, but ultimately both are hard skillsets that take a long time to acquire, and don't overlap <em>that</em> much (although in order to peak at either <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html">you probably have to learn some of the other</a>), so it's worth a certain amount of specialisation despite the overlapping skill sets, and given that we should learn to treat each side with respect, and to learn the <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2015/02/what-are-developer-adjacent-skills/">skills adjacent to</a> the other way of working.</p>

<p>Today's Card: The Magician:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The Magician is the archetype of the active, masculine principle - the ultimate achiever. He symbolizes the power to tap universal forces and use them for creative purposes. Note his stance in the picture. He acts as a lightening rod - one arm extended up into the Divine for inspiration, the other pointing toward Earth to ground this potent energy. [note] His abilities appear magical at times because his will helps him achieve what seem to be miracles.</p>
<p>What makes the Magician so powerful? First, he is not afraid to act. He believes in himself and is willing to put that belief on the line. He also knows what he intends to do and why. He doesn't hesitate because he understands his situation exactly. The Magician can focus with single-minded determination. As long as he remembers the divine source of his power, the Magician remains the perfect conduit for miracles.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Susanna Clarke's "<a href="https://amzn.to/3cYqmwd">Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel</a>" is my natural association for magicians.
A random selection from it gives:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The old King is dead. The new King approaches! And at his approach the world sheds its sorrow. The sins of the old King dissolve like morning mist! The world assumes the character of the new. His virtues fill up the wood and the wold!"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(I've misplaced my physical copy, so this comes from a slightly dodgy PDF so no page number for now until a new copy arrives)</p>


<p>In this scene, Stephen Black has killed The Man With The Thistledown Hair (yes this is really how he is referred to throughout the entire book). As a consequence of this, Stephen Black is now the new king of The Man With The Thistledown Hair's Faerie kingdom of Lost Hope. He intends to be a very different king:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"This house," he told them at last, "is disordered and dirty. Its inhabitants have idled away
their days in pointless pleasures and in celebrations of past cruelties - things that ought not
to be remembered, let alone celebrated. I have often observed it and often regretted it. All
these faults, I shall in time set right."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This isn't the main point I want to cover in this post, but a thing I can't help but noticing is that the interactions between Stephen Black and The Man With The Thistledown Hair are an interesting study in colonialism. Each is a member of a colonised people who has been shaped into a particular vision of what Englishness looks like, and each has deployed that Englishness against others.</p>


<p>In the case of The Man With The Thistledown Hair, he has spent the entire book tormenting Stephen Black by "helping" him in ways that are of no help whatsoever and mostly cause him distress, all the while ignoring what he wants and needs.
Principle among those is that he wants and needs The Man With The Thistledown Hair to <em>leave him alone</em>.</p>


<p>Stephen Black, meanwhile, when given power over Faeries responses as the British (really, the English) have always done: By denigrating the local population as disordered, unclean, and slovenly, and in need of having some proper British values imposed upon them.</p>


<p>(In the context of the story he is of course <em>right</em> that the Faerie are these things, but we are usually right in the version of the stories we tell, and Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is very English in its viewpoint).</p>


<p>The idea of the new king as the opportunity for the rebirth of society is an interesting one, and is in many ways how we view leaders more broadly. It typically fails in practice, because a leader is less important than the inertia of the system they lead, but we nevertheless persist in the idea that it is possible, and I think a lot of this is because of the role leaders serve for us as vessels into which we can pour our hopes.</p>


<p>I've recently finished reading James C. Scott's "<a href="https://amzn.to/2YfwKer">The Art of Not Being Governed</a>". Chapter 8, "Prophets of Renewal", is about how many of the recurring rebellions by the hill people of South East Asia against the valley dwelling padi states are lead by people styling themselves as prophets and miracle workers (magicians!).</p>


<p>These miracle-workers are often themselves the subject of prophecy, the subject of utopian visions in which the oppressive state is replaced with a utopian one:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>That a Karen King would yet appear.
The Talain [Mon] Kings have had their season
The Burmese Kings have had their season
ANd the foreign Kings will have their season
But the Karen King will yet appear
When the Karen King arriaves
There will only be one monarch
When the Karen King arrives
There will be neither rich nor poor
When the Karen King arrives
Every thing [creature] will be happy
Lions and leopards will lose their savageness</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(Please note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people">the Karen in question</a> have no desire to speak to your manager)</p>


<p>These prophecies are part of a general cultural impetus to rebellion and, as Scott puts it, "prophets are a dime a dozen". It is less that prophets create rebellions and more that prophets are created by the people they lead:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Charisma is, above all, a specific cultural relationship between a would-be prophetic figure and his or her potential following. And because it is a relationship or an interpresonal resonance, we cannot claim that an individual has charisma in the same way we might say that someone has a gold coin in his pocket.</p>
<p>[...] a charismatic connection might be conceived as a specific congregation looking for a preacher whose message it can wholeheartedly embrace and whom it believes it can trust. It is as if the destination is largely known and specified (however ambitious it may be), and the congregation is in search of reliable transportation. The prophet is, in this sense, a vehicle.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It is the society within which a successful prophet appears that, in effect, lays down the basic script that shapes the prophet's repertoise.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Let us imagine a bard who lives exclusively by the voluntary contributions of ordinary people in the marketplace. And let us assume, for the sake of argument, that each of those who like what he sings gives him an identical small "copper." Having conjured up a bard who wants to please a large audience, let us further imagine that this bard has a repertoire of, say, a thousand songs and stories from which to select. Assuming that his audience has definite tastes, I imagine that, little by little, as the bard comes to know his audience, the actual songs he sings in the market square - perhaps even the order and style in which he sings them - will come to more closely approximate the distribution of tastes among his audience.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Rather than the prophets leading the the people into rebellion, prophets are a technology that the people use to achieve their goal of rebellion.
A <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-13-11:35.html">domus</a> forms between the general memetic background of the people, their behaviour, and the behaviour of the prophet, with each shaping the others to be better suited to their needs.</p>


<p>Scott is quick to point out that we do need to consider the individual prophets in this:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[This analogy] allows too little for the creativity of the prophet and his capacity to add to the repertoire and to change tastes.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The prophet is absolutely a shaper of the rebellion, but what they are shaping is a kind of... filtering and simplification of the memetic background. A large body of knowledge and beliefs is being filtered through the prophet, and the prophet's job is to essentially distill it into a coherent and punchy narrative. The prophet is the elevator pitch for a larger body of cultural knowledge, and which of many potential prophets succeed is a function of how well they embody this role.</p>


<p>Though we can think of the prophet as the magician, like the two magicians of the book they are also the spell:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"They have their faults, as other men do, but their achievements are still
remarkable. Make no mistake; I am John Uskglass's man. Or would be, if he were here. But
you must admit that the restoration of English magic is their work, not his."</p>
<p>"Their work!" scoffed Vinculus. "Theirs? Do you still not understand? They are the spell John
Uskglass is doing. That is all they have ever been. And he is doing it now!"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Strange and Norrell may be the spell cast by John Uskglass, but in many ways John Uskglass it not a person, but a personification. John Uskglass <em>is</em> English magic, in more sense than one: He is the codifier of it, but also English magic is grounded in his alliances with England. If Strange and Norrell are the spell cast by John Uskglass, John Uskglass is as much the spell cast by England.</p>


<p>Stephen Black, too, is ultimately the product of this sort of spellcraft. His rise to power comes off the back of a literal spell cast by Strange and Norrell that causes him to, temporarily, embody the power of English magic. Although he is no magician-king, his ability to channel the power of English magic is what grants him the ability to defeat The Man With The Thistledown Hair.</p>


<p>(I cannot help but point out how interesting it is that English magic employed by English aristocrats is both what decides a conflict between two colonised people, and what brought them into conflict in the first place)</p>


<p>Prior to the casting of that spell, Stephen Black is a character distinctly lacking in agency. This isn't his fault, he's merely trapped by someone with significantly more power than him. Prior to that point, all he can do is appease and try to limit the damage that The Man With The Thistledown Hair can do.</p>


<p>However, once he is granted power, with it comes agency: He has the ability to act on that power, and he does.
He embodies the card of the Magician, and through his willingness to act becomes a conduit for miracles.</p>


<p>This, I think, is the other aspect of the role of prophet in a rebellion that it is important to acknowledge:
The prophet may be but the conduit for the power that cast them in this role,
but that power grants them a greater agency than they would otherwise possess, and it is that agency that allows them to make those choices.</p>


<p>In many ways, this increased agency is the purpose of the leader. The <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-24-09:38.html">basic unit of democracy is the discussion</a>, and discussion is slow and ponderous.
The reason why we create and empower these leaders is not just to give <em>them</em> agency, but to experience that agency ourselves through them.</p>


<p>This approach of course has many failure modes, and we're seeing many of those modes in the rise of populism, but it is an understandable desire, and a powerful social technology if we can use it safely. If we get good enough at that technology, perhaps it really will become indistinguishable from magic.</p>
