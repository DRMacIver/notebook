<p>You know what makes me mad?</p>


<p>Well, everything makes me mad. It's kinda my brand.</p>


<p>But <em>specifically</em> a thing that has raised me to incandescent levels of rage recently is this:
The idea that hard work is sufficient for success.</p>


<p>This idea is toxic and if you spread it you are hurting people. Cut it the fuck out.</p>


<p>This post is triggered somewhat by answers to <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1067357012730814464">a question I had about how to learn to write poetry</a>,
but it's not really the people giving those answers I'm mad at. This is mostly leftover <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1062418357788532736">rage from an awful book about writing</a>.</p>


<p>Hard work is <em>necessary</em> for success. You will never get good at something without a lot of practice at it. "Natural talent" is an illusion mostly caused by natural interest - the people who are naturally good at something are the people who are constantly thinking about it and doing it.
Even when some people are naturally better at some things than others, that does not change the necessity of hard work, only the effectiveness of the work you do.</p>


<p>But when you treat hard work as sufficient for success you are basically throwing people who have not figured out the right approach themselves under a bus.
They may be working incredibly hard and you are telling them that the reason they are failing is because they're not working hard enough.
This advice will burn people out and possibly literally kill them.</p>


<p>The correct way to get better at anything is the following:</p>


<ol>
<li>Figure out what aspect you need to improve.</li>
<li>Figure out how to improve that aspect.</li>
<li>Work hard on improving that aspect.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, the thing I really need to work on if I want my writing to improve is probably to work on my editing skills.
My writing quality has mostly plateaued, and I haven't prioritised fixing that, so I mostly <em>haven't</em> been working on improving it,
but that's what I would do if I wanted to.</p>


<p>If you do not do the first two steps then step three will work only by luck.
Many people are lucky and figure out the first two steps on their own, possibly without even noticing that they have done so,
but many do not and are then made sad by your terrible awful dangerous advice that step three is sufficient on its own.</p>


<p>Please note: I will not accept your exceptionalist bullshit about why your subject is special and comes from the soul and these rules do not apply.
Your subject is not fucking special.
It is a skill.</p>


<p>Nobody can do your hard work for you, but steps 1 and 2 are <em>absolutely</em> something that experts can help you overcome,
by giving you an idea of the shape of the answer and providing you with help on debugging your current weaknesses.
There is no royal road to philosophy or any other skill,
but it sure helps if someone hands you a machete and points you in the right direction rather than just dropping you in the middle of the forest and saying "I'm sure it's somewhere around here. Good luck, have fun!".</p>


<p>As a teacher your moral obligation is not to save people from having to work hard, it is to ensure that when they work hard they do so in a way that helps them improve.</p>


<p>This is something our education system reliably fails to do. Depending on the subject in question we vary from dismal to appalling, but it is very rare for the education system to reach the heady heights of mediocrity in this regard.</p>


<p>I do not know how to fix our education system. It's a mess. Instead I am doing damage control, trying to counterbalance its worst excesses.
We live in a world where most people have been damaged by it, and I would greatly appreciate it if you would stop rubbing salt into their wounds by repeating the worst of its lies.</p>

<p>I have a habit for stopping myself from buying too many books in book stores:
When I see a book that I want but am unsure about, I go "Oh that looks interesting" and take a photo of the book instead of buying it.
I try to make sure when doing this I always buy at least one or two books so I don't feel like I'm ripping the store off,
but it curbs the worst of the spending spree impulse.</p>


<p>Anyway I was in Cambridge University Press book store yesterday. The following are the books I noted as looking interesting but probably available via my university library:</p>


<ul>
<li>Geometry and topological inference - Boissonnat et al.</li>
<li>High-Dimensional Probability - Vershynin</li>
<li>A student's guide to Lagrangians and Hamiltonians - Hamill</li>
<li>Reporting Results - A Practical Guide for Engineers and Scientists - Van Aken and Hosford</li>
<li>Statistical Inference as Severe Testing - Mayo</li>
<li>Creative Mathematics - Beardon</li>
<li>Subjective Probability - Jeffrey</li>
<li>Butcher's Copy-Editing - Butcher et al.</li>
<li>The Reader's Brain - Douglas</li>
<li>Handbook for Academic Authors - Luey</li>
<li>Writing Sucessful Academic Books - Haynes</li>
</ul>


<p>The books I actually bought were:</p>


<ul>
<li>Learn to write badly - Billig</li>
<li>Resilience - Southwick and Charney</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm currently about halfway through "Learn to write badly". It's both very interesting and not at all what it sounds like.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Building Friendships</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-26</dd>
</dl>


<p>A reframing that I've been finding helpful recently is to stop thinking in terms of "making friends" and move to thinking in terms of "building friendships".
I don't think you should feel any particular obligation to do the same, but it's been helpful to me.</p>


<p>Why?</p>


<ol>
<li>Someone is not binary either your friend or not your friend. You don't just "make friends" with them and instantly become BFFs. This framing makes the growing nature of the frienship obvious.</li>
<li>A friendship is a collaborative activity. You don't make someone your friend, you build a friendship together.</li>
<li>Honestly "make" has weirdly coercive overtones to it that I don't like very much.</li>
</ol>


<p>One of the things that has got me thinking along these lines is how you go about explicitly building (and maintaining) friendships. 
I <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-10-13-10:04.html">wrote a little while back about how explicit decision making is often better</a> but one of the problems here is that making your decision making around frienships explicit inevitably comes off as <em>creepy</em>.</p>


<p>For example, here are two things that have come up:</p>


<ol>
<li>Maintaining a list of friends you want to prioritise and actively trying to spend more time with them.</li>
<li>Having a "frienship onboarding" process where when you want to be friends with someone you can basically just invite them into the process without it seeming strange.</li>
</ol>


<p>Of course, I think most people who are good at frienship are doing these things <em>anyway</em>, they're just not admitting (possibly even to themselves) that this is the case.</p>


<p>To be concrete, I don't do the former but have a friend who does, which I only found out because I mentioned to her that I was thinking about doing it.
I don't <em>really</em> do the latter but I've been thinking about it - some things I do implicitly are in that general shape, and I'm starting to think about making it more explicit.</p>


<p>And in doing so, it sure feels creepy, even from the inside.</p>


<p>Part of this is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8998140-sin-young-man-is-when-you-treat-people-like-things">due to something Granny Weatherwax said</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>sin, young man, is when you treat people as things. Including yourself. That’s what sin is.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(I don't think most people got this lesson from Granny Weatherwax, but it's a widely shared belief)</p>


<p>Starting to build these explicit systems around people sounds very like treating people like things to me.</p>


<p>Friendships though? Friendships are things. Or rather they're systems - a complex set of implicit and explicit agreements and shared knowledge and understanding between people.
Systems are, I think, OK to treat as things, as long as you do so with respect for the agency of the people who make them up.</p>


<p>It still feels manipulative. I think that goes away somewhat by being up front with people about it, but I don't yet know how to do that - even in a culture which successfully promotes overcommunication you still end up with this being a tricky subject.
e.g. the list system is I think good, but once you've admitted its existence people will want to know if they're on it, and it's hard to do that without hurting people's feelings.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The people that live in your head</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-25</dd>
</dl>


<p>There's <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FDrunkestLibrary%2Fstatus%2F1066346270992842752&amp;src=typd">a good Twitter question</a> about books that have changed your worldview for the better. A lot of the ones listed are fiction, including mine.</p>


<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1065381021158449153">related question I asked the other day</a> was about genre fiction provides good role models.</p>


<p>Although the primary purpose of fiction is of course entertainment, the primary <em>benefit</em> of fiction is that it <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2015/03/how-to-make-other-people-seem-like-humans/">fills your head with people</a>.</p>


<p>There's a study from a few years back about how reading fiction improves theory of mind:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Kidd, David Comer, and Emanuele Castano. "Reading literary fiction improves theory of mind." Science 342.6156 (2013): 377-380. </p>
</blockquote>


<p>Their conclusions were that literary fiction does improve theory of mind and popular fiction does not. I'm a little skeptical of this claim - it's not that I doubt their conclusions in the particular experiment, but I think the implications are far less general than they claim.</p>


<p>I think a more reasonable (but perhaps less exciting / conducive to sharpening the axe they want to grind) set of conclusions would be:</p>


<ol>
<li>Reading fiction <em>can</em> improve your theory of mind.</li>
<li>Which fiction you read may have a dramatic effect on how well it achieves that.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example I think reading Pratchett's witches books is likely to have a very strong impact on your theory of mind (it did for me), while reading, say, Xanth might go as far as to having a <em>negative</em> impact on your theory of mind.</p>


<p>That being said, while quality is of course important, I think quantity has a virtue all of its own, as long as there is a reasonable diversity of failure modes in that quantity.
The nice thing about genre fiction is that people can and do read a lot of it, which gives you a large number of people in your head.</p>


<p>This is one of the reasons why having a good range of diversity of authors and protagonists is helpful - it begins to give you a theory of mind that encompasses a wide range of human experience.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How to build a superintelligence</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-24</dd>
</dl>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1066266545213587456">I tweeted the following</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>It's a source of some frustration to me that we've had the capability to build useful functioning superintelligences for about 100,000 years and yet never seem to have taken this capability seriously.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I was asked to elaborate, so this is an elaboration.</p>


<p>Short version: Groups of people are superintelligences. They are reasoning entities that are capable of tasks significantly beyond those of individual humans.</p>


<p>We build groups as superintelligences all the time (albeit often very ad hoc and dumb ones), but what we don't seem to spend much time doing is explicitly designing them.
This is a shame, because there is a lot of interesting low-hanging fruit in this space.</p>


<p>A particularly interesting/frustrating example is from Nigel Cross's "Can a Machine Design?".
In this they experiment with building a "computer aided design" system in which humans take on the role of the computer.
Either the "computer" half of the equation generates ideas and is critiqued by the humans, or vice versa.</p>


<p>This paper is interesting for two reasons:</p>


<ol>
<li>They come up with some interesting conclusions about human/machine collaboration. In particular they suggested that having humans critique computer generated work rather than vice versa was a significantly superior option. The entire industry then went and did the opposite.</li>
<li>They built a system in a day that was in some ways significantly superior to anything we've used since, and then went "huh, that's interesting" and threw it away.</li>
</ol>


<p>Humans are incredibly flexible components in system design, and we're very good at taking on specialised roles.
We mostly don't use these capabilities, and I'm reasonably sure that if we did then we could very easily design reasoning systems that vastly outperform the ad hoc ones we build instead.</p>


<p>An interesting design point in this space is <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a>. They don't explicitly frame their work this way, but it has many interesting characteristics for this problem.</p>

<p>I mentioned this system in passing before but thought it would worth noting down explicitly and commenting on some of its reasoning.</p>


<p>When trying to decide whether to do a close reading of a paper I've started using a points based system.
Ideally I should be able to evaluate this score in about 10 minutes of reading maximum.</p>


<p>I ask three questions:</p>


<ul>
<li>How well written is this paper?</li>
<li>How interesting (to me) is this paper?</li>
<li>How useful (to me) is this paper?</li>
</ul>


<p>Each question gets a score from -1 to 2,
with -1 meaning unusually bad and 2 meaning among the best I've seen recently in that category.
These scores are added together to get a total score for the paper.
A paper with a score of 2 or higher gets read in more detail.</p>


<p>The scoring is slightly odd but basically the reasoning is this gives the following combinations worth reading:</p>


<ul>
<li>One is great, others both neutral or better</li>
<li>One is great, one is good, one is bad</li>
<li>Two are good, remaining neutral</li>
</ul>


<p>In particular a paper has to be doing well on two of these characteristics or amazingly on one of them in order to be worth reading.</p>


<p>While doing the initial casual reading towards, one thing I make sure to do is note anywhere I'm confused and then move on as quickly as possible.
When doing the second reading I start with those points.</p>

<dl class="metadata">

<dd class="post-date">2018-11-19</dd>
</dl>


<p>Unusually for a review, I didn't like this book.
This is a shame as I really wanted to, which is why I finished it, but 'twas not to be.</p>


<p>It's a collection of essays by people talking about rereading books,
usually ones they had read when they were in their teens or younger.
They talked about the impact of rereading and how their views of the books changed as they got older.</p>


<p>The problem was that fundamentally all of these essays were really stories about the authors' lives and how their reading of a book intertwined with that and fundamentally... I just didn't care.
I can see ways it could have worked for me, and I kept reading it hoping to find some gems, but as it stood it was just many brief glimpses into the lives of people I didn't care about viewed through the lens of books I didn't care about.</p>


<p>This is not to say that it's a bad book, but I think it will work well for you only if you are nostalgic for the same kinds of books that the authors are,
and fundamentally my formative years were spent on a diet of science fiction and fantasy, while most of the books talked whistfully about here are the kinds that literature professors read when they want to feel like they're slumming it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Miscellaneous Notes on Vegetarian Cooking</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-17</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm not a vegetarian any more, but I was during a lot of my formative years learning to cook properly, and I think I'm a much better cook for it.</p>


<p>As a result, I get very bored of omnivores' anti-vegetarian-food takes. Vegetarian food is great. Sure, any individual vegetarian dish may not be, but I've seen some pretty disappointing meat-based dishes too.</p>


<p>The reasons people tend to dislike vegetarian food seem to fall into roughly three categories:</p>


<ol>
<li>They're stupid and wrong.</li>
<li>There is a very common style of vegetarian cooking that really <em>is</em> strictly worse than meat-based cooking.</li>
<li>They have mostly been exposed to vegetarian food made by people who don't know how to construct decent vegetarian dishes.</li>
</ol>


<p>What's the common style?
It's what tends to get referred to as "fake meat".
For example, if you go to UK supermarkets, you may get the impression that vegetarians live mostly off quorn.
This does appear to be true of many vegetarians and vegetarianish people that I know.
This is unfortunate because Quorn is made by people who hate joy and want your food to be an endless litany of bland suffering.
Don't eat Quorn.</p>


<p>(If for whatever reason you feel that Quorn adds something of value to your life, by all means eat Quorn, I'm not the boss of you. I just personally think it's an awful substance, and I feel reasonably confident in saying that it's at the root of a lot of negative opinions about vegetarian food.)</p>


<p>In general my recommendation for dietary restrictions is: Unless you absolutely cannot avoid it, do not make any substitutions that you would not be happy to make if that restriction were not in place.</p>


<p>For example I like tofu, especially smoked, and seitan (though I suspect I can no longer eat seitan) a lot. They are interesting things in their own right which you can build a dish around, and they do not in any way pretend to be meat (yes you can get tofu sausages, but personally I recommend you don't. I will concede an affection for seitan based burgers, but they're a thing in their own right and don't taste especially like they're trying to be meat).
You can get quorn that pretends to be meat, and what you will get is a dish that would fundamentally taste better if you had used actual meat instead.</p>


<p>Restrictions are an excuse to try a variety of things that you would not otherwise have tried, and to find new and different points in culinary space.
If you make things that are inferior copies of the unrestricted version of the diet then you will be constantly reminded of how much happier you could be without the restriction in place.
If instead you make things that use the ingredients available to you in interesting and novel ways, you will eat tastier things which will not suffer by comparison.</p>


<p>Sometimes you have to substitute of course. If you can't or won't consume dairy and can't learn to enjoy your coffee black (which is fair enough - I like coffee both ways, but they're very different drinks),
you're going to have to use a non-dairy milk, and unfortunately all non-dairy milks I've encountered work very poorly in coffee. I hear good things about some, but I've never actually encountered it working well myself.
Similarly if you don't eat eggs, you will have to substitute in baking in order to get a good binding agent.
Substituting isn't a point of shame, and it's not something to avoid religiously, but it shouldn't be a primary basis of your diet - you should do it when you can't avoid it or it produces something interesting and different, not just because it's easy.</p>


<p>One of the reasons why substituting works so poorly for vegetarian food is that meat and cheese based dishes have a fundamentally different character to good vegetarian food,
which is that they are built around a single strong primary flavour, with all of the other flavours acting in support of that one.
This is rarely the case for good vegetarian dishes.
Most vegetarian food is built out of a set of mutually constrasting and supporting flavours,
with no single one dominating.
Instead of figuring out what goes well with the centerpiece of the dish, you construct a dish out of components that work well together.</p>


<p>This style is why I think learning to cook as a vegetarian greatly improved my skills as a cook, because it forced me to think about flavour combinations to a degree that would have been less obvious as a meat-based cook.
It's not that these skills don't matter when cooking with meat, but you can get by with developing them to a significantly lesser degree, and most people do.</p>


<p>It's also why I think most vegetarian food cooked by omnivores is terrible, especially vegan food where the lazy option of piling cheese on it is not available:
They still start with a centerpiece, but it's one that is not really suitable as such.
For example, you see a lot of dishes that are basically "Help how do I make a cauliflower interesting?" and the result is something that would be fine as a side dish.</p>


<p>A related problem is that because people aren't thinking about the balance of the dish and the multiple ingredients that go into making it work, they also miss out crucial details.
Protein is the major failure mode here.
It's easy to forget that protein is something you need to explicitly take into account in your dish preparation when the centerpiece of your dish automatically guarantees you have enough of it.
Vegetables, rice, etc. have more protein in than than is commonly recognised, but you should still add more in to your dishes on top of that, and omnivore cooks doing vegetarian food rarely realise that this is the case.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Book Review: Rewriting the Rules</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-15</dd>
</dl>


<p>I have a major problem with this book.</p>


<p>Before I explain what, some context for you.
I have a very strong bias towards short books. This is especially true in recommending them to people.
I'm aware that my reading rate is absurd (I was expecting to finish this book within a single 24 hour period, but a cold which made it hard for me to concentrate meant it was more like a 40 hour period).
Even with careful curation, if I recommend all of the books I read and like to people then it's basically like putting them in front of a book firehose.
Long books are particularly bad for this - a 200+ page book is a serious investment of most people's time. A 300+ page book is probably a month of wall clock time, minimum.
So when I recommend a book of that length, I am basically creating a situation where either I am asking them to devote a huge chunk of their precious time to pursuing my special interest,
or they will feel vaguely guilty for not doing so.
As a result, these days I basically never recommend books this long,</p>


<p>Anyway, back to the book. This book is 335 pages and I really think you all should read it.
I actually feel this strongly enough that I've bought a second copy so that I can shove it into the hands of multiple groups of people I think need it (the rest of you can buy your own copy).</p>


<p>Meg-John Barker is an excellent writer.
This is the third book by them that I've read, and the previous ones I've read ("Queer: A Graphic History" and "How to understand your gender") have been good.
This one is great.</p>


<p>I've been aware of it for a while, but I've always assumed it was basically a manual on how to do poly. I didn't really feel I needed that, so it took me a while to get around to reading it.</p>


<p>That impression wasn't <em>completely</em> wrong, but it was rather incomplete. There is a chapter about monogamy and non-monogamy, and it does discuss a variety of poly relationship types,
but it's less a manual on how to do poly and more a manual on how to do people (in both euphemistic and non-euphemistic senses).</p>


<p>The core message of the book is this:
The social world is made up of narratives that dictate certain rules of behaviour.
Most of what we understand about ourselves, our relationships, and how our gender and sexuality bridge those things, is the product of those narratives rather than an intrinsic property of reality.
Other narratives are possible, and while these other narratives might not be better (and it would not be any healthier to hold rigidly onto them), by maintaining an open and honest attitude,
and by being willing to experiment, we can find new narratives that work better for ourselves.</p>


<p>Most of the book is an excellent practical account of how to find and analyse these narratives in our relationships - with ourselves, our friends, our families, and our lovers.
It is a thoughtful and insightful book that draws on the buddhism, therapy, and a great deal of life experience with LGBT+ issues.</p>


<p>The most immediately useful things about the book for me:</p>


<ul>
<li>It reminded me of just how completely weird normal people are.</li>
<li>I found many of the reflective exercises in it extremely useful for understanding some things about myself that I don't at this time feel comfortable writing about in public.</li>
<li>It has given me a very useful lens to view interactions with others through.</li>
<li>I'm absolutely going to start using "crab bucket" as a pejorative term for people who overly rigidly enforce shitty social norms.</li>
</ul>


<p>I will attempt to write a more insightful post about this book when I have less of a head cold, but honestly just go read it.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of concepts that my brain is still processing and I need to work on a bit more before I can turn them into a real essay,
but here are some interim notes on them that may be useful. They're not fully formed and may be poorly explained.</p>


<p>The two concepts I want to talk about are the experience being <em>illegible</em>,
and marginalisation (with a particular focus on LGBT issues and neurodivergence, because that's what I know about) as a form of <em>combat epistemology</em>.</p>


<p>That sounds very esoteric but I promise you they're both extremely useful concepts.</p>


<p>The notion of legibility comes from James Scott, who is an anthropologist with a focus on anarchism.
I know nothing about James Scott's sexuality or neurotypicality, but his analysis of the similarities between Soviet farm collectivization and 19th Century German scientific forestry turns out to be a very useful tool for understanding LGBT issues.</p>


<p>I'm not fucking with you, honest.</p>


<p>The <em>legibility</em> of something is how easily comprehensible it is in simple terms. Shared land ownership with complex covenants and rights is legible to the few people involved in the process, but illegible to a central government who doesn't really care about the land usage except to the degree that it can tax it. To make it <em>legible</em>, the government insists on a simple land ownership model where one person owns and has sole rights over that land, and they tax that person accordingly. This, being backed by government power, in turn changes the relationship that the locals have with the land, possibly in very negative ways.</p>


<p>There's a classic (i.e. mid 20th century) saying that "the map is not the territory", meaning that the terms and models we use to describe reality are not the same as the underlying reality they describe.
This is true, but Scott's observation is that the map is the tool that those with power will use to reshape the territory,
and they will do so by prioritising their need for comprehension over the needs of the people they have power over.</p>


<p>If you want to know more about the role of legibility in Scott's original analysis of it, I gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8mi1LxtOAc">a keynote</a> about this to a bunch of Python programmers back in 2017.There's also <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/11/shaping-the-world/">a written version</a>, but they don't actually say the same thing because I got up on stage, saw 800 impressionable minds staring back at me, and panicked and all the words went out of my head.</p>


<p>What does this have to do with LGBT issues and neurodivergence?</p>


<p>Well, it comes back to some of the things I described in my review of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-11-12-06:24.html">Trans Like Me</a>.
One of the major experiences of being LGBT, neurodivergent, or (presumably) otherwise marginalised,
is that the tools of interpretation that you need to understand the world are those of society.
It is powerful to have a concept of nonbinary, or asexuality, or aphantasia, or dyspraxia, or any one of dozens other hermeneutical resources (tools of interpretation) available to you.
Having these will significantly improve your life if they are the concepts you need to understand your experiences.</p>


<p>After which, you will find that the fact that you have that concept does not mean that the society around you does,
and they may be actively hostile to acquiring it (A contributory injustice).</p>


<p>What does this mean? It means that you are now <em>illegible to them</em>. You do not fit the simplified model of the world that they have in their head,
and they will constantly be trying to fit you into that model anyway.
Every time you find that the bathrooms only say male or female, or you encounter advice that works great if you're neurotypical and terribly for you and your brain,
or you otherwise fail to fit into the right box, you are experiencing your own illegibility to society.
Every time someone passes a bathroom bill, or refuses to make a venue accessible, or bans plastic straws, you are experiencing society's attempt to legibilise your role in it,
possibly by excluding you altogether.</p>


<p>This is a shared experience of marginalisation: We do not make sense to the broader society, but in all our interactions with it they will try to make sense of us.
They do this not by trying to understand our experience, but by trying to fit us into their own.
This will fail in ways that harm us, because we are illegible to them.</p>


<p>It is also a shared experience of the non-marginalised to a lesser degree: Nobody conforms to society's expectations perfectly, and even those who are close are often in constant anxiety about it.
A large driver of that anxiety is driven by the fear of being weird, which is mostly about having your behaviour be illegible to others.</p>


<p>Now lets talk about combat epistemology (this is a deliberately somewhat tongue-in-cheek term and I'm not that wed to it).</p>


<p>As far as I know this is a term I've made up for what I'm about to describe. I've seen occasional usage of it, but mostly in reference to Charles Stross using it in one of his books.
I think his use is compatible with but a subset of mine.</p>


<p>What do I mean by combat epistemology?
Combat epistemology is the set of techniques that lets you fight epistemic injustice (injustice done to you in your capacity as someone who is attempting to understand the world).
Combat epistemology is the construction of knowledge and understanding while embedded in an adversarial environment.
You need to understand the world, but the world does not want you to understand it.
They deny you information, they feed you lies.
In this environment, how will you come to understand what you need to?</p>


<p>How do you do combat epistemology?
That is an excellent question that I would very much like a good answer to,
but I would like to suggest that LGBT+ and other marginalised communities contain a great many experts in practical combat epistemology,
and identifying them and finding out exactly what it is they do would be a great way to work on this.
For example, Meg-John Barker's "Rewriting the Rules" (which I'm currently about halfway through. Review to follow when I've finished) can be regarded as an excellent handbook in practical combat epistemology.</p>


<p>So, more research is required. In the mean time I would like to tentatively offer the following possible tactics for fighting an epistemic war:</p>


<ol>
<li>Build communities of knowledge around differences and marginalisations and actively discuss the ways in which your understanding of the world is under attack. Attempt to construct a better understanding of the world between you. (Hopefully you are already doing this).</li>
<li>Err strongly on the side of over-communication, at least among people you trust. It is much easier to notice that this is happening if you share your experiences with others.</li>
<li>Actively create tools for understanding the world. Have you noticed something important? Talk about it with other people. Build a language for describing it.</li>
<li>By differing from mainstream society, you become a domain expert on a particular shared aspect of human experience. There are problems you experience more acutely than the norm, and which you have access to more perspectives on, but that doesn't mean that people who lack your shared experience are not experiencing those problems and suffering as a result. This means that you are in a very powerful learning environment for figuring out how to tackle a widely experienced problem. For example, asexual people often understand sexual attraction much better than sexual people. ADHD people know a great deal about attention management. Poly people know a great deal about communication in relationships. These are things everyone struggles to understand, but that some communities do dramatically better than others. Share those tools, both because they will help people and because with their success you will bring the broader society's understanding of the world some way towards your own.</li>
</ol>

<p class="subtitle">Testing if nearness is an equivalence.</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-13</dd>
</dl>


<p>Suppose you have points \(X = \{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}\) and an arbitrary pseudometric \(d: X^2 \to \mathbb{R}^+\).
Let \(\epsilon &gt; 0\).
Can you decide whether the relationship \(x \tilde y \equiv d(x, y) \leq \epsilon\) is an equivalence relationship in better than \(O(n^3)\) time?</p>


<p>You certainly can't do it in less than \(O(n^2)\) time.
Consider \(d(x_i, x_j) = 1_{(i, j) = (u, v)}\) and \(\epsilon = \frac{1}{2}\).
Any algorithm that has not checked all pairs \(u, v\) will fail to distinguish one of these from the pseudometric that is always \(0\).</p>


<p>I'm reasonably confident the answer is that there is no better than \(O(n^3)\) solution but I haven't checked.
I'm just writing this problem down because I popped into my head and I wanted to get it out of there.</p>


<p>Update: No I'm being stupid. There's a general \(O(n^2 \log(n))\) algorithm to check if any reflexive and symmetric relationship is an equivalence relationship.
It works as follows:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">itertools</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_equivalence</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">points</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="p">):</span>

  <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We "fingerprint" each point by the set of points it is equivalent to, turning it into integers we can compare in \(O(\log(n))\) time.
We now test whether every equivalent pair has the same fingerprint.
If yes, then the equivalence relationship is just whether the two points have the same fingerprint.
If no, that witnesses an intransitivity.</p>


<p>I don't know if you can get rid of the \(\log(n)\) factor, but now I <em>really</em> don't care.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Book Review: 100 Ways to Improve Your Writing, by Gary Provost</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-13</dd>
</dl>


<p>I mostly bought this book because of how much I love the following passage:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As you can see in this passage, Provost is very keen on writing in a style that works well when spoken.
Fortunately, this is the objectively correct position, so that's a point in his favour.
In fact, this book made me realise that <em>actually</em> reading out loud is very different from reading in your head,
so I'm going to try to do that more often when writing.</p>


<p>This is one of the best passages in the book, but the rest of the book is also very good,
and contains a large number of useful tips.
It's also very short.</p>


<p>In general the book is very prescriptivist, but it's a <em>good</em> kind of prescriptivism - one that makes it clear that prescriptive suggestions are tools, not laws.
He's quick to point out the limitations of the techniques he suggests, and that no rule is universal.</p>


<p>I also liked the following passage from the conclusion:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Writing is art, not science, and when I finish a piece of writing, I do not review every single one of my tips. I ask, have I communicated well? Have I pleased my readers, have I given them something that is a joy to read? Have I entertained them, informed them, persuaded them, and made my thoughts clear to them? Have I given them what they wanted?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I like this because it not only points out the limitations of the rest of the book,
but also stands alone as an excellent piece of advice in its own right.</p>


<p>I don't agree with everything Provost suggests, but nobody's perfect.
For example he hates footnotes (and parentheses), which I love. The material on research is also quite dated.
Fortunately, because it's a tool box rather than a set of commandments, you are feel free to pick and choose whichever of its tools work for you,
and ignore the ones which don't.</p>


<p>If you're looking to improve your writing, I recommend this book as a useful and accessible way to do so.</p>


<p>On which note, I will leave you with the following quote from the introduction:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>If your writing does not improve after you have read this book, you have not failed. I have. It is the writer's job, not the reader's, to see that the writing accomplishes whatever goal the writer has set for it.</p>

<p>This is an analogy that's been bouncing around in my head waiting for something to glom onto for a few weeks.</p>


<p>I don't think they still do this, but for the longest time my parents had an amusing verbal quirk,
which is that they would refer to the main tower of the desktop computer as "the CPU" (the CPU being actually just a single component of the computer).
They conflated the thing that does the core part of the function of the computer with the entire system - ignoring the fact that a CPU without a motherboard, RAM, a hard drive, etc. wouldn't really do very much of interest.</p>


<p>People do this with brains too. Dualism isn't real, but you are not a brain, you are a body, and your mind doesn't live in the brain, the brain is just the CPU. The mind is the whole box.</p>


<p>(Yes I know brains have memory and long-term storage as well as processing. It's not a perfect analogy, and brains don't work like computers anyway)</p>

<p class="subtitle">Book Review: Trans Like Me</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-12</dd>
</dl>


<p>This book is very good and I think you should read it.</p>


<p>(I am tempted to leave the review at that, but there's interesting stuff in the book that I want to discuss).</p>


<p>This book is patiently but insistently written. It clearly spells out what the trans experience is like, and it pulls no punches in doing so,
but even when CN's frustration with the world was palpable in their writing I never got the sense that they were frustrated with <em>the reader</em>.
It was always "this is how the world is and how it looks to us, I wish to help you get up to speed on a shared understanding of that".</p>


<p>That view of the world is at times very personal, and coloured and shaped by CN's particular experience of the world as a nonbinary person in a particular time, place, and context.
I don't think it could be otherwise, and they make no pretence that it is. They do their best to round it out by referring to the works and experiences of other trans people,
and their best is very good. It is necessarily not "definitive", but no view is. I think this book nevertheless gives a valuable and balanced view that most people (especially people who are not already knowledgeable about trans issues) would benefit from reading.</p>


<p>A while ago I asked about good books about gender to recommend to cishet people, and didn't get any very satisfying answers, but I think this book is a good answer to that question.
Perhaps it would look different to a reader who was actively transphobic, and such a reader would feel like the book was dripping with judgement of them, but I don't think so.
CN is remarkably restrained in that regard. It always feels like they are saying "This is what they (you) are doing and this is how it is hurting us". There are remarkably few places in which I felt like the message was "this is why they are bad people".</p>


<p>The book will doubtless look different again to trans readers.
I believe it would be helpful, especially for people who are just coming to terms with their identity and are thus not necessarily well versed in trans issues themselves, but it's hard for me to accurately say.
I did do some careful googling to make sure that I wasn't about to recommend a book about the trans experience that trans people hated, and as far as I can tell the reception from trans readers has been generally very positive.</p>


<p>What did I, personally, get out of the book?</p>


<p>Well it wasn't news to me that these things happened. I found the description of dysphoria quite helpful - I vaguely understood what dysphoria was, and had heard people experiencing it describe it before, but CN describes their experience of it very clearly in a way that I think helped me to understand a bit better.</p>


<p>Beyond that the specifics were mostly things I already knew, with a few useful details added.</p>


<p>I tweeted the following paragraph from it (page 130 in my copy, in the chapter "Are trans people real?"):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I had, and most likely still have, a tendency toward didacticism. It made me feel superior, when most of my world told me I was wrong. I am so thankful to all the people who have helped me to unlearn the defense of believing my particular truth to be universal. They taught me to really listen to other people, and to accept the limits of my own knowledge. I have never really liked putting my self into words. Listening taught me that the labels that confined me could liberate others. That the right answer for one person could become the wrong answer for another, and that all we could do was lend support in our shared individuality.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This paragraph resonated particularly strongly for me. As a cis man I do not share CN's particular experiences, but this part I feel very personally.</p>


<p>The most important take home from this for me was CN's framing of how this all fits together, and that as a result of that this was an extremely good book on practical epistemic justice (I don't think this is something CN consciously knew they were writing, but perhaps that's what makes it such a good book on the subject).
This is actually the context in which it was recommended to me. I'm not sure I would have consciously picked up on this without that context, but it's a very useful framing of the book.</p>


<p>Epistemic Justice is justice towards people in their role as <em>epistemic actors</em> - people who reason and know about the world, and participate in a community of knowledge.
The concept comes from Miranda Fricker's book "Epistemic Justice, power and the ethics of knowing", although honestly I'd probably recommend just reading "A Cautionary Tale: On Limiting Epistemic Oppression" by Kristie Dotson. It builds on Fricker's work, contains some useful concepts that the book does not, and corrects some limitations in the book's view. It's also much shorter and easier to read.</p>


<p>Part of why I recommend the paper over Fricker's work is that it focuses on what I think is the more powerful of the two concepts in Fricker's work and expands upon it.
Fricker introduces two concepts of epistemic injustice: Testimonial and hermeneutical. Testimonial injustice is the discounting of a person's testimony based on who they are rather than what they say.
This problem is prevalent, real, and very serious, but I think it is already well known (among its targets) that this happens, and I think it is obviously bad even without the framework of epistemic injustice in which to place it. This is not to diminish it as a problem, only to say that I don't think that the view of epistemic justice is <em>that</em> helpful in framing it.</p>


<p>The two other types of epistemic injustice described in Dotson and Fricker's work are <em>hermeneutical</em> and <em>contributory</em> injustice.
In order to explain those I need to tell you what a hermeneutical resource is.</p>


<p>Hermeneutics is the study of interpretation. In the context of epistemic injustice what we are specifically interested in is interpretation of the world, so the tools of interpretation are the tools that we use to construct narrative and meaning that helps us understand the world around us.
A <em>hermeneutical resource</em> is one of these tools - for example a word that describes a concept.
The idea of being nonbinary for example is a hermeneutical resource.</p>


<p>A <em>hermeneutical injustice</em> is an injustice done to someone by denying them the hermeneutical resources that they require in order to understand their experience.
Growing up as a nonbinary person who has been denied the concept of nonbinary is a hermeneutical injustice.
The fact that you had a hermeneutical injustice done to you without having the concept of hermeneutical injustice to explain how it harmed you is <em>also</em> a hermeneutical injustice.</p>


<p>A third type of epistemic injustice, proposed by Dotson as an example that Fricker missed, is <em>contributory injustice</em>.
A contributory injustice is a refusal to add other people's hermeneutical resources to your own,
which denies them the ability to participate as equals in your culture of knowledge.
Imagine (you probably don't have to imagine) someone who refuses to accept the concept of nonbinary as valid.
This is a contributory injustice (and a dick move) - they are refusing to acknowledge the validity of a hermeneutical resource that you use to interpret the world.</p>


<p>Much of "Trans Like Me" can be read as a very hands on account of the contributory and hermeneutical injustices done to trans people, alongside a fourth type of epistemic injustice that I'm not aware of being discussed in the philosophy community that CN refers to as <em>the production of ignorance</em>.
The production of ignorance occurs when you don't just deny people the hermeneutical resources they require to interpret the world, but you provide them with ones that will cause them to interpret the world in a way that is incorrect or harmful.
The mainstream media's presentation of trans rights reliably engages in the production of ignorance, with biased and outright transphobic stories that cause people to paint the experience of trans people in a very different light than is warranted.</p>


<p>As I said, I don't think this view of the book as a book about epistemic injustice is <em>intended</em>, but I think it is a very powerful way of reading it, and doing so has certainly improved my understanding about both the trans experience and epistemic justice, and I am very grateful to CN for that opportunity.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes from TickTalk</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-10</dd>
</dl>


<p>We ran the first play test of <a href="https://github.com/DRMacIver/systems/blob/master/tempo.md">TickTalk</a> recently.
We ended up undoing a bunch of changes I'd made to it and implementing a couple more.
It went it extremely well and was some of the most insight dense conversation I have had in recent memory.</p>


<p>I didn't do note taking during the session because I was trying to focus on the system and also participating and I didn't have enough bandwidth.
Others took notes, but I don't know if they're going to write them up.</p>


<p>Fortunately what I <em>do</em> have is the topics we discussed, so these are my notes based on those and memory.
Note: I'm treating these notes as if we were under Chatham house rule,
so I've not attributed anything to anybody except occasionally me. I don't think there's anything in here that would be at all embarrassing to identify,
but better to err on the side of caution.
Also because I'm going from memory I don't remember who every point or question came from.</p>


<p>These were:</p>


<ul>
<li>What can we learn about meeting design from tabletop roleplaying games?</li>
<li>How do we tackle a conversation where you need to disappoint the expectations of your counterpart? Especially e.g. quitting your job.</li>
<li>What can we use to refocus a meeting that has gone off-topic?</li>
<li>How do you deal with challenging people/conversations in a group?</li>
<li>Remote communication (e.g. via slack) - what are the benefits and draw backs versus face to face communication?</li>
<li>How do you introduce checkins (e.g. making sure that the friend you are interacting with is happy and feeling positive about what you're currently doing) without people feeling they have done something wrong?</li>
<li>How do you decide what your career should be, or what you should do with your life?</li>
<li>How do you notice what decisions you are procrastinating on making?</li>
<li>How do you prioritise how you spend your free time? e.g. Learning things, free time with friends. What are the pros and cons?</li>
<li>How do you talk to people about their privilege?</li>
</ul>


<p>I don't remember offhand which we discussed for five minutes and which we discussed for ten.</p>


<p>I'm going off memory and editorialising heavily, but the following are ideas I remember us generating.</p>


<h3>What can we learn about meeting design from tabletop roleplaying games?</h3>


<p>This turned out not to be a very good question. I intended it as a sort of troll question but annoyingly it was the first that came up.
Some things I liked:</p>


<ul>
<li>Is there an analogue for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNS_theory">GNS theory</a> in meetings? Certainly some meetings have different purposes.</li>
<li>In RPGs there tends to be a single common goal that everyone is working towards (although it sometimes feels like herding cats to get them to do so).</li>
<li>Everyone has to take turns.</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm not sure we learned everything very deep from this question though.</p>


<h3>How do we tackle a conversation where you need to disappoint the expectations of your counterpart? Especially e.g. quitting your job.</h3>


<p>There were two perspectives on this: shit sandwich (something nice, something bad, something nice) vs launch right into it.</p>


<p>We also talked about how much you want to forewarn someone. The use of "Can we have a meeting" gives someone time to prepare, but "I'd like to hand in my notice" is the equivalent of breaking up with someone over text.</p>


<p>We suggested that it helps to make clear that this isn't a decision you've come to lightly, and that you don't think that this is their fault (even if you do think that it is their fault).
Unpack some of the reasons in your meeting, but don't overwhelm them with information - they need time to process.
Offer to send them a written statement elaborating. It may be helpful to write that statement in advance to put your thoughts in order anyway.</p>


<p>Remember that, ultimately, people quitting is a thing that happens, and dealing with that is part of their job as a manager.
Handling it well is a good thing for you to do, but if they handle it badly then ultimately that's your problem.</p>


<h3>What can we use to refocus a meeting that has gone off-topic?</h3>


<p>This went a bit all over the place and I don't remember it very well.
Suggestions I remember:</p>


<ul>
<li>Agreeing on what the focus of the meeting actually <em>is</em> up front.</li>
<li>Getting people to contribute to a written agenda before the meeting.</li>
<li>Having some sort of timer that goes off every five minutes that acts as a prompt as to whether you're still no topic.</li>
</ul>


<h3>How do you deal with challenging people/conversations in a group?</h3>


<p>Depends on the context. It's better to take them aside afterwards and explain the problem than it is to try and confront them in the meeting, especially if they are someone with power, as they will tend to double down.
Try to get them to buy in to the actual point of the meeting.</p>


<p>In a meetup group, if this doesn't work you can just kick them out.</p>


<h3>Remote communication (e.g. via slack) - what are the benefits and draw backs versus face to face communication?</h3>


<p>Remote communication is good for low importance low interrupt stuff ("Can anyone help me with X?" "Hey, Y, when you have a minute I need Z but it's not urgent") so is good for not disrupting people,
but it goes sour fast for things that require nuance or depth. Face to face communication is ridiculously high bandwidth in comparison (we didn't talk about voice calls - probably a good substitute when remote?).</p>


<p>The approach we suggested was start conversations remove but quickly move them face to face as soon as they got in depth.
We talked a bit about one couple who found they always got into major fights over whatsapp but never in person so dialled down their usage of it.</p>


<p>One question I have now writing this up is where things like IRC and Twitter fall in. I've had some amazing conversations on both that would never have worked in meatspace.</p>


<h3>How do you introduce checkins (e.g. making sure that the friend you are interacting with is happy and feeling positive about what you're currently doing) without people feeling they have done something wrong?</h3>


<p>A bunch of good suggestions here. I don't remember enough of them. I hope someone who took notes on this writes this one up.</p>


<p>From what I recall:</p>


<ul>
<li>Explain check ins as a concept before you first need to do them.</li>
<li>Try to start with positive check ins. "I'm really enjoying what we're doing and I think you are to, but I'd just like to confirm that"</li>
<li>Explain things like "I have previously experienced this problem due to lack of communication and like to err on the side of overcommunication as a result. This is part of that..."</li>
<li>Own the fact that what you're doing is weird. "So I know this is weird, but I like to do check ins..."</li>
<li>Get them to hang out with more people in LGBT, poly, and sex positives community and pick up the habits naturally.</li>
</ul>


<h3>How do you decide what your career should be, or what you should do with your life?</h3>


<p>Don't.
Long-term planning is for suckers and vocations are mostly a lie.
Instead work on watching for opportunities, experimenting, doing interesting things, and building a foundation for later.</p>


<p>We talked about a variety of ways of knowing when that's working for you - setting personal goals, journalling, deciding what you're actually getting out of it.
Make milestones in the future to check in on your progress, setting yourself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR">OKRs</a>. Look into the future and telling yourself a story about how it goes if you keep doing what you doing, then seeing how you feel about it.
Journalling and use the journal for emotional processing.</p>


<p>There were some good suggestions here. I hope someone else writes up their notes, because I'm sure I'm forgetting some.</p>


<h3>How do you notice what decisions you are procrastinating on making?</h3>


<p>I think the answers we had here have merged in my head into the answers we had to the previous question.</p>


<h3>How do you prioritise how you spend your free time? e.g. Learning things, free time with friends. What are the pros and cons?</h3>


<p>This mostly became a question about calendaring and todo lists. I only remember two specifics:</p>


<ol>
<li>I proposed using a "GP appointment booking" system to prevent your calendar filling up too far in advance - have a certain number of evenings, weekends, etc. reserved for "emergency booking" that can only be scheduled closer to the time. Someone reported that they already implicitly do something by booking free days in their calendar explicitly and occasionally overriding them closer to the time.</li>
<li>We should spend some of our free time doing more of these because it was great.</li>
</ol>


<p>We also talked about the problem of cycles of overbooking and burnout leading to underbooking.</p>


<h3>How do you talk to people about their privilege?</h3>


<p>I thought this was a good discussion but frustratingly I don't remember the specific suggestions very well.
I remember us suggesting:</p>


<ul>
<li>avoiding the word privilege</li>
<li>trying to frame it more as "here is a perspective you may not have considered" than "this is what's wrong with you"</li>
<li>getting useful books into their reading queue</li>
</ul>


<p>I swear we had some other specific concrete things.</p>


<h3>General Conclusions</h3>


<p>I wish I had been taking more detailed notes, but this was otherwise very good. I think the main things I will take from it are:</p>


<ul>
<li>I really <em>should</em> be doing some sort of OKR setting for myself.</li>
<li>I should try to treat weeks in the future as fully booked when they are only <em>mostly</em> full, and then can fill evenings closer to the time if I must.</li>
</ul>

<p class="subtitle">How to write when writing is hard</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-09</dd>
</dl>


<p>(Lightly edited and expanded upon from a message to a friend. Will turn into something longer at some point)</p>


<p>Meta advice on how to do hard things:
Find things that you can already do that are like the things that you can't do.
Analyse what the difference is, and then try variations where you change one thing about them to make them more like the thing you can't do.
Work on those variations until they are no longer hard.</p>


<p>As a specific application to writing,
the most important thing if you are writing less than you want to be writing is to <em>get comfortable with the basic process of writing</em>.
Write literally anything. Tweeting is writing. All writing counts.</p>


<p>If you struggle with the process of writing, try keeping a journal, where you write whatever you want (it doesn't have to be a diary. I am practically allergic to the concept of keeping a diary for some reasons, but a journal where I just write stuff I'm thinking about down is fine).
The journal is a place for fully unfiltered writing where there is no question of editing it or quality control.</p>


<p>I like journalling. The nice thing about journalling is it's just for me. There is no chance of me ever sharing my journal. I will eat my journal before I let you read it.
This makes it much easier to shut out the inner perfectionist.</p>


<p>If unstructured journalling doesn't work for you, try coming up with some good prompts.
I don't do structured journalling, so I don't have any <em>great</em> suggestions, but maybe start by taking notes on who you saw today and what you talked about.</p>


<p>Back to the meta advice, the following are things that it is common to struggle with in writing:</p>


<ul>
<li>Perfectionism</li>
<li>"What do I write about?"</li>
<li>The actual physical process of writing - typing, hand writing, etc.</li>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>How to structure it</li>
<li>Fear of showing others your work</li>
<li>Knowing when to stop</li>
<li>Turning a complex tangle of ideas into a straightforward linear structure</li>
</ul>


<p>Not everyone struggles with all of these. Most people struggle with more than one of them.</p>


<p>I cannot say this strongly enough: If you are struggling with more than one of them and it is impacting your ability to write then <em>work on a single one of them at a time</em>.
Find a form of writing where that is your only problem and do that until you are comfortable with it.</p>


<p>The problem is that if you are struggling with multiple hard things then a) You are playing on hard mode and b) You are playing on hard mode and <em>learning less than you would be if you were playing on easy mode</em>. Having multiple sources of difficulty means you are trying to figure out multiple problems at once and they're all getting in the way of each other, which means you are getting worse feedback than you would if you were only working on one problem at once. Work on one problem at a time and you will get better at it much faster than if you try to get better at many things at once.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on Lagrangian Duality</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>A long standing failure of mine is that I've never really understand Lagrangian duality,
and it's come up enough times that this is starting to get embarrassing.
The big problem I've always had is that I could follow the logic but I didn't really get why this was at all a sensible thing to do,
so it never really stuck in my head.</p>


<p>Today was dedicated study time for me, and the subject came up again, so I decided to have another crack at it.
I <em>think</em> I've finally understood what's going on, and that the problem I was having was that people kept filling their explanations with distracting details.
I'm sure someone must have explained it to me this way before, for some reason this time I was able to frame it in exactly the right way for me and it clicked.
As such, this may not resonate for you.</p>


<p>The trick for me to was to make the problem more abstract to start with.</p>


<p>Suppose we've got some abstract set \(D\) and a function \(g: D \to \mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty\}\).
Suppose further we've got some \(C \subseteq D\). The <em>constrained minimization</em> problem is that we want to find \(p^* = \inf\limits_{x \in C} g(x)\).</p>


<p>In general this is intractable, but if \(g\) and \(C\) have some special structure we may find it pretty easy. e.g. if \(g\) is a convex function and \(C\) is a convex set,
you can just differentiate or do gradient descent or whatever.</p>


<p>One way to make optimisation problems more tractable is the idea of <em>relaxations</em>,
where you replace the problem with one that is "easier" in the sense that any optimal solution to the harder problem can be turned into a solution to the easier problem that is at least as good,
but not vice versa ("at least as good" is important. For example replacing \(g\) with \(g(x) - 1\) is a valid relaxation, though not a very useful one).</p>


<p>The utility of relaxations is two-fold:</p>


<ul>
<li>they give a <em>lower bound</em> on the optimal solution.</li>
<li>by finding increasingly tight relaxations you may be able to get to the true exact value. e.g. we could add "slop" to the problem that makes it easier by allowing us to get some bits wrong,
  and then iteratively reduce the amount of slop to zero.</li>
</ul>


<p>The easiest relaxation is just to minimize \(g\) over all of \(D\) instead of \(C\), throwing away the constraints,
but this doesn't give us a way of tightening up the relaxations easily.
Other examples of relaxations include e.g. dropping some constraints, allowing an integer valued variable to take arbitrary reals, requiring the constraints to only be satisfied to within \(\epsilon\).</p>


<p>There is one particularly useful class of relaxations.
Let \(\mathcal{F} = \left(\mathbb{R} \cup \{\infty\}\right)^D\) and \(f \in \mathcal{F}\) be such that \(f|_C \leq g_|C\).
i.e. \(f\) can be arbitrary outside \(C\) but on \(C\) it cannot ever exceed \(g\). Let \(R_{g, C}\) be the set of such \(f\).
Then necessarily \(\inf\limits_{x \in D} f(x) \leq \inf\limits_{x \in C} f(x) \leq \inf\limits_{x \in C} g(x)\) - i.e. such an \(f\) is a valid relaxation,
and as such gives us a lower bound on \(p^*\).</p>


<p>Our goal is to choose \(f\) so that it is very large outside of \(C\) and very close to \(g\) inside of \(C\).
If we can ensure that \(|f - g|(x) \leq \epsilon\) inside of \(C\) and that \(f\) attains within \(\epsilon\) of its local minimum in \(C\),
we can get our approximation to within \(2 \epsilon\),</p>


<p>In fact, we can reduce \(\epsilon\) to zero! Pick \(f(x) = g(x)\) when \(x \in C\) and \(f(x) = \infty\) when \(x \in D \setminus C\).
Then we have \(\inf\limits_{x \in D} f(x) = \inf\limits_{x \in C} f(x) = \inf\limits_{x \in C} g(x)\), and so the bound is exact.</p>


<p>Thus we have \(p^* = \max\limits_{f \in R_{g, C}}\inf\limits_{x \in D} f(x)\) - all such \(f\) give us a lower bound on \(p^*\), and there is at least one such \(f\) that achieves that bound.</p>


<p>The problem with this observation is that it is useless on its own - this version isn't any easier to solve than the previous one!</p>


<p>The thing that makes it easier is that we can now consider a restricted subset of \(R_{g, C}\) where this problem is easier to solve.
Unfortunately, this destroys our equality. Suppose we have \(M \subseteq R_{g, C}\), all we can now claim is \(p^* \geq \sup\limits_{f \in M}\inf\limits_{x \in D} f(x)\),
as we might have thrown away the values which are sufficiently close to the maximum as to actually attain it.</p>


<p>The Lagrangian gives us such a family of nicer functions.
Suppose we can define \(C\) as the solution set to \(\boldsymbol{h}(x) \leq 0\) for some vector valued \(\boldsymbol{h}\).
For any \(\boldsymbol{\lambda} \geq 0\) the function \(f_\boldsymbol{\lambda} = g(x) + \boldsymbol{\lambda} \cdot h(x) \in R_{g, C}\),
as we know that \(h(x) \leq 0\) and \(\boldsymbol{\lambda} \geq 0\), so we know that on \(C\),  \(\boldsymbol{\lambda} \cdot h(x) \leq 0\) and so \(f_\boldsymbol{\lambda} \leq g\).</p>


<p>Suppose we can calculate \(t(\boldsymbol{\lambda}) = \inf\limits_{x \in D} f_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}}(x)\) (literally we suppose that. In general we can't, but if \(f\) and \(h\) have some nice form then this is now a simple unconstrained optimisation problem).
By our above discussion we know that \(p^* \geq \sup\limits_{\boldsymbol{\lambda}} t(\boldsymbol{\lambda})\).
This latter quantity is called the <em>dual</em> solution, \(d^*\), and we have proved the primal-dual inequality that \(d^* \leq p^*\).</p>


<p>Why is this a remotely useful thing to do?</p>


<p>Well the main reason is that calculating the dual solution can be <em>much</em> easier for two reasons:</p>


<ol>
<li>It has much simpler constraints - the only constraint is that \(\boldsymbol{\lambda} \geq 0\), so the domain of our optimisation is a particularly simple convex set.</li>
<li>It is the maximization of a <em>concave function</em>. We defined it as the infimum of a number of linear functions (of \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\). They may be highly non-linear in \(x\), but that doesn't matter!), so it is the infimum of a set of concave functions and thus concave.</li>
</ol>


<p>What this means in particular is that what we have is a convex optimisation problem (the function is concave, but we're maximizing it so it's convex optimisation)!
Convex optimisation is easy, so calculating the dual is hopefully easy once you've got to this point.</p>


<p>Note that this is true regardless of literally anything about the original problem - no structure or continuity is assumed (although good luck calculating \(t\) if you don't have <em>some</em> structure and continuity).</p>


<p>Things I still do not understand:</p>


<ol>
<li>When the primal-dual gap is zero (i.e. when the inequality is an equality). I'm aware of some of the theorems about this but I need to study them.</li>
<li>What the actual interpretations of the lagrange multipliers (\(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\)) means. I've seen a bunch of things about "shadow prices" and I had some idea what that meant, but I don't yet understand how that fits in with this interpretation.</li>
</ol>

<p class="subtitle">Dietary Experimentation</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>Content Warning: Food, weight.</p>


<p>Attention Conservation Notice: Person on a diet is talking about the diet he is on.</p>


<p>Disclaimer: I am not a doctor please do not take any of this as professional medical advice.</p>


<hr/>


<p>I'm fucking around with my diet a lot at the moment.
This is a post about some of the things I'm doing, how I'm making them doable, and why I think it makes sense.
It's 50% note to self, 50% explanation of what this weird thing I'm doing is.</p>


<p>This is still very early days, so although initial impressions are positive and I am hopeful about its effects,
it is very much not advice to follow my specific diet.
Even <em>I</em> don't intend to follow this diet indefinitely.</p>


<h3>Background</h3>


<p>As you may or may not know I have a lot of lowgrade ongoing health problems.
I've been considering the possibility that some of these might be diet related for the while but not really doing anything about that.
I recently read <a href="https://blog.valerieaurora.org/2018/11/02/finding-food-allergies-and-sensitivities/">Valerie Aurora's post on the subject</a> in which she lists the following problems as possibly diet linked:</p>


<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Skin problems (acne, blackheads, red spots, redness, scaly skin, oily skin, rashes, etc.)</li>
<li>Fatigue</li>
<li>Depression</li>
<li>Insomnia</li>
<li>Gastrointestinal problems (acid reflux, gas, IBS, diarrhea, constipation, etc.)</li>
<li>Joint pain</li>
<li>Muscle pain</li>
<li>Migraines or headaches</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Frequent colds and sinus infections</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<p>Remember when I said I have low grade health problems? What I mean is I experience <em>literally all of these</em> (except maybe asthma. My doctor is trying to convince me I have asthma, but I disbelieve their statistical methodology. I think I have some sort of non-asthma related breathing problem and all of the interventions they claim allegedly reversed some of it were noise they were pretending was signal).</p>


<p>Some of this is obviously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect">the Barnum/Forer effect</a>. These are all things that "everybody" has to some degree, but I'm an outlier on most of them.
I don't consider this conclusive evidence of anything but it's at least a nudge that this is something I should be looking into.</p>


<p>I identified the following as candidates for suspicion:</p>


<ul>
<li>Brassicas - cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, etc. I <em>know</em> these sometimes gives me issues, so they should be at the top of my hit list.</li>
<li>Alium (onions, garlics, etc) often cause people problems so I added them to the list. Sad face.</li>
<li>Nightshades (peppers, tomatoes, aubergine, etc.). My sister has a food intolerance to these so genetics suggests it's something to watch.</li>
<li>Dairy - known to be a root cause in a lot of breathing problems, something I've had problems with in the past that I thought went away, but possibly they didn't and I just started ignoring them.</li>
<li>Gluten - the classic. It would be silly to not consider that it might be a problem.</li>
<li>Maybe dried pulses (I have noticed some digestive problems from these. Probably not anything atypical but if I'm trying to control digestive problems...)</li>
</ul>


<p>On top of this I've already been trying to <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/07/notes-on-eating-more-vegetables/">eat more vegetables</a>, and I've recently decided to make a concerted effort to lose weight (although haven't been doing a <em>great</em> job) so I've been trying to reduce the amount of carbs I eat on top of that.
While I experiment with the dietary restrictions these are not the priority, but it would be nice to keep them up if I can.</p>


<h3>Approach</h3>


<p>My approach is to change literally everything about my diet.
This probably sounds like a terrible idea, but it's OK - I promise I know what I'm doing.
It's not completely outside the realms of what people advise, and it's something that works well with my particular psychology and health level.</p>


<p>The point of changing everything is not to learn what is causing the problem or to fix things.
The point of changing everything is to find out if there <em>is</em> a dietary intervention that will have a non-trivial effect.
The new diet is not intended for long-term use, but is an existence proof.</p>


<p>I know that the new diet will be safe for me because I don't have anything really badly wrong, just a lot of low grade problems, so I'm free to experiment and basically shunt my entire diet onto a new and very diffierent equilibrium point.
Once I have reached that point and observed the results, I can triangulate between it and my prior diet - reintroducing things, eliminating things, and see what happens as I make incremental changes.
I've <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-10-05-10:00.html">alluded to this approach before</a></p>


<p>So, I'm making the following dietary changes:</p>


<ol>
<li>Eliminate everything on the list of suspicious foods.</li>
<li>Remove almost all of my normal restrictions - e.g. my diet is normally low in meat and contains almost no fish, and I try not to buy snack food.</li>
<li>Generally aim for a high-protein, high-fat, high-fiber diet.</li>
<li>Eat a lot more fruit.</li>
<li>Meals should still be at least 50% vegetables. </li>
<li>As long as I satisfy the above requirements I may eat whatever I want, and I am forbidden from feeling guilty about doing so.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Initial Results</h3>


<p>How's it going so far?
Well, it's a lot of fun.</p>


<p>Yes, really.</p>


<p>There are roughly three things going on here:</p>


<p>The first is what I'm terming "restriction as reward" for the moment, though that name isn't quite right.
Because I have such strong restrictions in place I am <em>explicitly</em> giving myself permission to not feel guilty about what I do once those restrictions are met.
I made <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-11-05-21:01.html">meatballs</a> recently! I bought chocolate! I'm going to experiment with variations on my brownie recipe to finally perfect a gluten-free dairy-free version, at which point I will nom the hell out of them. Although I am putting restrictions in place, the fact that I don't have to think about what I'm eating beyond those restrictions makes the whole thing a mini holiday - here David, have a delicious reward.</p>


<p>(If this causes me to eat too much sugar then I might have to dial it back a bit, but the meat and fish are a pretty big part of the reward aspect and they are an active part of the experiment).</p>


<p>The second is that this gives me an excuse to experiment. I like cooking, and have fallen into a bit of a rut, so this is forcing me to try all sorts of new things that I don't normally do.
Expect a bunch of recipe posts on the notebook as a result.
This aspect is also a useful learning experience for how to cook better for people I know with dietary restrictions, which is always nice (I would describe myself as "good but not great" at this normally. A large chunk of what I cook is naturally almost vegan and almost gluten free, so it's not too hard to adapt that, but it tends to result in food that is on the less interesting end of what I'd normally make)..</p>


<p>The third is what you might think of as the "tube strike effect": When there's a tube strike, a lot of commutes permanently change afterwards, because the constraint forced people to try something different and they discovered they liked it better than their existing system (repeat after me: People are not optimizers).
Trying out these restrictions gives me a kick to find out things that I would like and keep eating even if the restriction is lifted.
For example, I have learned (or possibly been reminded - I can't imagine ever <em>not</em> knowing, but I might not have known that I knew) that fresh pineapple is ridiculously cheap and I really like it.</p>


<p>Is it helping? Hard to say so far, but I think so. Subjectively I feel maybe a bit better. The period since starting it has been <em>incredibly</em> productive, but it's hard to distinguish hypomania from health.</p>


<p>My bowel movements have <em>definitely</em> become more regular. I have dropped almost a kilo in the two days since starting dothis. I'd be alarmed by that fact except that I'm pretty sure I literally dropped it (and then flushed it), so it's probably just a happy side effect of whatever has made me more regular. All of this should be treated firmly as anecdote and not data. </p>


<p>Will report back later.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Book Review: The Knowledge Illusion</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>This book is 80% great and 20% red flags, but that doesn't mean it averages out to a book that is merely good,
instead it is a great book that should be consumed well salted.</p>


<p>What do I mean by this?</p>


<p>Well, I really like the conclusions of the book and it has taught me a number of useful and interesting things,
but it is fundamentally written in a popular science style. This means that its claims are stated with much higher confidence than I think is warranted,
especially given the replication crisis,
and it is often overly credulous about things outside of the authors' area of expertise - apparently blockchain is an amazing technology that is going to change the community of knowledge, and I nearly permanently put the book down when they started waxing lyrical about chaos theory and fractals early on.
I feel like the authors should take their own advice and write causal explanations of the things they are referencing in their book in order to evaluate their own understanding.</p>


<p>But it's a <em>really</em> useful framing of how knowledge, cognition, and understanding work, and I think I would recommend it to everyone despite the above reservations.</p>


<p>The following are some of the interesting things in it:</p>


<ul>
<li>Intelligence is fundamentally <em>action oriented</em> - we are trying to achieve things, and our ability to reason about things is largely in support of that goal. As a result we are much better at causal than logical reasoning.</li>
<li>Cognition is fundamentally <em>embodied</em>. e.g. we don't actually catch a baseball by plotting a parabola in our heads, we delegate some of the computation to our body and the world around us, and use an adaptive method that involves moving around in a way that adjusts our position until we catch the ball.</li>
<li>In the same way we delegate our understanding to the environment, we delegate our understanding to other people. In some sense this is obvious, because nobody can be an expert in everything, but we greatly underestimate how much of our thinking process is delegated.</li>
<li>In particular, we suffer from <em>the knowledge illusion</em> that is the title of the book - we confuse our ability to delegate understanding to the world or the people around us with the understanding itself. If we know that we have access to someone who understands something, or can otherwise acquire the information through experimentation or reading the internet, we rate our understanding of the subject more highly.</li>
</ul>


<p>The titular knowledge illusion is probably the main thing that I didn't know <em>something</em> about before reading this book, but I found the rest of it significantly increased my understanding of it.
I think there is a decent chance that I will do a reread and take copious notes the second time through.</p>

<p>I'm currently starting a restriction diet to cut out a bunch of things, which is about as hateful as it sounds.
It also means that I'm temporarily giving up on my usual restrictions on eating almost no fish and not much meat,
because it's too many restrictions to juggle at once.
This combination means that my cooking is going to go a bit... weird over the near term future.</p>


<p>Anyway, here are the meatballs I made last night. They were pretty good:</p>


<ul>
<li>500g minced pork</li>
<li>Two medium eggs</li>
<li>2/3 cup ground almonds</li>
<li>1tsp salt</li>
<li>1/2 tsp chilli (I realised afterwards that chilli is also something I'm supposed to be restricting, sigh)</li>
</ul>


<p>Instructions: Mix all the ingredients together, smoosh them into meatballs, shallow fry in vegetable oil, turning over as they cook. They're ready when they uh look ready. I didn't exactly do science to that bit.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Doing Mathematics to People</p>

<p>It's very tempting to try to do mathematics to people - trying to model the world and the people in it as a simple mathematical systems.
It's tempting in large part because it is in some sense very effective, but it has a tendency to go quite poorly in a number of ways.</p>


<p>James Scott's notion of <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Legibility</a> is a classic critique of this.</p>


<p>I've been thinking about this and the nature of mathematics a bunch recently, and the other night I managed to express this in a way that I think captures an important feature of my thoughts on the subject.</p>


<p>The problem is this: One of the basic operations of mathematics is that you don't think about an entire mathematical object, you ask what its important properties are - it's a group, it's a topological space, it has a distinguished element with some properties, etc.
This allows you to cleanly manipulate the object by ignoring most of the details about it,
by pruning it down to only its most relevant features.
The problem when you do this to people is that when dealing with real world objects,
the question of what is relevant or irrelevant is an intrinsically political one,
so when doing mathematics to people you're not solving "the" problem, but instead the variant of the problem which is convenient to those with power.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on "Towards a general mathematical theory of experimental science"</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>A friend <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07896.pdf">linked to this paper</a> and I thought it sounded interesting.
These are my first-pass notes. The paper failed to clear my threshold for a close reading, which was a shame because I was quite into it in the abstract.
I would potentially like to do a close reading of something longer on this subject, but I don't feel this paper would be worth the close reading.</p>


<h3>Close Reading Questions</h3>


<p>Scores go from -1 to +2. The threshold for a close reading is that the total score must be 2 or higher.</p>


<ul>
<li>Is this paper interesting? +1</li>
<li>Is this paper useful? -1</li>
<li>Is this paper well written? +1</li>
</ul>


<p>Total score: 1</p>


<h3>Summary</h3>


<p>The general goal here is to provide an abstract mathematical notion of what it means to do experimental science.
I believe they have provided a reasonable basis for doing so, but it is unclear to me what the actual implications of this are and I feel like if they have really been working on it for as long as they say then one of the following must be true:</p>


<ol>
<li>There aren't any very interesting ones.</li>
<li>The authors are weirdly bad at motivating their work.</li>
</ol>


<p>Based on the fact that the paper is reasonably well written and that <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/10/reality-is-a-countably-infinite-sierpinski-cube/">I have also thought about this issue and didn't come up with any very interesting implications</a>,
I am inclined to think that it is the former,
but I hope to be wrong.</p>


<p>Roughly the model of the paper is the following:</p>


<p>We have some abstract set of statements associated with physical reality.
These are closed under arbitrary boolean functions (i.e. if we have some set of statements \(U\) and a function \(f: \mathbb{B}^U \to \mathbb{B}\), where \(\mathbb{B} = \{\text{true}, \text{false}\}\),
we can construct a statement \(f(U)\) which is interpreted as combining the truth values of all of the elements of \(U\) and passing them to \(f\).
This assumption gives the statements (up to equivalence) the structure of a complete boolean algebra.</p>


<p>They consider as a starting point statements which are <em>verifiable</em> - that is, there are is some experimental procedure that would allow us to eventually determine that the statement were true. These procedures are allowed to run for infinite time if the statement is false, but must eventually terminate in finite time if the statement is true.
The verifiable statements are closed under finite disjunction (i.e. if A and B are both verifiable then the statement "A and B" is also verifiable) and countably infinite disjunction (i.e. if \(A_n\) are all verifiable then \(A_1\) or \(A_2\) or \(\ldots\) is verifiable).</p>


<p>They make the interesting (to me) observation that is useful to define an experimental science in terms of two sets of statements:
An <em>experimental domain</em>, which is a set of statements we interpret as being verifiable by some set of experimental procedures and thus is closed under countable disjunction and finite conjunction,
and a <em>theoretical domain</em>, which is the closure of the experimental domain under those operations plus negation. i.e. we can state theoretically things which we cannot verify but can only refute.
This seems like a sensible and useful distinction, and their reasoning for doing so seems sound.</p>


<p>They then define the "possibilities" as the elements of the theoretical domain that are sufficient to determine the truth value of all other statements in the theoretical domain.
These form the points that we are trying to distinguish by experimental procedure.</p>


<p>Probably the key observation of the paper is that these points acquire two natural structures - from the experimental domain they acquire a <em>topological</em> structure,
while from the theoretical domain they acquire the structure of a \(\sigma\)-algebra. This is a nice observation.</p>


<h3>Problems I have with the paper</h3>


<p>My biggest problem is the one I already alluded to above - "OK but so what?". I think the formalism is interesting, but without seeing anything built on it it currently just stands as a pleasing intellectual curiousity.
I don't have a problem with such, but this one doesn't really give me anything to get excited about beyond a sense of "Huh, neat",
and I feel like the authors are treating this as a much deeper result than it actually justifies at present.
If they <em>can</em> show some interesting implications from it, then I would revise this opinion.</p>


<p>I also found some of the formalism a bit sloppy. There are a bunch of places where I've written "???" or "suspish" on the paper that I would want to work through more carefully if I were to do a close reading.
Notably I think they're playing quite fast and loose with the countability arguments, and I am rather suspicious of the claim that statements are closed under <em>arbitrary</em> boolean functions - I would have expected some continuity requirement,
and I think the fact that they don't impose that calls into question some of their other claims about countable generation.</p>


<p>I think these formalism issues can probably be fixed, but as I said I don't plan to do a closer reading of the paper at present, so I haven't worked through the details of how.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Frequentist Statistics as a Tool of Critique</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-01</dd>
</dl>


<p>Epistemic Status: I'm pretty confident this is valid, but I'm not an expert in statistics and I'm even less an expert in philosophy of statistics, so I'm less sure that this is <em>useful</em>,
and if it is then it's probably not novel.</p>


<p>The other day I figured out a framing of frequentist statistics that I quite like,
which is that the core of frequentist statistics is something that you might call the <em>model-based critique</em>.
The model-based critique goes roughly as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>If we accepted your argument, we would also have to accept the following variant of it in an idealised model (where we know the ground truth).</li>
<li>In said model, this undesirable outcome would happen with at least this probability.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, the structure of (two sided) significance testing can be thought of as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>If we accept your argument that this estimator taking this value indicates that the true parameter must be non-zero, then certainly the parameter being <em>larger</em> should count as the same.</li>
<li>Here is a model that produces data that is in some sense like the data that you are testing on, but where the true parameter is zero (the null hypothesis).</li>
<li>Under data generated by this model, the threshold you have set would still report there being a real difference with probability \(p\) (the p-value).</li>
<li>Therefore <em>either</em> you have to explain why the model we have proposed is missing some essential feature of your real process, <em>or</em> you accept that your argument will claim a real result where there is in fact only noise about that often. (which, depending on how often that is, might be fine!)</li>
</ol>


<p>Thus significance testing (and model-based critique in general) is not a tool of inference, but instead a tool of critique - quantitative rhetoric if you will.
It puts forth a counter-argument to a claim that the data is sufficient to support some conclusion or premise.</p>


<p>The thing I like about this framing is that it makes the following three things much more apparent:</p>


<ol>
<li>This is a valid thing to do.</li>
<li>It's even a <em>useful</em> thing to do.</li>
<li>It's not, however, a tool of inference, but instead a tool of refutation. When something is "statistically significant" what that means is <em>we have failed to convincingly argue against it</em>, not that it is true (or even likely!).</li>
</ol>


<p>It's also nice that it's much more explicit about the relationship between the model and the experiment.
I think most normal framing of frequentist statistics pretends that the model is in some sense true,
while that is not an important feature of the model-based critique - instead it merely has to be a convincing analogy.</p>


<p>This framing has also shifted my opinion of frequentist statistics. It's not that I like it more or less, but previously my attitude was mostly "Eh, whatever. It's not my favourite thing, but I don't think I have a strong opinion on this and it's not one of the battles I choose to fight" while now I think the following:</p>


<ol>
<li>Frequentist statistics is a useful and valid tool and most of the criticisms of it are, I think, treating it as trying to do something that it's not (and, in fairness, most of the <em>proponents</em> of it probably are too).</li>
<li>Most of the way that it's used in practice by people with a typical scientist's level of understanding of statistics are probably deeply flawed.</li>
<li>It's probably easier to get people to stop using p-values than it is to get them to acquire the level of statistical sophistication that allows them to be a useful tool.</li>
</ol>

<p class="subtitle">Book Review: The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-11-01</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'd been idly considering reading this for some time, and a little while back <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1052476190080913408">asked on Twitter</a> what people thought of it.
The review that tipped me over the edge was "It's probably much weirder than you're expecting". It was much weirder than I was expecting.</p>


<p>I enjoyed the book and will be changing my habits as a result of it, but I do not at present plan to follow the system.
However, precommitment: If I have not got my room in a state where by May 18th 2019 (my 36th birthday) I can honestly say that I feel like my rom is reliably sufficiently tidy, I will follow the KonMarie system and do a big clear out.</p>


<p>Why?</p>


<p>Well, three reasons:</p>


<p>The first is that I have a deep seated distrust of anyone who says "This Is The System And Thou Shalt Not Deviate From It".
I acknowledge that given an optimal system this is the correct thing to do and the temptation to deviate from the system is stronger than the benefits of adapting it,
but my priors are strongly against any given system being proposed being anywhere close to optimal.</p>


<p>The second is probably my biggest objection to the book: I am really deeply personally offended that someone could spend so much time developing a system centered around throwing away stuff without spending some time thinking about how to responsibly throw things away. At some point she talks about how she's been responsible for clients discarding 28,000 bags of stuff, which is probably 28,000 bags of stuff taking up space in a landfill somewhere (I don't know how garbage disposal works in Japan. Maybe it's incinerated instead, which would be better but is instead 28,000 bags of rubbish worth of carbon footprint). So I'm on board with the idea of getting rid of things but want to figure out how to do so responsibly.</p>


<p>The third is that I understand her argument about storage but still think she's wrong. A lot of the problem with my current setup <em>is</em> storage space - not that I don't have enough of it, but that what I have is poorly designed, and I do think I need to resolve that problem before I can get things to a decent state.</p>


<h3>So what am I going to do?</h3>


<p>I said I'm going to change things as a result of this book, so here is a list of things that I am changing as a result of this book:</p>


<ol>
<li>I am donating a lot of clothing. I have a large bag that I'll be taking to the Samaritans this morning (chosen honestly for no other reason than there's a Samaritans shop that takes donations easily walkable from here).</li>
<li>I'm getting a weekly pill planner. I have a lot of pill related clutter right now due to a variety of daily supplements and medications I'm on, and this will help me pack all of that away in a better location.</li>
<li>I'm going to dump a bunch of books on the popup library in my local underground station.</li>
<li>I'm going to ask my university library if they take book donations - I have a bunch of weird textbooks that I'm realistically never going to use but that will just get pulped or ignored if I take them to a charity bookstore or the popup library.</li>
<li>I'm getting a Kallax shelving unit with inserts. My current book storage is a pair of stacked vertical book shelves and honestly they look awful and area  aterrible use of space. The Kallax unit will be a much more effective and attractive way of storing books and has enough additional storage as to remove all plausible deniability: if I'm running out of space after I have the Kallax unit then there is no way to pretend that it is because I have too much stuff rather than not enough storage.</li>
<li>I am going to be getting rid of the desk in my room (which I literally never use) and a half-finished computer assembly project that I honestly am never going to whole-finish, and take the relevant peripherals to work where I would find them actually useful.</li>
<li>After that we'll see. As per above, I precommit to following the KonMarie method properly if a combination of the above and whatever naturally comes next does not successfully sort my shit out.</li>
</ol>

<p class="subtitle">Notes from London Liberating Structures 2018-10-30</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-31</dd>
</dl>


<p>Yesterday was my second London Liberating Structures, where we did two different Liberating Structures.
These are my notes from them.</p>


<h3>Notes from Discovery &amp; Action Dialogue</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/10-discovery-action-dialogue/">Discovery &amp; Action Dialogue</a> is a structure for identifying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_deviance">positive deviance</a>: Given some widespread problem, some people fare better than others at it than others. Can we identify and copy those strategies?
The question we asked was "How can we improve our London commute?".</p>


<p>DADs have seven structuring questions, but we combined the last two.</p>


<h4>How do you know when problem X is present?</h4>


<p>We identified three major types of problem we have with our commutes:</p>


<ul>
<li>"Lost" time - when the commute is such that you can't actually do anything else useful on it because it's too crowded to e.g. read a book.</li>
<li>Physically unpleasant, due to crowding, heat, air quality, etc.</li>
<li>Unpredictability can be a source of stress - if you might get delayed getting somewhere as a result of train cancellations, etc.</li>
</ul>


<h4>How do you contribute effectively to solving problem X?</h4>


<p>We identified a number of strategies we used:</p>


<ol>
<li>Replace your "optimal" route with a slower but more predictable or pleasant approach. e.g. We talked about:<ul>
<li>Using the Thames Clippers boat.</li>
<li>Alternate tube routes that involve slightly more walking (e.g. I rearranged my commute to involve walking from Lancaster Gate to work instead of Gloucester Road - it's a 15-20 minute walk instead of a 10 minute walk, but it's a bit faster so you hardly lose any time on it and the walk across Hyde park is <em>much</em> nicer).</li>
<li>Taking the overground instead of the underground - less crowded, so you have more space to read a book.</li>
<li>Motor biking, biking, or even walking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When there's nothing else you can do due to crowding, people suggested they used podcasts for this.</li>
<li>Be better about advance planning - e.g. think about your layers, balance of your bag, etc. so that it's easy to adjust your comfort and temperature level when you're on the tube.</li>
<li>Working from home and flexible working hours - if you can avoid commuting during rush hour, the problem mostly goes away.</li>
<li>Leave earlier when it's less crowded and schedule something before work - e.g. swimming, meeting someone for coffee, morning glory.</li>
</ol>


<h4>What prevents you from doing this or taking these actions all the time?</h4>


<p>A mix of being bad at organisation and constraints outside our control: e.g. if your job is not one you can do from home then you're basically stuck as to when you commute.
If you don't live and work near to the river you can't take the Thames Clippers</p>


<h4>Do you know anybody who is able to frequently solve problem X and overcome barriers? What behaviors or practices made their success possible?</h4>


<p>We didn't really have any suggestions other than the ones we already said in "How do you contribute effectively to solving problem X?" (though there were a few things that got brought up here that were basically "Oh yeah I forgot to say...") and "people who are more organised than me"</p>


<h4>Do you have any ideas?</h4>


<p>The main useful ideas we had were:</p>


<ul>
<li>Bring a thermos of tea or coffee on the tube (I'm not sure how this fits in to any of the specific problems we suggested, but apparently it makes it more pleasant).</li>
<li>Encourage working from home more where possible. Even if you don't do it all day, work from home in the morning so you don't commute during rush hour. We highlighted that unfortunately there's a culture of shaming around this.</li>
<li>Experiment with your route - try alternatives to see if you like htem better.</li>
</ul>


<p>We also talked about things councils could do - e.g. making more bus lanes suitable for motorbike use.</p>


<h4>What needs to be done? Who needs to be involved?</h4>


<p>This rather blended into the previous section to be honest - I'm not sure there was much of a noticeable difference between the sort of things we suggested in this and the previous section.</p>


<p>The ideas we suggested in this section were:</p>


<ul>
<li>Shifting cultures to make working from home more acceptable - e.g. calling out "jokes" about working from home as not OK.</li>
<li>More vehicle free areas and times.</li>
<li>More tube strikes! (This was in response to the observation that tube strikes often result in long run improvements to people's commutes as they find routes they like better)</li>
<li>Restructure our entire economy to move more jobs out of London so this is less of a problem.</li>
</ul>


<p>We made the observation at this point that almost all of our solutions were about mitigating or avoiding the problem rather than really solving it.</p>


<h3>Notes from 15% Solutions</h3>


<p><a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/7-15-solutions/">15% solutions</a> is a structure for identifying immediate points of action - what can you do to improve the situation right now without requiring any additional resources or authority.</p>


<p>I don't have any detailed notes from this because I forgot to bring my journal with me. Fortunately <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/">Alex</a> assures me that he will be writing up his (and we were in the same group).</p>


<p>We discussed the question "What can we do to address power imbalances in meetings?". What I remember of <em>my</em> suggestions were that I had roughly two categories of suggestion: Roughly, "better structures for meetings" and "develop ally skills".</p>


<p>In the former I suggested:</p>


<ul>
<li>Use liberating structures!</li>
<li>Develop a culture of hand signals as a parallel communication channel (easier for people who have difficulty speaking up).</li>
<li>Arrange a meeting agenda in advance in writing, with everyone contributing.</li>
</ul>


<p>For ally skills I suggested the following:</p>


<ul>
<li>Exemplify behaviours that you want people with less power or experience to be able to do. e.g. I try to ask "stupid" questions to encourage the notion that it's OK to do that. Similarly I try to be good about admitting when I don't understand.</li>
<li>Checking in with people after meetings to see what they thought about it (especially useful to do if you're <em>not</em> the person running the meeting)</li>
<li>Signal boost people when their point seems to have got ignored - "I think X made a good point when they said..."</li>
</ul>


<p>Alex also suggested note-taking as a good tool here. There are two senses in which this is true: It can be very useful for making sure you give credit where credit is due, and also if there is some sort of formal minutes process where someone is expected to volunteer themselves, often that ends up going to a woman (being aware of this dynamic is part of why I almost always volunteer as note taker. The other part is that I'm decent at it and it helps me focus on the subject being discussed)</p>


<h3>General Reflections</h3>


<p>I'm afraid neither of these landed for me. I liked the idea of both and would be up for doing them again, but the specific instances as we did them didn't work.</p>


<p>Part of this is due to something I left as feedback for the organisers already: I do not think there is enough time to do two liberating structures in two hours. This is especially true because there's a break in the middle and because people arrive on London time, so two hours isn't really two hours, it's at best about an hour and a half, less if you don't count explanation time.
The result was that the DAD felt a little rushed and the 15% solutions was too rushed to do anything meaningful with.</p>


<p>Personally, I think I would also like a more in depth discussion of the structures before we did them (in theory I had read the sections in the book before hand, but in practice I didn't remember anything from what I read).</p>


<p>I also had some specific complaints with both structures.</p>


<ol>
<li>I thought DAD's structuring questions were too unstructured, and the timing was insufficiently clear. I also thought the problem we were talking about was not really shared reliably enough among the people involved - the problem was that everyone had such different constraints that we didn't have much in the way of solutions we could transfer.</li>
<li>I did not think that 15% solutions worked without more careful timekeeping than we did, and by the time we got to the second round everyone had forgotten people's specific suggestions from the first round. I think it would have worked much better if people had given their suggestions and then immediately been asked the clarifying questions (with a time box per person). This makes it somewhat closer to <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/8-troika-consulting/">Troika Consulting</a>. </li>
<li>I missed having the talking objects aspect from conversation cafe.</li>
</ol>


<p>All that griping aside, I still found it an enjoyable evening and an interesting experience - although I didn't think the structures worked for their intended purpose, it was still useful to try them out and observe their failure modes.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on Blocking Sets</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-31</dd>
</dl>


<p>Here's some stuff I'm playing with related to some problems in the combinatorics of test case reduction.</p>


<p>Let \(X = \{1, \ldots, n\}\).</p>


<p>Let \(S \subseteq X\) and \(\pi\) be a permutation of \(X\). Say \(S\) <em>starts</em> \(\pi\) if \(S = \{\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_{|S|}\}\).</p>


<p>Let \(B \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)\). Say \(B\) blocks \(\pi\) if \(S\) starts \(\pi\) for some \(S \in B\).
If \(B\) blocks every possible \(\pi\), say it is blocking.</p>


<p>Lemma: Suppose \(B\) is a blocking set such that \(k \leq |U| \leq n - k\) for all \(U \in B\). Then \(|B| \geq n\choose{k}\),
and this bound is tight.</p>


<p>Proof:</p>


<p>To see that the bound must be tight note that the we can choose the set of all subsets of \(X\) of size \(k\),
and this is a blocking set of the desired size.</p>


<p>Suppose now that \(|B| &lt;  n\choose{k}\). Pick a permutation \(\pi\) uniformly at random. For each \(k\), \(\pi\) starts with each subset of \(X\) of size \(k\) with equal probability.
Thus for any given subset of size \(k\) the probability that \(\pi\) starts with it is \(\frac{1}{n\choose{k}}\).
Thus the expected number of sets in \(B\) that start \(\pi\) is \(\sum\limits_{U \in B} \frac{1}{n\choose{|U|}} \leq \frac{|B|}{n\choose{k}} &lt; 1\).</p>


<p>If the expected number of sets that start \(\pi\) is less than one, then the probability of it being equal to zero must be non-zero. In particular,
there is some \(\pi\) that does not start with any of these sets, and thus is not blocked by \(B\). Therefore \(B\) is not blocking.</p>


<p>QED</p>


<p>The question I'm really interested in is the following:</p>


<p>Say \(S\) is a critical set for \(B\) if \(B\) is non-blocking but \(B \cup \{S\}\) is blocking.</p>


<p>Suppose \(B\) is some non-blocking set such that \(|U| \geq 2\) for all \(U \in B\), and suppose that \(B\) has a critical set of size \(2\).
How small can \(B\) be?</p>


<p>I believe the answer is that it most have at least \({n - 1}\choose{2}\) elements, but I keep failing to pin down the details.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The No Genies Conjecture</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-31</dd>
</dl>


<p>A thing I often end up explaining to people is that in testing you can go broad or you can go deep: Example-based testing tends to be deep, property-based testing tends to be broad. There's no real way to go broad and deep at once other than doing a stupid amount of work.</p>


<p>A similar dichotomy is between physical and digital tools. Physical tools tend to be flexible but limited power, while digital tools tend to be powerful but inflexible. There are very few tools that are both powerful and flexible without you having to do an awful lot of work.</p>


<p>Roughly there's a "pick two" thing going on between:</p>


<ol>
<li>Powerful</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
</ol>


<p>If you're lucky you get one of these. If you're <em>really</em> lucky you get two. You basically never get all three.</p>


<p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111">Except in fiction</a>. A genie's wishes are powerful, flexible, and easy to use.</p>


<p>Thus, one might reasonably term the statement that you cannot have all three of these things at once as the conjecture that genies do not exist.</p>

<dl class="metadata">

</dl>


<p>When I mentioned to a friend that I was reading this she said "Oh is that actually good? I assumed it was pop science trash". It is actually good and it's not pop science trash.</p>


<p>There are roughly two interesting bits to this book:</p>


<ol>
<li>Advocating for a particular attitude to life.</li>
<li>A lot of anecdotes about space and what the life of an astronaut is like.</li>
</ol>


<p>I found both sides of the book interesting, although I think the life advice would have fallen very flat without the space component,
while the space component might have stood just fine on its own.</p>


<p>Some of the attitude stuff that is advocated for:</p>


<ul>
<li>work hard</li>
<li>over plan for everything</li>
<li>be a team player</li>
<li>don't be afraid to shoot for your ultimate goal but arrange your life so that if you don't achieve it that's OK</li>

<p>I've been thinking about trying to get better at strategic planning, and this book was a useful nudge in that direction.
In particular there's a bunch of advice in there for <em>constructively</em> over-thinking things which might be useful.
The main gist is that rather than worrying about everything that might go wrong and stressing about it as a result,
worry about everything that that might go wrong and <em>plan what you will do when it does</em>.</p>

<p>Decent introduction to systems thinking. Not super useful for me given that it was a bit preaching to the choir, but helped fill in some gaps and I'd recommend it as an intro for people who <em>don't</em> naturally think this way.</p>


<p>I found some of the examples a bit dated and the politics a little annoying in a few places. I also feel like it was less actionable than the author believes it to be. All told though it's a nice, clear, and enjoyable read.</p>

<dd class="post-date">2018-10-26</dd>

<p>This a lovely book that I can't really easily summarise. It's a melancholy exploration of our relationship to the world, through the lens of loss and what it means to be lost.</p>


<p>One thing that was interesting for me personally when reading it is how very clearly it is the sort of book which I could never possibly have written.
I don't just mean that the author is a much better writer than me (although she absolutely is), but the nature of our relationships with memory are very different:
The book is full of detail-rich memory of her life, with the themes she's discussing being woven in and out and illustrated with personal stories and how they played out in those cases.</p>


<p>I simply don't have that sort of memory, which makes it very hard for me to... relate is not the right word, because I can absolutely relate, but I cannot imagine what it would be like to have that level of access to my history. Usually this just feels normal, but being confronted with how wide that gap is is a strange (and, indeed, lost) feeling.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Deleting larger intervals in test case reduction</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-26</dd>
</dl>


<p>So here's a surprising fact I just noticed.</p>


<p>Suppose you've got some sequence \(S\) and a predicate \(p\) and you want to do test-case reduction on \(S\) with respect to \(p\).</p>


<p>Classically we try to get the result to be one-minimal. I'm <em>pretty</em> sure that by choosing \(p\) carefully you can always force this to require \({|S|\choose 2}\) evaluations of \(p\). You certainly can with the greedy algorithm. See <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/313669/what-is-the-minimum-worst-case-length-of-an-element-removal-game">this mathoverflow question I asked about generalising</a>.</p>


<p>A stronger condition you might want is what you might call <em>interval</em> minimality. That is you want to find \(S'\) with \(p(S')\) such that \(p([S_1', \ldots, S_i', S_j', \ldots, S_n'])\) is false for any \(i &lt; j\).</p>


<p>The funny thing is that these tasks have the same worst case complexity.</p>


<p>If you run the brute force algorithm that tries to delete each interval of length \(k\) at a time, increasing \(k\) when that fails, if you delete an interval of size \(m\) then this takes you worst case \(m \frac{2n - m + 1}{2}\) evaluations, but it decreases the size of the sequence by \(m\). By doing induction and seeing where the maximum lies, this means that the actual number of predicate evaluations to get to a fixed point can also never exceed \({|S|\choose 2}\).</p>


<p>The <em>typical</em> case is generally not going to be as good, but it's interesting that the worst case is the same.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Vegetarian Lasagne Recipe</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-24</dd>
</dl>


<p>(Writing up a vegetarian lasagne recipe I made the other day because I've been getting requests).</p>


<p>This has four ingredients:</p>


<ol>
<li>Crown Prince Squash, cut into roughly 2cm cubes and roasted in butter (you can use oil if you like. In general this recipe has a lot of butter)</li>
<li>Wholewheat lasagne noodles</li>
<li>Grated Mozzarella </li>
<li>Very Red Sauce (recipe for this below. This is the only labour intensive bit)</li>
</ol>


<p>Crown Prince Squash are much much better than butternut squash and are thankfully in season at the moment.
They <a href="https://www.suttons.co.uk/Gardening/Vegetable+Plants/All+Vegetable+Plants/Squash+Crown+Prince+3_242931.htm">look like this</a>.
I get mine from West Hampstead Farmers Market, which is open on Saturday 10:00-14:00, where they are fairly cheap (£2.50 each, which means £5 gets you more squash then you will probably want to eat in a week).
I think a bunch of the middle-eastern and organic vegetable stores in that area also sell them on other days.</p>


<p>To make it you stack layers:</p>


<ol>
<li>Squash</li>
<li>Very red sauce</li>
<li>Noodles</li>
<li>Very red sauce</li>
<li>Mozzarella</li>
</ol>


<p>I usually do two of these on top of each other, with extra mozzarella on top for extra crispy cheesiness.</p>


<h3>Very Red Sauce</h3>


<p>This is basically just a rich vegetarian, vegetable heavy, tomato sauce with some variations.
Unfortunately there's no real formal recipe because I improvise it each time, so this is mostly reconstructed by guess work. Feel free to adapt it or substitute some standard recipe.</p>


<p>It's best made the day before and left to sit overnight on the counter (if you're not feeling brave you can skip this bit) and then in the fridge.</p>


<p>The way I make this is very dependent on having both a food processor and a pressure cooker. You can almost certainly make it differently without those.</p>


<p>The following makes enough for two large lasagnes:</p>


<ol>
<li>4 medium sized onions</li>
<li>4 large carrots</li>
<li>4 medium sized beetroot</li>
<li>1 liter of tomato passata</li>
<li>1 can chopped tomatoes</li>
<li>250g salted butter (yes, you're reading that right)</li>
<li>A lot of black pepper</li>
<li>Two large spoons of marmite</li>
<li>5 or so bay leaves.</li>
</ol>


<p>You shouldn't add any salt to this - between the butter and the marmite it's got plenty believe me.</p>


<p>First roast the beetroot. Once it's roasted, peel it (I use kitchen gloves for this - the skin should just come off once it's roasted).</p>


<p>Dice the onions, and put them in the pressure cooker with the butter and lots of ground black pepper.
Leave them on a medium heat to brown.</p>


<p>While those are browning, peel the carrots, then grated them and the beetroot (this is where the foot processor comes in - I just use the grater extension). Add these to the onion, stir them together, and leave to cook for a while longer - say 20-30 minutes.</p>


<p>Once that's looking cooked (unfortunately you can't judge this in a pressure cooker, so I do guess work plus putting it back on if it's not ready), add the tomato, bay leaves, and marmite, stir thoroughly, and then cook on a low heat for an hour or so.</p>


<p>After that, the sauce is ready except for the waiting. Really do leave it overnight - it will be much better the next day.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Book Review: All The Lives I Want by Alana Massey</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-23</dd>
</dl>


<p>Reasonably strongly recommended.</p>


<p>This is a collection of essays about the lives of famous women, and the author's life, and the experience of being a woman.</p>


<p>Confession: When this book arrived from Amazon I went "Wait, why did I order this again?". Fortunately past me was wiser than other-past me and it was a good order.
I'm pretty indifferent to a lot of popular culture, so many of the people referenced in this book were ones I didn't or barely recognised. That didn't really matter.</p>


<p>This is another book that is slightly meandering and personal in the way that I complained about for Writing to Learn. Unlike Writing to Learn, that was fine - I never felt that the book should get to the point, because the story it was telling <em>was</em> the point.</p>


<p>I don't have a good summary of the book, except perhaps that it's about giving a sympathetic eye to women who do not normally get one, and it does that very well. It's not exactly a light read - the content is at times fairly distressing - but it is well written and to the point in a way that means it also never feels like a heavy one.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Book Review: Writing to Learn</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-21</dd>
</dl>


<p>The biggest problem with this book for me is that it is not really <em>about</em> writing to learn, instead writing to learn is better thought of as its recurring theme.</p>


<p>The book exemplifies a style that it also advocates for: Personal, privileging peple over knowledge. Every piece of information should be presented in the context of a story, and about how the people relate to that knowledge.</p>


<p>I'm not a huge fan of this style. I think it can work, and certainly personal books of the type it encourages are fine (and sometimes even great), but as a way of presenting knowledge I think it fails. The point being made is obfuscated by being tangled up in the story, while the story suffers because I'm constantly thinking "OK get to the point" and thus want to rush through the story.</p>


<p>As, frankly, happens in this book. The book is well written, and contains a lot of interesting examples of good writing. I think if I hadn't been wanting to learn more about its actual theme of "writing to learn" and just sat back to enjoy it as a piece of writing I would have liked it a lot more.</p>


<p>The actual structure of the book is roughly this:</p>


<ol>
<li>The fact that writing is left to the English department to teach does an injustice to the student and to the teachers - writing is better integrated across the curriculum.</li>
<li>A couple of useful pieces of information about how to integrate that.<ul>
<li>Get people to use writing to make their reasoning process explicit.</li>
<li>Require well-written essay answers on exams, but if an answer is correct but poorly written, give students an opportunity to revisit it, with the help of a writing workshop.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A very large number of anecdotal and extract evidence of the fairly obvious proposition that yes you really can write well in any field.</li>
</ol>


<p>I'm particularly disappointed by the third part because almost none of these felt like examples of people writing to learn - they were almost all examples of writing to teach.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Compare and Contrast: Big Capital vs Radical Markets</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-17</dd>
</dl>


<p>Copied and expanded upon <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1052592117879463937">from Twitter</a>.</p>


<p>I said in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-10-16-10:42.html">my review of Big Capital</a> that I didn't think I'd got a lot out of it other than being sad and angry, but actually one thing I've gotten out of it is that I think it's helped me put my finger on why the property model in Radical Markets is so dangerous.
The problem is that you end up effectively charging people for community - people put down roots, form connections, etc. This creates an unwillingness to move that means that the value to the incumbent is significantly greater than the value to the purchaser.
Either this is reflected in their personal valuation of the house (which means they are taxed more) or they inevitably lose value when someone buys their house from under them.
As well as being very class correlated that's an awful incentive gradient you've got there.</p>


<p>The way this has played out in London is in the context of council housing, where people who have bought their homes under right to buy schemes have been met with mandatory purchase orders from the council where they want to redevelop the estate.
The COST model proposed by Radical Markets is basically a form of mandatory purchase order - you don't have the same injustice over being paid below market rates (except in the sense that "market rates" are set by what people can afford to pay in their COST taxes, and estates typically house poorer people!), but other than that the effect is the same.</p>


<p>This destroys communities, and because these are the communities that people have built their lives in and around, that destroys lives.</p>


<p>Anyway, given that it has helped me make sense of something important, I tentatively revise my review from "Very good but I can't recommend it" to "Very good, will make you sad and angry, but may help you make sense of some things around property and is a useful counterpoint to Radical Markets, and I leave the cost-benefit analysis to you".</p>

<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-16</dd>
</dl>


<p>This was a good book that I don't think I can really recommend.</p>


<p>It's a compassionate, well-written, account of the extent of the problems with treating London property as an investment vehicle,
the extent of the personal cost to people, and the degree of culpability of the councils in this problem.
I knew much of this, but it filled in a lot of details for me.</p>


<p>I was very impressed with how level a tone the author managed to keep throughout the book. The style would have been almost painfully dry, except that the material has such a high emotional impact and the writing is sufficiently concise and to the point as to offset the worst of the dryness. Instead it is a very effective accounting of the situation we find ourselves in. I don't think I could have written anything like it without calling for open revolution.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, I don't know what to do with that information, so the book just made me angry and sad, and I was already angry and sad about this.
Some concrete proposals were made in the last chapter, and they seem like good ones, but they're not ones where I feel like I have much agency, and to the degree that I have agency I would probably spend it on other things.</p>

<p>I thought this was a good book, and I would recommend it to people who either are trying to do just that, or to people who want to understand a bit more about what others go through in this space.
It's well written, reasonably thorough, and provides sensible, compassionate, advice.</p>


<p>I didn't personally get a huge amount out of it. This is partly because I've already had a lot of these discussions and done a lot of the relevant reading, partly because I sped through it rather than doing the reflective exercises they encouraged, and partly because my own relationship with my own gender could perhaps best be described as "mild antipathy" - other people talk about gender as this deeply felt lived experience, and it's not something I can relate to at all (I think <a href="https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/01/28/cis-by-default/">Ozy Frantz's notion of "cis by default"</a>) is helpful here. The result is that the book was written as if a lot of its content should have deep emotional impact and, while I think this was the correct way to write it, a lot of it failed to land for me.</p>

<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-15</dd>
</dl>


<p>A surprisingly charming book. It sounds like it should be funny, but it's not (and I don't think is intended to be).</p>


<p>Instead the author, a literature professor, discusses the roles of books in our lives, and how they are interpreted and exist within our cultural framework and views on the world.</p>


<p>One of his key points is that there is not really a binary of books we have "read" versus "not read" - every book we have read, we immediately start to forget, so at some point even books we have ostensibly read may achieve the same status as books we have never read.</p>


<p>He uses a cute set of categorisations: UB (book that is unknown to me), SB (book I have skimmed), HB (book I have heard about), FB (book I have forgotten), coupled with a rating of --, -, +, ++ to indicate a negative or positive opinion about them.</p>


<p>I am glad to have read this book for, ironically perhaps, a reason that I think is the major... if not missed, at least brushed over, point, which is that I think his view of books is very fiction-centric. What he is saying is not <em>wrong</em> for non-fiction, but I feel it is incomplete and elides much of the impact that a book can have on your thinking. His point is still valuable here - there are many ways to achieve that impact other than a thorough in-depth reading of the book, and some of them will even work <em>better</em> than a close reading the book (e.g. in-depth discussion interspersed with skimming and the occasional read) - but given that I think of this as one of the major point of books I would have appreciated more discussion.</p>


<p>On the other hand this is a bit of a "Why didn't you include...?" and if he had included everything that could be said on the the subject the book would have been significantly less pleasingly short, so perhaps it is best left as is.</p>


<p>Possibly interesting to contrast with "How to Read a Book".</p>

<p>I asked two related questions on Twitter recently. <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1051436665137496065">The first was about short non-fiction books</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Seeking recommendations of books with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Available in paperback form with &lt; 300 pages (ideally &lt; 200).</li>
<li>Non-fiction</li>
<li>Taught you something interesting</li>
<li>Accessible to a (reasonably well educated) general audience</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>


<p>At some point I realised that all of the books I had on my list for this and almost all of the recommendations were written by white men, so <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1051451758239723520">I asked a follow-up question</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Opening up the subquestion of this because it's made me go "wait a second...".</p>
<p>What are your favourite nonfiction books that are not written by white men? Bonus if they also meet the other criteria of the quoted tweet but not essential.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>There are a lot of good answers to both tweets that I will not attempt to summarise here.</p>


<p>I then decided that if I was buying this many books in one sitting I might as well not give Amazon my money for this and decided to go to <a href="https://www.foyles.co.uk/">Foyles</a>.
I ended up leaving with uh, quite a lot of books. Book stores are very good for serendipitous discovery and purchase in a way that websites are not, especially with Amazon's dreadful recommendations.</p>


<p>There is <em>some</em> overlap with both the recommendations and the stated goals, but it's far from total. I ended up buying 15 books. Of these one was written by a man, and another co-authored by one.
Of the women authors a couple were people of colour but I haven't checked that carefully which.</p>


<p>The Foyles haul was:</p>


<ul>
<li>How to understand your gender - Alex Iantaffi and Meg-John Barker (short nonfiction, written by a trans man and an enby)</li>
<li>The Remainder - Alia Trabucco Zerán (short but fiction, written by a hispanic woman)</li>
<li>Flights - Olga Tokarczuk (longish fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Give People Money - Annie Lowrey (short nonfiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Doughnut Economics - Kate Raworth (just squeezes under the short book criteria if you ignore appendices and references, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>The Good Immigrant (fits the short book criteria, written by a variety of authors, some women, some men, I think mostly people of colour)</li>
<li>Watching the English - Kate Fox (non-fiction but long, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Estates: An Intimate History - Lynsey Hanley (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Big Capital: Who is London for? - Anna Minton (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>Chronicles: On Our Troubled Times - Thomas Piketty (short non-fiction, written by a white man)</li>
<li>A Field Guide to Getting Lost - Rebecca Solnit (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>The Art of Cruelty - Maggie Nelson (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>The Lonely City - Olivia Laing (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>How to Suppress Women's Writing - Joanna Russ (short non-fiction, written by a white woman)</li>
<li>We Should All Be Feminists - Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie ((very!) short non-fiction, written by a black woman)</li>
</ul>


<p>There was no particular rhyme or reason to this selection. A bunch of these are books that were staff picks at Foyles, a few were ones from the recommendations I'd got. "How to understand your gender" has vaguely been on my to read list for a while. Mostly I just wandered around looking for things that caught my eye.</p>


<p>So once I've managed to plow through this pile (which due to reasons I have less than two months to do. Fun times) I should at least be a bit better in the gender balance of who I read nonfiction by! Race is still decidedly lacking though.</p>

<p>The general point being that getting people to try to solve the problem on their own as a starting point is not actually a good teaching model,

I find this counterintuitive personally, and I suspect they're framing it as a more certain thing than it really is, but I still think it's worth taking note of.</p>


<p>I wonder how this ties in with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xI42pfz5Ec">Sue Sentance's PyCon UK keynote</a> suggestion of teaching programming by giving people something to modify.
There I guess you are giving them a worked example first, so the two seem mutually supportive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pHhRt2q3K6KfFE5kd/nyoom">Nyoom</a> by Alicorn is a lovely piece about her new mobility scooter.
There's a refrain throughout that hit me particularly hard:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Not like, you know, really disabled.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I wasn't <em>disabled</em> or anything! </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Because I thought I wasn't disabled.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I hate this idea that "disabled" is a binary category that you either are or aren't. There's no magic threshold at which it's suddenly OK to need help. Everyone needs help, and if something helps you you should do it.</p>


<p>I don't think Alicorn disagrees with this, and I think this is probably a deliberate point of the piece, I just want to emphasise it.</p>


<p>The world is <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/06/on-not-quite-fitting/">full of threshold effects</a> where we take some continuous spectrum and declare that everything that is past this point counts and everything that's not doesn't. This is bullshit.</p>


<p>You see this a lot with psychological issues as well, and it ties in to the war on drugs. There are a lot of drugs that are currently prescription only that I suspect would be much more widely useful - ADHD or modafinil for example. Hell, <em>I'd</em> probably benefit from one or both of these - do I have ADHD? No, I am almost certainly not able to meet the clinical definition of ADHD, but I've had more than one person look at my output on the internet and go "So, David...", and I'm definitely at least halfway in that direction. Do I have a sleep disorder? Yes, almost certainly. Is it one of the two that you can get modafinil prescribed for? Nah.</p>


<p>We need to stop thinking of medication and assistive tech and, well, everything else, in terms of "Here is some discrete set of conditions that they fix" and more in terms of "this is the class of problems they help with".
If you have a problem and there is something that would help you with it, the solution should be available to you regardless of whether you cross the threshold of "really needing it".</p>

<p>My brain is currently trying to synthesise some stuff together that I'm not sure I can articulate in less than a Chidi-thesis worth of content and it's very annoying.</p>
<p>The following combine in a way that I have not yet been able to tease out a small t thesis from:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The Shock of the Old" - David Edgerton</li>
<li>"Shop Class as Soulcraft" - Matthew Crawford</li>
<li>"The Two Cultures of Mathematics" - Tim Gowers</li>
<li>"Telling is Listening" - Ursula Le Guin</li>
</ul>
<p>Roughly the area I am attempting to sound out is the idea of knowledge which is embodied in a person or a group, and cannot be separated from that without essentially rebuilding it from scratch (possibly with some gentle editing from a teacher who already understands it).</p>
<p>Physical skills are very much like this (you can't just read a book to learn a martial art), but I think we treat cognitive skills as if they're <em>not</em> like this, when they absolutely are, and we privilege knowledge based on how close it is to the ideal of transmissibility.</p>

<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Flat is better than nested.</li>

<li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
<li>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</li>
</ul>


<p>The only one of these people seem to remember is "explicit is better than implicit".
Unfortunately, it falls afoul of the problem that almost all "X is better than Y" advice has,
which is that the important qualification "All else being equal" is left, well, implicit.</p>


<p>Explicit is more verbose than implicit. Explicit is more expensive than implicit. If you try to make everything explicit then you will <em>never get anything done</em>,
because as with everything, being explicit has costs as well as benefits. Explicit may be better than implicit, but implicit is cheaper than explicit.
Everything is a trade-off.</p>


<p>It can be worth adjusting where you are in trade off space though - just because everything is a trade off doesn't mean you're automatically in the right region of trade off space,
and it's much easier to err in the direction of making things too explicit rather than too implicit.</p>


<p>Tying into past posts:</p>


<ul>
<li>One theme of the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-09-27-09:19.html">making difficult decisions discussion</a> is that making your decision making process explicit is often beneficial when you're struggling.</li>
<li>In <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-10-09-09:57.html">Try not to think about it</a> I argued that for many decisions it's actually better to make them implicitly rather than explicitly, by building the answer into your habits and environment, because if you make them explicitly then you open up the possibility of making them incorrectly.</li>

<p>I'm a huge fan of <a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">beeminder</a>.
I was on a break with it for a while, not for any very good reason, but I've been back using it for a couple of months now, and it's really good to be back.</p>


<p>A lot of the things I've been using beeminder for recently are a sort of... "making the fundamental feature of Beeminder contagious".
The fundamental feature of Beeminder for me is that you cannot simply decide to give up on a goal - because the goal will charge you if you don't satisfy it,
and because you have to wait a week for changes to take effect, the choice to stop a goal has to be a deliberate decision planned out in advance.</p>


<p>This is fairly huge to me.</p>


<p>A lot of goals I've had recently are basically of the form "keep doing the thing". This allows me to create systems with this property - beeminder doesn't track my <em>success</em> at using the system, it just tracks that I'm doing it at all.</p>


<p>Examples:</p>


<ul>
<li>Writing in my journal</li>
<li>Keeping up my book kanban</li>
<li>This notebook</li>
<li>Using the day plan system</li>
</ul>


<p>The notebook and day plan goals do have some quantity attached to them but it's not that important. The journal and book goals literally all they track is "Did I do the thing today?". If yes, I get a point. If no, I don't.
I can do as much or as little as I like as long as I do <em>something</em>. The <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-09-27-12:18.html">system itself is then what keeps me doing it well</a>, "all" beeminder is doing is keeping me participating in it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Auto-parallelising test-case reduction</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-11</dd>
</dl>


<p>There's a new parallel test-case reducer called <a href="https://github.com/googleprojectzero/halfempty">half-empty</a>.</p>


<p>It uses what is a new to me approach to parallelisation but is apparently also what C-Reduce does, which they call pessimistic parallelism.
The basic idea is that you parallelise based on the assumption that what you're going to try isn't actually going to work, you fork a background process to check if it does actually work,
and the main calculation just proceeds as if it was false. If your assumption that it rarely works mostly holds true, this lets you turn what seem like highly sequential processes into highly parallel ones.</p>


<p>It occurred to me that you could fairly easily automate this in a way that lets you write a test-case reducer exactly as if it were sequential but have it magically automatically parallelised in the background.</p>


<p>The way it would work is this: You have some test case reducer state object which has a cached version of the predicate. You wrap a reduction pass in some special function (say a decorator in Python).
Now when you call the predicate from within the reduction pass what happens is as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>If the result has already been cached, use that.</li>
<li>If the result <em>hasn't</em> been cached, return false and queue the result for background computation, which will update the cache when it is finished.</li>
<li>If at any point a backgrounded job returns true instead of false, clear the queue, wait for the current computations to finish, and then restart the reduction pass from the beginning.</li>
</ol>


<p>This makes a couple of assumptions:</p>


<ol>
<li>Running the full reduction pass is cheaper than running the predicate.</li>
<li>The predicate will rarely return true.</li>
</ol>


<p>Ways it might be useful to patch this:</p>


<ol>
<li>Keep the queue size bounded. When the test function calls the predicate and the queue is at capacity, have it block until the queue is emptier.</li>
<li>If the pessimistic assumption does not hold, e.g. say if at least 5 of the last 10 predicate calls were true, run the predicate in the foreground instead of backgrounding it.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you want a <em>really</em> cheeky approach (I don't think this will work), here's a neat trick you could try: Use some sort of classifier (language inference, machine learning, whatever) to predict the result of the predicate and use that,
invalidating when the parallel computation gets it wrong..
You could even just be very lazy and just predict whichever outcome is the most common.</p>


<p>Actually speaking of language learning, this approach would also work well for L* with a bit more tracking of dependencies, which would give you a fully parallel language learner. </p>

<p>A useful general principle is "If you have to make a decision to do something, you will eventually get it wrong".
As a result, it is often useful to arrange things to avoid decision making, even when this results in redundant work.
This is especially true when one class of error is much more costly than the other.</p>


<p>Some examples:</p>


<ol>
<li>Always lock the car when you walk away from it, even if you don't think you need it. Locking the car when you don't need to is cheap, forgetting to lock the car when you need to is very expensive.</li>
<li>Leave useful things (chargers, clothing, etc) in places where you are likely to need them (work, a partner's flat, etc, your family home), so that if you forget to bring one there is already a supply there. Having extra stuff is fairly cheap, but forgetting stuff you need is super annoying.</li>
<li>Keep small stuff in your bag that is regularly useful, even if you probably don't need it on any given trip (e.g. I always carry a phone charger and a pencil case). Same reasons as above (although the added weight isn't entirely cheap).</li>

<p>Attention conservation notice: This note is even more note to self than then normally are, so may not make much sense.</p>


<p>The following implementation strategy has just occurred to me, for writing code that can be both a randomized algorithm and a dynamic programming solution for giving you the full distribution (you can also achieve this by just writing it abstracted by a suitable monad implementation of course).</p>


<p>Add two primitives:</p>


<ol>
<li><code>branch(n)</code> conceptually generates a uniform random number \(0, \ldots, n - 1\).</li>
<li><code>consolidate(data)</code> says "the rest of the computation is uniquely determined by this value".</li>
</ol>


<p>In random generation, <code>branch</code> has the obvious implementation and <code>consolidate</code> does nothing.</p>


<p>When doing the dynamic programming, we use the standard trick for exhaustively enumerating a tree of unknown shape:
Explore based on prefixes, filling with infinitely many zeroes for branches drawn past the prefix, and increment it lexicographically until we can't any more.
The difference is that whenever we call <code>consolidate</code> with a value we have already seen, we raise an exception to terminate the process and add an entry that says to use the final value.
Conceptually this is the same as just exhaustively enumerating all the possibilities, but with shortcuts.</p>


<p>At the end we just solve the obvious dynamic programming problem to calculate the probabilities.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1047976938843885568">Twitter thread by me</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I wonder how many things we're all going around doing badly because the idea of not knowing how to do them well seems too ridiculous to admit to.
Prompted by the fact that I'm reading about Buteyko breathing (with a certain amount of skepticism). On the one hand "You're breathing badly" seems like a ridiculous claim. On the other... who ever taught you to breathe? Are you sure you haven't self-taught bad habits?
But also prompted by recent conversations about conversation. You've probably never been taught to have a conversation. I've had exactly one class on it and it was in the last six months. I know damn well that many people have not self-taught this well...
In general there's this entire class of implicit skills that we mostly don't think of as skills, that we're entirely self-taught on, and that we practice sufficiently non-demonstratively that we can't easily watch what other people do. The result is a very personal skill idiolect</p>
</blockquote>


<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiolect">Idiolect</a> is a very good word BTW. Not enough people know and use it.</p>


<p>To unpack on this slightly from conversation in that thread, there are two things going on here:</p>


<ul>
<li>There are things which don't even look like skills, so people don't know that being good or bad at them is a thing.</li>
<li>Even once you point out the possibility of treating these things as skills, the idea that you might be bad at them seems ridiculous.</li>
</ul>


<p>Other people have pushed back on the notion of "bad". In some cases it's just "could be better". I do think in many cases bad is the right word though. For example if it's really true that overbreathing can cause or aggravate asthma, I think that would count at being bad at breathing.</p>


<p>Another example is that apparently <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/02/26/587735283/lost-art-of-bending-over-how-other-cultures-spare-their-spines?t=1538691407256">westerners are apparently bad at bending over</a>.</p>


<p>Consider also the way this shows up in our use of language: Someone <em>has bad posture</em> rather than <em>being bad at posture</em>.</p>

<p>For the first five weekdays of every month, eat nothing but (non-potato) vegetables, cooked in fat if desired.  The rest of the time, eat whatever you want.</p>

<p>I've <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/07/notes-on-eating-more-vegetables/">previously written about trying to eat more vegetables</a>, where I'm trying to bring my meals up to at least half vegetables by volume.

<p class="subtitle">The Duties</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-03</dd>
</dl>


<p>I am generally deeply suspicious of normative ethical theories. I think ethics is hard, and attempts to simplify it to a set of rules inevitably have the problems that taking a complex space and making it legible always do.
They're potentially a useful mental tool, but as soon as you start arguing about which one is true you've lost. Even if I was a moral realist, which I'm not, it seems obviously the case that the ethics that can be told is not the true ethics.</p>


<p>So obviously I thought it might be an interesting experiment to set out to build one. The following is part of what I came up with.
This is something I at most weakly believe. I think it's a good model for evaluation of actions, but I don't think it's one I would actually attempt to follow dogmatically.</p>


<p>You have one duty: The world and all that is in it should thrive. Things should get better over time, not worse.</p>


<p>You have four duties: To yourself, to those around you, to humanity, and to the world.</p>


<p>Until you have fulfilled the earlier duties, you should not consider the later.</p>


<ol>
<li>Your duty to yourself is that you thrive.</li>
<li>Your duty to those around you is that you help them thrive.</li>
<li>Your duty to humanity is that your existence should help rather than hinder it in thriving.</li>
<li>Your duty to the world is that your existence should help rather than hinder it in thriving. </li>
</ol>


<p>Each duty supersedes the later ones: Ensure you thrive, then others around you, then humanity, then the world.
This does not mean that you should always prioritise yourself above others, but it does mean that you should put your oxygen mask on first before helping others with theirs.</p>


<p>To live a good life is to discharge your duties to the best of your ability.
There is no shame in failing to uphold these duties because you are unable, only because you are unwilling.</p>


<p>(I originally had a bunch of text explaining the reasoning behind this, but actually this is more intended as an interesting artifact than something I'd propose to defend, so I just deleted it).</p>

I'm as surprised as you are given the last two years of British politics.</p>


<p>The particular thing that <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1043075395237625858">was surprising to him</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What the everloving fuck? I love the idea of mapping political positions this way, but you reckon "everyone is a bit racist" and "i like theresa may" are... lawful good? How about lawful evil? I think well-meaning fussy philosophical types vote libdem, not ukip.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>My reply:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Paladins are literally cops, Jack.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So, uh, yeah. ALGCAP (All Lawful Good Characters Are Bastards).</p>


<p>I have technically played a lawful good paladin. My interpretation of him probably veered more chaotic good than was strictly accurate.</p>


<p>From <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1007533080750551040">an earlier discussion</a> with some other people:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I <em>have</em> played a paladin and it worked pretty well. He was very good at smiting people with sarcasm (and then a sword).
I think I just decided that traditional interpretations of lawful good as being humourless were too narrow and decided to have fun with the concept
After all, nothing incompatible about a deep burning righteous anger at the injustice of the world and a profound desire to fuck with people.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Shit, maybe I <em>am</em> the lawful good character.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(For the record, I am not the lawful good character. I'm very clearly Chaotic Good. Maybe Neutral Good on days when I'm too lazy to be properly chaotic).</p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1046703352522985472">Jack and I later discussed</a> another aspect of the villain versus hero dynamic:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Me: Every time I find myself going "hmm the villain actually has a pretty good point it's a shame they're evil" I start to head canon that I'm consuming media from the "plucky ragtag heroes'" well funded propaganda arm.</p>
<p>Jack: What I eventually realised was that villains' motivations ranged from "bizarre" to "excellent" but if what made them villains was doing unjustifiably bad things in the pursuit of that.</p>
<p>Me: I think that is broadly true, but that it is remarkably convenient how the people with excellent motivations for changing the system always do unjustifiably bad things in the pursuit of that.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>"Avatar: The Legend of Korra" is possibly the worst example of this I have ever seen: I broadly enjoyed the show, but <em>every single villain</em> was raising legitimate objections to the system, but fortunately they were evil so you could just punch them and move on without addressing the fundamental systemic inequalities that they were objecting to.</p>


<p>As I put it elsewhere in that thread:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Gotta love them underdogs and their defence of the status quo</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Recommended reading/viewing on this subject:</p>


<ul>
<li>Spiderlight by Adrain Tchaikovsky is an excellent deconstruction of D&amp;D alignment systems.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA">Twisted: The Untold Story of a Royal Vizier</a> is <em>so</em> good. I keep wanting to write a new version of Rules of Wishing based on a Twisted set of characters rather than the original movie's.</li>

<p class="subtitle">On Formal Mathematics</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-10-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>Some thoughts on the question of the formalisability of mathematics.</p>


<p>Based on "Rigor and Structure" by John P. Burgess <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1040505316201385986">I tweeted</a> the following a while back:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I'm reading "Rigor and Structure" by John P. Burgess at the moment, and a point he makes that I really like is that formal logic is best viewed as analogous to a sort of... physics or economics of mathematics. It is a (very good) theoretical model of Actual Mathematics.
And one way the model breaks down is that it's a great model of deducibility, but a poor model of deduction - you can be reasonably confident that if a proposition is formally deducible then it's real-maths deducible, and we also believe the converse mostly on faith but it doesn't follow (and mostly isn't true) that the actual process of proof is well modelled by the formal logic - e.g. proof lengths in informal and formal mathematics are not well correlated, and the styles of proof that you adopt are radically different.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Ron Pressler took exception to this framing, and I believe in particular to the part that we believe mostly on faith that every informal proof is formalisable.
I've tried several times to write what I believe Ron's argument against this is, but it kept coming out as such an implausible strawman that I must assume that I am misunderstanding some crucial aspect of his point.</p>


<p>Another informative text on the subject is Imre Lakatos's "Proofs and Refutations" which makes, I think, a compelling argument that understanding proof purely in terms of its formal content is a very limiting view.
Burgess is arguing around (though not entirely for) the idea that "a proof is that which convinces", but Lakatos is arguing that the primary purpose of a proof is not to convince but to illuminate (this is a huge oversimplification).</p>


<p>The problem I have with the idea that we should naturally expect all informal proofs to be formalisable is as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>It's obviously false. Informal proofs lead to formal proof <em>schemas</em> unless you pick your logic very carefully. In particular informal proofs can e.g. quantify over predicates.</li>
<li>The arguments I have seen that we should expect it to be true from the deeper Church-Turing principle seem so obviously wrong that I can't even interpret them as coherent: The ability to simulate a human brain well enough to replicate an informal proof on a Turing machine doesn't tell you anything about formal provability of a propostion, it provides a formal proof that an informal proof exists.</li>
<li>Many informal proofs most interesting characteristic is that they demonstrate a contradiction or paradox in the natural language that goes away when you attempt to formalise them. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox">the interesting number paradox</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berry_paradox">the Berry paradox</a>. This means that the formalisation process in itself has interesting semantic content.</li>
<li>It is typical for any informal proof to have so many logic gaps in it that finding a formal refinement of the proof really constitutes creating an entirely new proof. Therefore even if this is true, it is true in a fairly weak sense.</li>
</ol>


<p>Do I think that any sufficiently precise informal proof of a statement whose natural language meaning has an unambiguous formal equivalent can be refined to a formal proof schema?
Yes, almost certainly.</p>


<p>Do I think that the above is obviously true rather than a belief? No, and I don't think it would be possible for it to be obviously true - we don't have a sufficiently pinned down notion of what an informal proof even <em>is</em>.</p>


<p>Do I think this is all a pointless distraction from the actually interesting point made above, which is that formal proof is a much better model of provability than it is of proof? Yes, definitely.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1046341533992128512">Twitter thread from me</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The worst thing about all of these "diversity shouldn't get in the way of finding the best person!!" arguments (I know, it's a hard choice) is the complete and utter disconnect from reality required to believe that anyone has a clue about how to find the best person.
Santa Claus isn't real, and your interview/talk selection/whatever process is probably almost entirely noise rather than signal.
The good news about this is that it means you might as well decide on the outcome you want and then apply your process to select among the options within that outcome.</p>
<p>The bad news is I'm going to assume that you've done that, so the outcome you got is the outcome you wanted.
These are legitimately hard problems, and I have more sympathy than most for the trade offs involved in them, so I'm not e.g. going to assume you're a terrible person because of a failure to hire diverse candidates, but I am going to assume you probably weren't trying very hard.
Source: I've fucked up this way, and in retrospect I wasn't trying very hard.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The two books I recommend to people interviewing are <a href="https://amzn.to/2P0g8Qr">The Halo Effect</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2ReeP1J">Epistemology and the Psychology of Human Judgment</a>.
Neither will, unfortunately, teach you to interview well. I don't know of anything that will. If you have book recommendations on this subject then I would like to hear them.
Instead what these books will teach you is to doubt your own judgement when interviewing, which I think is a pretty good start - the worst interview processes I've been involved in have failed due to people trusting their own judgement over the process.</p>


<p>Things I would like people to understand about interviewing:</p>


<ol>
<li>Your process has false positive and false negative rates. You mostly can't see the false negative rate, so it's probably very high.</li>
<li>Without a better idea of what you're actually looking for, your false positive rate is basically meaningless anyway.</li>
<li>You are not actually looking for the best person for the job. You are looking for a person who can do the job well. Trying to find the best person for the job would <em>extremely</em> expensive in interviewing time.</li>
<li>The job will change people, so even among a small candidate pool the person who is currently the best fit for the job may not be the same as the person who is the best fit in three months anyway.</li>
<li>The "person who is best at the job" according to most easy to track measures may be very different from the person who brings the most to the team.</li>
</ol>


<p>Given this, my advice to you is <em>not</em> throw out your whole interview process. Not because I think your current interview process is good, but because throwing it out and replacing it with something else will cost a lot of political capital and you probably still won't create a good interview process because interviewing is bloody impossible.</p>


<p>Instead my advice to you is this:</p>


<ol>
<li>Keep an eye on your false negative rate. Maybe let a random or biased set of candidates through the early stage of your pipeline who you would otherwise have ignored.</li>
<li>Do pay attention to stuff like what your job ads look like. I don't currently have a good link for advice on this but if someone sends me one I'll edit it in.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.doismellburning.co.uk/how-not-to-screw-up-hiring/">Read Kristian's Blog Post</a></li>
<li>Think in advance about what you actually want and what you would settle for.</li>
<li>Try to make sure you're getting a broader and more diverse audience in to your process in the first place. Watch out for filtering that happens before they reach you - e.g. based on recruiters, job platforms, etc.</li>

<p class="subtitle">Principles of (Social) System Design</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-27</dd>

<p>I think the following two points are under-appreciated when designing systems for people:</p>


<ul>
<li>Everything works well in high trust environments where people are personally invested in the goal of the system.</li>
<li>Nothing works well in low trust environments or where people are opposed or indifferent to the goal of the system.</li>
</ul>


<p>Therefore when designing systems the most important questions are:</p>


<ol>
<li>How can we eject bad actors?</li>
<li>How can we retain trust in the system?</li>
<li>How can the system help people to achieve the things that they already want to do?</li>
</ol>


<p>I have found this to be very true when designing systems for myself (skipping the first step - I may be a bad actor, but I can't eject myself). I don't have enough practical experience at group system design to say for sure it applies there,
but just based on what I've observed of other systems' failure modes I'm pretty confident that it does.</p>

</dl>


<p>I attended the London <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a> meetup the other day. I really enjoyed it.
We did a <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/17-conversation-cafe/">conversation cafe</a> which was an interesting format that I'm definitely going to borrow some ideas from.</p>


<p>The subject of our cafe was "Making Difficult Decisions". I found this really useful and have been wanting to write up my thoughts on our discussion in a proper article,
but haven't been finding the time or spoons, so here are my notes on the topic so that I can remember what I wanted to say when I actually get around to that.</p>


<p>Note: Various of these points were made by various people. I'm going to make them without attribution, partly because the conversation was quite personal, and partly because I haven't recorded the attribution!
I just want to make it clear that although I agree with all of this, it is not at all original to me. I've tried to make this a fair representation of what people said, but it's inevitably filtered and biased by my views on it and what I found interesting. Where my thoughts are things from writing this post rather than from the conversation itself, I have tried to mark them clearly by prefacing them with "Aside:".</p>


<p>A theme we hit on early is that it's rarely the decision that is difficult. Once you have got to the point where you understand that there is a decision to be made, we haven't actually found that it's very hard to make it,
and once we've made it we feel an incredible sense of relief.
The difficulty is getting to the point where we have anything as concrete and simple as a single decision.</p>


<p>Examples (these are all super paraphrased, I don't have the actual quotes written down):</p>


<ul>
<li>"It's easy for me to decide what I want to do at any given moment, but I have no idea how to deal with big picture questions like what to do with my life."</li>
<li>"I stayed in a job for seven years that I probably should have stayed in for two." (there were several of these)</li>
<li>"I had to admit that a project that I was personally very deeply invested in wasn't working and leave it."</li>
<li>"I had been in a miserable relationship for some time and despite my best efforts to make it work, it wasn't."</li>
<li>"I had just moved to start a new job and had to admit to myself that it wasn't working out." (there were several of these, one of which was me)</li>
</ul>


<p>In many of these cases, we reported that once we had identified and made the decision we felt <em>great</em>.</p>


<p>A key point that we identified in this "making decisions is easy" aspect is resilience - the ability to feel safe making these decisions. We knew that regardless of which we decided, nothing <em>too</em> bad was going to happen to us.
We mostly talked about emotional resilience.</p>


<p>Aside: Financial resilience is also important, but we had a group of people from (I assume) fairly high-paying jobs by nature of the meetup, so this didn't end up really factoring in to the discussion.</p>


<p>Another thing that came up was the observation that often there was some sort of crystalising event that prompted the decision. e.g. being asked "Are you happy?", or some particularly bad event at work that forced them to realise that it was time to think about leaving.</p>


<p>Aside: I have two personal examples related to this that I didn't bring up. The first is that when I left Google it was prompted by reading the GCL ("<del>Google</del>General Configuration Language") specification from cover to cover and going "fuck this shit". I didn't quit over GCL, but GCL was what prompted me to realise that I should. If you want an idea of what GCL is like, I refer you to <a href="http://flabbergast.org/">flabbergast</a> which is basically an open source implementation of it. The second is that I was recently asked "If you weren't working on this, what <em>would</em> you be working on?" RE Hypothesis, which was a very useful clarifying question for a number of reasons that alas this margin is too large to contain.</p>


<p>Some good points that were made in the course of the discussion:</p>


<ul>
<li>We like to pretend we make decisions logically, but often they are based on emotion and the logic just exists to post-rationalise the decision.</li>
<li>Often the hardest decisions are about leaving a situation where we have a great deal of our identity or relationships bound up in it.</li>
<li>The relationships that tie us in to a place are often actually improved by leaving it - if we're miserable there then we might not be much fun to be around!</li>
<li>Often when you're staying for other people, they're staying for you, and everyone would be happier if they just all up and left.</li>
</ul>


<p>Someone made the point that we were very focused on "making decisions in hard situations" and asked whether there were easy situations that had hard decisions.
The joking example was that "chocolate or ice cream" is never a hard decision.</p>


<p>Aside: This is an instance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass">Buridan's Ass</a> problem. It's tempting to treat making a decision between very similar things as hard, when in fact it should be easy - just flip a coin because it doesn't matter very much.</p>


<p>One example we identified as a difficult decision that crops up without an accompanying difficult situation was "Should I flake on this event or not?" - not going feels like letting people down, even if you really don't have the energy or health to go.</p>


<p>Aside: Part of why this is a difficult decision is because even though (in most cases) the individual decision doesn't matter, the aggregate effect of it does. I have flaked on two events in a row with a friend recently, both for good reasons (one iron-clad, one merely good), but this feels much worse than twice as bad as flaking on one event, because it shows a pattern of flakiness. See also <a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2018/8/16/17694356/how-to-make-friends-adulthood">this vox article on losing friends</a>.</p>


<p>Some questions we finished with:</p>


<ul>
<li>How do we notice the decisions that we are not making?</li>
<li>How would one practice the skill of hard decisions?</li>
<li>How can one cultivate emotional resilience?</li>
<li>How can one create an environment that enables others around you to make hard decisions?</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1044619483086770176">I made a comment in conversation on Twitter the other day</a> that I like and need to think about more:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"A logically omniscient instance of homo economicus" is mostly just a good user persona to have in mind in your system design meetings</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Despite being generally down on SEU, both as a normative and as a descriptive model, I think think this might actually be a good use case of it:
Treat your system design <em>as if it contains such people</em> and ask what they will do will tell you useful things, as long as you don't pretend they are the only people using the system.</p>


<p>It's not dissimilar to the principle of design on the assumption that an abusive ex will be using the system: Abusive exes are not your main users (hopefully!) but knowing how they will abuse the system tells you important things about what you need to do.</p>


<p>One reason that this is an important user persona to consider is that people will tend to approximate it increasingly well as they get used to the system, and increasingly well as the amount of time and money they have available to bring to bear on it, so you can think of homo economicus as the user persona for people who are willing to sit down and figure out how to actively game your system.</p>


<p>A useful feature of both of these personas is that there's a continuum between normal users and them. Someone doesn't have to be an abusive ex to behave like an asshole to another user, and the tools for dealing with an abusive ex help there too. Similarly, if the system pushes homo economicus to awful destructive behaviour that you want to avoid, it will probably nudge normal users in that direction too.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Group Decisions on Names</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-26</dd>
</dl>


<p>Here's a question I'm currently wondering about: How would you design a group decision making procedure for naming things?</p>


<p>For <a href="https://twitter.com/sinister_katze">Sinister</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dexter_katze">Dexter</a> we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_judgment">Majority Judgment</a>.
We brainstormed pairs of names until we ran out, then we cast a vote on them.</p>


<p>The voting went as follows:</p>


<ul>
<li>Sinister and Dexter: 4, 4, 5</li>
<li>Gin and Tonic: 5, 1, 2</li>
<li>Lorem and Ipsum: 4, 3, 5</li>
<li>Gipfeli and Bretzeli: 2, 3, 4</li>
<li>Kappa and Lambda: 5, 3, 3</li>
<li>Jam and Chutney: 3, 1, 1</li>
<li>Terror and Erebus: 2, 5, 3</li>
</ul>


<p>So how this played out was that in the first round "Sinister and Dexter" and "Lorem and Ipsum" both scored 4, and everything else scored less, so those were the two candidates that made it through to the second round.
We then removed a 4 from each of their scores, and now "Sinister and Dexter" still scored 4 while "Lorem and Ipsum" scored 3, so the cats were named Sinister and Dexter.</p>


<p>Was this a good system? No, not really. I'm happy with the result, but the fact that you got a good outcome doesn't mean you had a good system.</p>


<p>There are a couple of problems with this. Firstly, the voting system. I don't have a problem with majority judgment (range voters don't @ me), but I think for this kind of very small group decision making any voting system has a legitimacy problem.
For example, imagine we had an option where the votes were 5, 5, 1. This would win, because its initial score was 5, despite one of us hating the name.</p>


<p>The bigger problem with this though is that it treats naming as a closed list decision procedure: We decide on the names up front, then we vote on it, and use the outcome of that vote. This is nonsense. Naming is intrinsically open ended - generating new candidates is cheap.</p>


<p><em>For example</em> the following might have been a better procedure:</p>


<ol>
<li>Everyone sits silently and writes down as many names as they like.</li>
<li>People read out the names they've chosen and, if they like, explain their reasoning and origin. Anyone has the opportunity to veto a name. Vetos are encouraged - the goal is to only leave names in the list where everyone is <em>happy</em> to use the name, even if it's not their favourite.</li>
<li>We vote on the names as above using majority judgement.</li>
<li>This gives us a candidate name.</li>
</ol>


<p>If we have an existing candidate name, we now take a majority vote whether to replace it with the new one. We then take a vote as to whether to continue the process or use the current candidate name. If we continue, repeat as above, possibly after some break.</p>


<p>Note that I don't think this is a particularly good system, it's just a sketch - the point is to incorporate the deliberative process of naming things into the mechanism, and to treat voting as a guideline rather than a source of legitimacy.</p>

<p>A thing I've been noticing a lot recently in how I think about problems is what an essential role switching between different models of the system has.</p>


<p>For example, when thinking about groups of people, it's important to think about the systems - what incentives are at play, how does the group response to events, etc.
You treat the group as an abstracted object that is not made up of complex individuals but instead has a few very simple variables in play.</p>


<p>It's <em>also</em> important, both ethically and practically, to think about the group as a collection of individual people. People are complex and will surprise you, and if you neglect their individual needs then you will usually treat people badly.</p>


<p>It might be tempting to think that the ideal is a single unified view of the system which accounts for everything, but realistically that's almost always impossible, and switching between multiple very distinct models can often work nearly as well.</p>


<p>One thing this does is it combats the problem of legibility - the thing where the easiest way to understand something simply is to make it simple enough to understand, destroying much of its essential complexity and causing massive damage - but this seems to be true even without that. e.g. in mathematics it is often useful to switch between different representations because they make different features more salient.</p>

<p>I just read Richard Gabriel's <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/Files/Incommensurability.pdf">The Structure of a Programming Language Revolution</a>.</p>


<p>I don't think I have enough grounding in either lisp or the philosophy of science to fully understand it, and want to do a second and closer read with citation chasing,
but one point really stood out for me:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I believe that, in general, this view of engineering and science is false: I believe engineering and science are intertwined, and for programming languages and software creation techniques, it’s often the case that engineering precedes science—and it’s very easy to see it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>...</p>


<blockquote>
<p>One good example is the steam engine. Engineers began its development while scientists were making their way from the phlogiston theory of combustion to the caloric theory of heat, both today considered hilarious. </p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this observation is <em>obviously true</em>, and I'm kicking myself for the fact that I didn't think it was obviously true until it was pointed out to me.</p>


<p>This is also interesting in the context of the way pure and applied maths work. Often physicists are doing interesting mathematical things that are "completely wrong" until a pure mathematician comes along and provides a theory of how they could work.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Some of my favourite PyCon UK talks</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-21</dd>
</dl>


<p>The PyCon UK team are amazingly fast at uploading their videos,
which means <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChA9XP_feY1-1oSy2L7acog">the entire conference is now online on youtube</a> (There was some problem with one video but I'm not sure whether that's been resolved, so maybe the entire conference bar one talk).</p>


<p>If I'm being honest, I don't go to PyCon UK for the talks - I go because it's an amazing community. In general I don't get a huge amount out of talks in most conferences I go to.
However I thought there were some especially high quality talks this year,
including some that I not just watched but am going to <em>rewatch</em>.</p>


<p>So, here are some of my favourite talks that I would actively recommend.</p>


<p>The two talks that were so good that I intend to rewatch them (mostly to mine for citations and talking points) are:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/2xI42pfz5Ec">Sue Sentance - Teaching programming: What's in a teacher's toolkit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQo8C_ZHOM8&amp;t=5s">Hannah Hazi - The Knowledge in the Code</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Sue Sentance's keynote basically made me go "Welp, I need to redesign all my workshops". Hannah's talk had a lot of interesting material on reading code, and I want to follow the references to read more about it - I don't currently need most of the specific advice on legacy code, but reading code is still a very useful skill, especially given Sue's emphasis on its importance for education!</p>


<p>Daniele also gave an impromptu talk about documentation that is going to significantly impact how I write documentation in future.
It was not recorded, but I believe it was a variation on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vKPhjcMZg">this talk at PyCon Australia</a> (or possibly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azf6yzuJt54">this one at PyCon US</a>).</p>


<p>Talks I would recommend but was already too much of a member of the choir to get that much out of (all of these are by people I'd consider friends or at least friendly acquaintances. This probably isn't coincidental but wasn't deliberate in my selection except in the sense that I always go to friends' talks if they don't clash with anything else that grabs me):</p>


<ul>
<li>Alex Chan's talks on trust and user safety. His keynote was on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3XxPnbehqQ">Building Trust</a>, and he followed up with another talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyGVRlRyT-E">Assume Worst Intent</a>. Alex and I have already talked about some of these issues before, and have broadly similar opinions on them, so I didn't personally get a huge amount out of them, but they're good material and Alex gave great talks on them.</li>
<li>Nikoleta Glynatsi's keynote, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8tL7iqGvnw">Why does a smile make a difference?</a> was a lot of fun. She discussed her research on game theory, and why bats are awesome.</li>
<li>Kristian Glass on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtJ4p27e1r8">How to screw up hiring</a></li>
<li>Sean Sabbage on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U07aAQciHx0">Coming to a shared understanding</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Misc talks I enjoyed and got something out of but that don't have any particularly insightful categorisation of</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-6n-WGMOU8">The Story of a 53 year old database</a> - I don't think I got anything out of this in the sense of things I will now do differently, but I enjoyed hearing this story. Pairs well with Hannah Hazi's talk.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvRSDV4edY8">Coding as a Second Career</a> was a fairly personal story but one I think it is helpful to hear.</li>
</ul>


<p>I also thought the lightning talks this year were excellent:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hp-1plTKOqc">Saturday lightning talks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w_qgGZM4ao">Sunday lightning talks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j2AhPmjtOQ">Monday lightning talks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5jSUJVymXk">Tuesday lightning talks</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you have a burning urge to see me speak (which I'm mostly not doing this year), I gave <a href="https://youtu.be/9j2AhPmjtOQ?t=133">a talk about voting system</a>. I'm mostly pretty happy with how this turned out.</p>

<p>Well, <a href="https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/">PyCon UK</a>, the best conference, is over for another year. Sad face.</p>


<p>This year I ended up doing something with a surprising amount of impact on my and others' experience of the conference:
I tweeted a <em>lot</em>. Yes, I know, even by my standards. I essentially became the unofficial scribe of the conference.
I won't even attempt to embed them, but <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23PyConUK%20from%3ADRMacIver%20since%3A2018-09-13%20until%3A2018-09-20&amp;src=typd">here's a search query that will give you everything I tweeted on the conference hash tag for this conference</a>.</p>


<p>Each day:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1040497560652271616">Yay! It's time for the annual week of visiting Brodie's to begin. Oh and #PyConUK is on too.</a></li>

</ul>


<p>Why? Well, <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1040497560652271616">I'd been talking recently about how conference organisers put up with a lot</a> and a point that got made in response to this is that a really helpful thing for attendees to do is tweet about the conference - it helps get more sponsors next year, promotes the ideas of the conference, and generally raises its profile.
This seemed an easy enough thing to do, so I decided to give it a try and got a little bit carried away.</p>


<p>People seemed to <em>really</em> like me doing this. Especially the organisers - I heard from a lot of them that the running commentary helped them feel more in touch with the conference. So if this achieved nothing else then I'm happy with it.
It also was appreciated by people who weren't able to make the conference, and in a few cases to those who would never have come because they weren't even programmers (though I of course still think they should come)!</p>


<p>People have asked me how I did it, but it's not really complicated: I had a laptop, I touchtype really fast, and I've wasted far too much of my life on Twitter. I had not previously thought the latter was a professional skill, but apparently.</p>


<p>I did have a couple of problems with doing it:</p>


<ul>
<li>Twitter threading is awful. I'm not sure how much it helped people. I think I will probably not bother threading this the next time I do it, and I screwed up the threading in a bunch of places.</li>
<li>Quoting people in real time is basically impossible. I am not a STTR. I ended up paraphrasing a lot and I'm not sure I was clear enough about that.</li>
<li>I tried to distinguish where I was reporting what the speaker was saying versus when I was commenting. I did not always remember to do this.</li>
<li>I would like other people to do this too next year. I'm concerned that this gave people a very DRMacIver-flavoured view of the conference. This is especially relevant because I think for a variety of reasons (mostly that I rarely go to technical talks) I missed out on a lot of first-time speakers.</li>
</ul>


<p>On the whole though, this level of live-tweeting seems to have been popular, and I will probably do it again at future conferences I attend.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Lean Coffee at PyCon UK</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-20</dd>
</dl>


<p>As part of the PyCon UK sprints I ran a variant lean coffee. It worked really well - we had a bit of an initial slow start, peaked at more people than the group could really handle,
and gradually tapered down to a group of four by the end of the day. This was split over three sessions, during which we discussed 23 different cards.</p>


<p>The variant we ran was based on <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/05/randomizing-lean-coffee/">a previous proposal of mine to randomize lean coffee</a>. Several people had reported that they ran lean coffees this was after my post, and thought that it worked much better, but I'd never actually got around to trying it, and I thought this was a good opportunity.</p>


<p>In my entirely unbiased opinion, I can confirm that it works much better.
People seemed to really enjoy the format, and many of them reported that they would take it away and try to run it at work.
For the third session I was basically wiped out (scribing, moderating, <em>and</em> discussing at the same time was something I could <em>do</em>, but it was very high energy),
so I passed on the duties - one person took up moderating, another took up scribing, and there were no problems with doing so, so the system seems to be easy enough to transmit to other people, which is a win.</p>


<h3>The Conversation</h3>


<p>The point of the system is to provide a structured conversation about a large range of topics in a very short space of time.
We select a card (more on that below). This has a discussion prompt (often a question) and the name of the person who proposed it.
At this point anyone may veto discussing the card. People shouldn't veto cards just because they're uninterested, the veto system exists for topics that would make you unhappy or uncomfortable to have discussed.
This never actually came up in practice. I don't know if that is because people didn't feel empowered to veto or because it was never necessary - I <em>think</em> it is the latter,
but I don't feel like people would have necessarily been willing to veto if they needed to.</p>


<p>The proposer gets a (short!) opportunity to elaborate on the theme, then the group votes on whether they want to discuss it.
If a strict majority raise their hands, a 5 minute clock is started, and the group discusses it until the time runs out.
At that point, the group votes whether they want to continue it. If a strict majority does, a new 5 minute timer is started,
and the discussion continues.
The subject may not be extended a second time.</p>


<h3>Selecting the Cards</h3>


<p>At the beginning everyone writes down as many cards as they like and these are put in a central pile.
These are shuffled, and cards are selected by drawing from the top of the pile.
Anyone can insert a new card at any time they like, at which point the deck is reshuffled.</p>


<p>We adopted a system that I like in principle and think worked reasonably well but maybe ended up a bit too complicated - in order to ensure everyone got a good opportunity to seed the conversation,
we deprioritised cards from people who had recently had their topic discussed.</p>


<p>The way this worked was that when a card had been discussed we put it face up on the table.
If a card came up from someone whose name was already on the table, we put it aside. Once we had been through the whole deck,
we stacked the cards that were face up so that they were no longer visible,
shuffled the cards that had been put aside, and started the process again.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>I found it very easy to get cards confused, so I started marking cards that we had completed with a cross or a tick on the back so that we didn't mix them up.</li>
<li>One person ended up dominating the conversation a bit (he acknowledged this and welcomed the feedback). We adopted a convention that I would just start waving at him when I thought he'd been talking too long. I actually think we should have adopted this as a universal convention right at the beginning, with everyone feeling empowered to do it - there were almost certainly one or two times when someone should have been waving at <em>me</em>. Honestly I want to adopt this convention for all conversations, lean coffee or not, because I definitely have some friends who it would be useful for (in a constructive way! I think all of the people I have in mind would love this convention).</li>
<li>I tended to interrupt people mid-sentence when the time came up, but I should probably have started waving at them and then cut them off if they didn't wrap up within a sentence or two.</li>
<li>A nice thing about this format was that it was really easy for people to drop in and out. This created the question of what we should do when a card whose author has left comes up. We initially said we should just discard them, but then decided to vote on them anyway, but we never actually voted in favour of discussion, so I think we were probably right the first time.</li>
<li>I did note-taking in a Google doc for most of it, passing over to one of the other attendees for the third session until he left, at which point I took over again. It was <em>much</em> easier taking notes when I wasn't also moderating, and I would rather omit the note taking activity altogether than try to combine it with moderation duties in future (Note: Be careful when asking for volunteers to be note-taker. This is one of those things that instantly gets gendered, and a woman will probably end up doing it by default if you ask for volunteers, so it's best to either assign the role or do it by lot or something. That being said our volunteer note-taker in the third round was a man. On the third tentacle, PyCon UK attendees are lovely and are probably less prone to this failure mode).</li>
<li>We wrote down everyone's email addresses on a card and I'm going to email the notes around to give people an opportunity to sanitize (I already carefully omitted a few things that I didn't think should be public) and then I'll publish the notes publicly.</li>
<li>We didn't clarify the meaning of the voting system until quite late, but an important distinction is that you should raise your hand if you <em>want</em> to discuss the topic, not just if you're <em>happy</em> to discuss the topic.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Things that didn't quite work</h3>


<ul>
<li>I wasn't a fan of the show of hands system. I would like simultaneous, and maybe anonymous, voting - there was a lot of social pressure to conform I think, with people looking at other people before deciding what to vote. I would also like it to be easier to count, as it turns out that I am bad at counting majority voting in a group that is constantly changing and includes me.</li>
<li>I thought people were too nice early on - we had a lot of unanimous votes in favour of discussion. Some of these were legitimately high quality topics, but I feel like the unanimity was implausible for some of them. I'm going to think about mechanisms for offsetting this, but I think simultaneous voting might be enough.</li>
<li>There is definitely a size limit on how large the group can get before this gets a bit unwieldy. Four people was viable but maybe a bit too small. Once we were past ten it was definitely too large. The sweet spot is probably somewhere in the five to eight range.</li>
<li>I'd like a way to encourage some of the more quiet members of the group to speak as well as to encourage the louder members not to - there were some people in the group (mostly women) who I was pretty sure had interesting things to say but didn't feel able to (possibly due to being unable to get a word in edgewise). They may also just have been enjoying listening, I don't know - I know some people explicitly came just to listen in. Unfortunately they had to leave midway through, so I wasn't able to ask them. I'll do so when I email them.</li>
<li>We had a veto system - anyone was allowed to veto a card if they didn't want it discussed. This was introduced halfway through when</li>
</ul>


<h3>In Future</h3>


<p>A lot of people came away from this going "This was great, I need to run some of these". Including me! Despite the fact that several people have used my variations on lean coffee before, this is actually the first time <em>I</em> have. I'd already been thinking I'd like to run one of these at Imperial, and now I'm even more sure I would like to do that.</p>


<p>We also talked about maybe running some of these earlier in PyCon UK next year. They were a great generator of high insight conversations, and I think provided some really nice social connections with people that it would have been great to form more than six hours before we had to say "Well, see you in a year I guess!".</p>


<p>In general, a lot of the things we talked about involved things that might be nice for the conference next year (not criticisms! Almost all of the form "PyCon UK is great, but here's an idea that might make it <em>even greater</em>). I'm probably going to (finally) get involved in the organisation of PyCon UK next year and once people have decompressed a bit and are ready to receive feedback,
I'm going to write a summary of what those were and circulate it.</p>

<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-13</dd>
</dl>


<p>This is a fairly involved example which I don't expect to convince anyone,
and is just the result of me thinking through some things.</p>


<p>Suppose we have a bunch of propositions \(A_1, \ldots, A_n\).
We know a priori that \(A_i \implies A_j\) is false for \(i &gt; j\),
but do not know whether there are any forwards implications.
We have an "implication oracle" which acts as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>It has access to a number of "primitive implications" of the form \(A_i \implies A_j\).
   These implications are considered to be unreliable: They are true with probability \(1 - \epsilon\),
   but with probability \(\epsilon\) they provide no information (i.e. the proposition may be true, we just don't know that).
   These errors are independent.</li>
<li>We may query the proof oracle with any pair \(A_i, A_j\) and it tells us the probability of there being a valid proof of \(A_i \implies A_j\) given only a true set of primitive implications.</li>
</ol>


<p>We also have a "plausibility oracle" that gives us our prior probabilities of \(p_i = A_i\) being true.</p>


<p>Suppose we want to define an agent that chooses between these propositions, with a reward if the proposition chosen is true.</p>


<p>We can define a Bayesian agent that picks whichever of \(k \in \{i, j\}\) has the highest posterior probability\((1 - \epsilon) P(A_k | A_i \implies A_j) + \epsilon p_i\).</p>


<p>The problem with this agent is that it is not transitive!</p>


<p>Consider the following example: Let \(\epsilon = 0.11\),
and suppose we have the primitive implications \(A_1 \implies A_2\), \(A_2 \implies A_3\) and the prior probabilities \(p_1 = 0.2\), \(p_2 = p_3 = 0.01\).</p>


<p>Some boring computation that I can't be bothered to carry over to text results in the above agent preferring \(A_2\) to \(A_1\), \(A_3\) to \(A_2\) and \(A_1\) to \(A_3\).
The reason is that the strength of the implication \(A_1 \implies A_3\) is weaker than that of either the individual implications, as it is \(1 - (1 - \epsilon)^2 \approx 0.21\).
Thus even though we still "believe" this implication, the weaker strength of it makes our prior probabilities overwhelm it.</p>


<p>Now, this paradox goes away if we have access to the inner workings of the implication oracle:
If we know all of the primitive implications a priori then we can just calculate the "true" posterior probabilities across all possible combinations of whether the implications are valid or not,
and pick the answer with the highest posterior,
but this effectively requires us to know the entire space of propositions in advance.</p>


<p>I think that <em>no</em> strategy which has to decide based only on the answer of those two oracles on the current pair can dominate this strategy,
because this is the dominant strategy for the case where there are only two propositions and the oracles are exactly correct about the probabilities,
but I haven't checked the details of this argument.</p>


<p>So what this means in practice is that if some elements of your reasoning are "screened off" from you as black boxes,
and you do not have full knowledge in advance of the set of available options,
even a fully VNM-rational Bayesian reasoner will necessarily exhibit intransitive preferences.</p>


<p>However! Note that <em>this does not mean that they can be Dutch Booked</em>.
The reason for this is that the proper Bayesian reasoner will update their posteriors about propositions as they are forced to make choices.
This may in fact mean that the time varying preferences they make are actually transitive, at least in the limit, while their instantaneous preferences are not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The distinctive definition-theorem-proof format of professional publications is the single most conspicuous feature of mathematical practice.</p>
<p>The quality whose presence in a purported proof makes it a genuine proof by present-day journal standards, and whose absence makes the proof spurious in a way that if discovered will call for retraction, is called rigor.</p>
<p>The assessment of purported proofs for rigor is generally not the topic of a separate course.</p>
<p>Mathematicians’ views on the nature of rigor and proof may more often be expressed in aphorisms and epigrams, in anecdotes and jokes, for instance, of the common ‘an engineer, a physicist, and a mathematician…’ genre, than in formal theoretical pronouncements.</p>
<p>contrary to the dictum that a proof is what convinces, not everything that convinces is a proof</p>
<p>such methods, and other aspects of early modern mathematics, also exemplify what I will call reliance on generic reasoning. By this I mean performing calculations or manipulations that usually or generally work but sometimes or exceptionally fail, treating as universally applicable techniques that are — and may be known to be — only applicable in favorable cases, in the hope and belief that the case in which one is interested is one of the favorable ones, but without any rigorous justification for supposing this to be so.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>On uniform continuity:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The distinction is a matter of the order of quantifiers (all-all-exists vs all-exists-all, or in logicians’ notation \(\forall\forall\exists\) and \(\forall\exists\forall\) cannot be made unless the quantifiers have been made explicit and not left implicit in expressions like ‘close as desired’ or ‘close enough’.</p>
<p>Proofs depending on calculations, in particular, are especially likely to go wrong if the calculations are long and complicated enough.</p>
<p>Rigorism imposes no restriction on definitions other than rigor, and leaves one perfectly free to explore definitions that may at first seem complicated and unnatural, if there are grounds for hoping they will be useful and fruitful.</p>
<p>Owing to the freedom to introduce useful new notions regardless of simplicity or naturalness, so long only as they are rigorously defined, nothing need be lost.</p>
<p>Time and again during the early twentieth century non-rigorous but useful methods introduced by physicists or engineers were found to have rigorous counterparts, the development of which at the very least clarified the scope and limits of the techniques, and more often than not had other side benefits as well.</p>
<p>Brouwer’s mysticism led him to believe that mathematics is largely an incommunicable mental activity, not to say an ineffable meditative practice, and as a result the rules of intuitionist game were never clearly articulated</p>
<p>Deduction and Deducibility. Here one must confront the fact that if one looks to logic textbooks, though one will find an agreed characterization of logical consequence, which I have already discussed, one finds no agreed characterization of logical deduction.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The point being that logic has more to say about the process that determines what the true statements are than how to actually determine the true statements. This is analagous to the enumeration vs predicate view of a set.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[Mathematical logic] resembles mathematical physics and mathematical economics in that its models are highly idealized. In particular, as I have been emphasizing, it gives a quite good model of mathematical deducibility, but a much poorer model of mathematical deduction.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The point being that formal logic is a kind of "spherical cow in a vacuum" version of actual logic performed by real mathematicians.</p>

<p class="subtitle">What might a continuous rational agent look like?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-10</dd>
</dl>


<p>In a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-09-09-21:02.html">previous post</a> I said I didn't care much about this problem,
which obviously nerd-sniped me into thinking about it.</p>


<p>So, the question is: We have a "rational" agent which is making choices over pairs of lotteries \(\mathcal{L}\),
and it does this in terms of a function \(\tau : \mathcal{L}^2 \to [0, 1]\) where \(\tau(u, v)\) means "the probability of choosing \(u\) in preference to \(v\).</p>


<p>We had the nice (ish) VNM theory for physically impossible discontinuous rational agents,
but what should the axioms for a continuous rational agent look like?</p>


<p>The following seem like they should obviously hold:</p>


<ol>
<li>\(\tau(L, M) = 1 - \tau(M, L)\).</li>
<li>If we define \(L \prec M\) as meaning \(\tau(L, M) = 1\) then \(\preceq\) should be a partial order.</li>
<li>If we define \(L \tilde M\) as meaning \(\tau(L, M) = \frac{1}{2}\) then whenever \(L \tilde L', M \tilde M'\) we have \(\tau(L, M) = \tau(L', M')\).</li>
<li>If \(\tau(L, pL + (1 - p) M)\) should be monotonic in \(p\), and whenever it is non-constant that monotonicity should be strict.</li>
<li>For any pure lotteries (that is, lotteries which take a single outcome with probability \(1\)) \(\tau(L, M) \in \{0, 1, \frac{1}{2}\). i.e. for any concrete outcomes the agent either has a strict preference or is indifferent between them.</li>
<li>\(\tau(L, pM + (1 - p)N) \geq \min \tau(L, M), \tau(L, N)\)</li>
</ol>


<p>Together with the continuity requirement, these give us roughly the equivalence of the first four <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">VNM axioms in Wikipedia's ordering</a>.</p>


<p>In contrast, the independence requirement obviously doesn't and can not hold in any meaningful sense for such an agent.
Pick two lotteries with \(L \prec M\). Consider \(\tau(pL + (1 - p)N, pM + (1 - p)N)\).
This is a continuous function of \(p\), and when \(p = 0\) it is equal to \(\frac{1}{2}\),
therefore for any \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) there must be some \(0 &lt; p &lt; 1\) we must have \(\tau(pL + (1 - p)N, pM + (1 - p)N) &lt; \epsilon\),
which breaks independence in a very strong way.</p>


<p>I think this lack of independence is in some sense the "essential difference" between a continuous and a discrete rational agent.</p>


<p>I'm not sure the above are the full set of axioms required. They feel a bit weak - I think more may need to be said about the relationships between \(\tau\) values over convex combinations of lotteries.</p>


<p>However,
the following two examples might be illuminating in terms of things that obviously <em>should</em> be considered rational agents:</p>


<p>Let \(\mu\) be some utility function over outcomes and let \(\alpha: [0, \infty) \to [0, 1]\) be monotonic decreasing with \(\alpha(0) = 1\) and \(\alpha(x) \to 0\) as \(x \to \infty\).
If \(E(\mu(L)) &gt; E(\mu(M))\) then let \(\tau(L, M) = \frac{1 - \alpha(E(\mu(L)) - E(\mu(M)))}{2}\).
Otherwise extend according to the requirement that \(\tau(L, M) = 1 - \tau(M, L)\).</p>


<p>The idea is basically that \(\alpha\) acts as a decision procedure about whether it's worth finding out more information - it represents the probability of giving up and flipping a coin. You run this procedure by observing to increasingly high precision until you either know that alpha is large enough that you should give up (based on a non-deterministic choice of doing so) or which side of the border you're on.</p>


<p>Another procedure that I think can not be realised as an instance of that but should still be considered rational is how a logically omniscient Bayesian agent who is only able to access the lotteries through sampling might behave.
You start with some prior distribution over lotteries (maybe an improper one) and query the sampler for each, with some cost function \(\alpha: \mathbb{N} \to [0, \infty)\) for how expensive it is to evaluate \(n\) samples (probably \(\alpha\) is a linear function). You stop and choose as soon as you hit a point where your expected value (under your posterior distributions) of acquiring more information is strictly less than the expected value of choosing one of the outcomes.</p>


<p>I don't want to suggest that either of the two above are the <em>only</em> possible rational agents in such circumstances.
I suspect in fact that there's a much broader diversity of behaviour possible than for VNM rational agents,
which might make any axiomatic classification hard.</p>

<p>Epistemic status: Confident.</p>


<p>Attention conservation notice: So much inside baseball.</p>


<p>Context: This is something I've known about for a while but couldn't find a concise write-up of that I had previously written and still liked,
so I thought I'd just rewrite it here.</p>


<hr/>


<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">Von-Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem</a> states that if you ask people to choose between finite lotteries over outcomes,
any "rational" behaviour looks like picking based on whichever gives the greatest expected utility according to some utility function over the outcomes.</p>


<p>I have a number of objections to this idea,
but my main one is this:
Regardless of the axioms you choose for rationality,
it's physically impossible to implement an agent that can express the sort of total order over lotteries that VNM rationality is a theorem about,
even if you grant the existence of logically omniscient agents (you can do it if you grant the existence of <em>actually</em> omniscient agents).</p>


<p>Why?</p>


<p>Well, suppose we have some total preorder \(\preceq \subseteq \mathcal{L}^2\), where \(\mathcal{L}\) is the set of lotteries over some finite set of outcomes.
Take this total order and define the choice function \(\tau : \mathcal{L}^2 \to \{-1, 0, 1\}\) where \(\tau(u, v) = 0\) if \(u \preceq v\) and \(v \preceq u\),
else if \(u \prec v\) then \(\tau(u, v) = -1 = -\tau(v, u)\). i.e. \(\tau\) is a function determining whether we strictly prefer one or are indifferent between the two.</p>


<p>Any choice that a physical agent makes must be based on a finite (but not necessarily bounded up front) set of observations.
Each of those observations can only give you information about the world up to some non-zero (but potentially arbitrarily small) tolerance.
In particular, if we have lotteries \(u_1 \preceq u_2\), there is some \(\epsilon &gt; 0\) such that if \(d((u_1, u_2), (v_1, v_2) &lt; \epsilon\),
we must have \(\tau(v_1, v_2) = \tau(u_1, u_2)\), because we only ever looked at \(u_1, u_2\) up to some finite precision.</p>


<p>In particular this means that \(\tau: \mathcal{L}^2 \to \{-1, 0, 1\}\) is a continuous function!</p>


<p>Unfortunately, \(\mathcal{L}^2\) is a connected topological space and \(\{-1, 0, 1\}\) is totally disconnected.
Thus any continuous function must be constant. We know that \(\tau(u, u) = 0\), so we must have \(\tau(u, v) = 0\) for all \(u, v\).
i.e. the only physically possible total preorder that we can express is the one that is totally indifferent between lotteries.</p>


<p>If the above argument makes no sense to you, another way to look at it is that you need to know \(u\) and \(v\) to infinite precision at the boundary.
If you are on a boundary point where \(\tau(u, v) = 0\), moving slightly in the direction of \(u \prec v\) immediately forces your hand,
so you cannot satisfy that continuity property at the boundary.</p>


<p>This problem can be made to go away by removing the indifferent set from the set of lotteries you consider - it's perfectly physically possible to distinguish the lotteries if you know a priori that you will definitely have a preference for one of them.
Unfortunately there are several problems with this:</p>


<ol>
<li>Where does that a priori knowledge come from? It's obviously not true in general - you have to somehow avoid ever being asked to choose between a lottery and itself.</li>
<li>The VNM axioms rely crucially on the use of indifference in the continuity axiom.</li>
<li>The implementation of such a choice function is still physically fraught, because as you approach the boundary the amount of precision you require to decide tends to infinity.</li>
</ol>


<p>It is possible that there is some cunning workaround that lets you rescue VNM choice theory, but I find it very implausible that this is the case.
The basic requirement that you construct a discrete function of the world is intrinsically aphysical, and it seems very hard to rescue that.</p>


<p>I have yet to sit down and think through exactly what I would like in its place in any great depth, mostly because nobody except me cares about this problem and I don't care enough to pursue it solo,
but my preferred primitive is to replace the choice function with a continuously varying choice probability, so instead you have a function  \(\tau: \mathcal{L}^2 \to [0, 1]\), where \(\tau(u, v)\) is the probability of choosing \(u\) over \(v\),
and \(\tau(v, u) = 1 - \tau(u, v)\).
This neatly side steps all of the problems with using a discrete choice function, because you don't need to know the outcome probabilities with infinite precision in order to make your choice, and \([0, 1]\) is a connected topological space so, unlike discrete choices, it's perfectly possible to construct such functions.</p>

<p>I previously wrote <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2014/10/order-dependence-in-preference-elicitation/">a post about NP-hardness in decision theory</a>.
On rereading it, I think its tone really doesn't help its point at all, so I thought I'd quickly write up a more formal version.</p>


<p>The basic point is this: If you don't assume computation is free, NP-hard problems prove an interesting barrier to decision making that satisfies the classical "rationality" axioms.</p>


<p>Suppose you have an NP-hard problem (say a SAT instance), \(S\), and are offered a choice between the following three options:</p>


<ol>
<li>A certain reward \(R_1\).</li>
<li>A reward \(R_2 &gt; R_1\) if a particular solution \(x\) witnesses that \(S\) is satisfiable.</li>
<li>A reward \(R_3 &gt; R_2\) if \(S\) is satisfiable.</li>
</ol>


<p>Arrange the values such that \(\alpha_2 \ll R_2 - R_1 &lt; R_3 - R_1 &lt; \alpha_3\),
where \(\alpha_i\) is the cost of solving the computational problem that would allow you to determine the pay off of these choices.
i.e. the difference in reward is big enough that it is worth evaluating one solution, but small enough that it's not worth solving the problem.</p>


<p>You should always strictly prefer \(3\) to \(2\),
because under every circumstance where \(2\) pays anything, \(3\) pays a larger amount.</p>


<p>Additionally, you should prefer \(2\) to \(1\) if and only if \(x\) <em>is</em> a witness - because it's cheap enough to check,
you just acquire the information and be done with it (if you want to quibble about expected payoffs, assume that \(\alpha_2\) is really really small).</p>


<p>However, you should also prefer \(1\) to \(3\),
because the possible reward you can gain by solving the problem is not worth the cost,
so you should take the certain reward instead.</p>


<p>This means that if \(x\) is chosen so that it <em>is</em> a witness,
you have an intransitive preference \(2 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1\).</p>


<p>Another way of thinking about this is that the choices over this problem are not <em>subset consistent</em>.
The choice you make from \(\{1, 2, 3\}\) in the case that \(x\) is a solution is either \(3\) - evaluating \(2\) tells you that it's worth choosing \(3\) over \(1\),
so you can skip paying the cost and just choose the good option. In contrast, your choice when picking from \(\{1, 3\}\) would be \(2\) - removing a value that was not the chosen answer has caused your opinion to flip.</p>

<p>Terry Tao has an interesting series of posts:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2009/11/05/the-no-self-defeating-object-argument/">The “no self-defeating object” argument</a></li>
<li><a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/10/18/the-no-self-defeating-object-argument-revisited/">The “no self-defeating object” argument, revisited</a></li>
<li><a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/11/02/the-no-self-defeating-object-argument-and-the-vagueness-paradox/">The “no self-defeating object” argument, and the vagueness paradox</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The idea of the "no self-defeating object" argument is, roughly, that suppose there were some some object that "defats" all objects,
then it would also defeat itself, and thus cannot exist. It's a specific form of reductio ad absurdum,
and can be applied to many different forms of "object" and notions of "defeat".</p>


<p>Examples:</p>


<ul>
<li>There is no largest number ("defeat" here meaning something like \(\geq n + 1\)).</li>
<li>There is no set of sets ("defeat" meaning \(\in\)).</li>
</ul>


<p>In the second post he outlines how we can almost always turn these arguments instead into "every object is defeated by some other object", and this often works better for people uncomfortable with proof by contradiction (which is most non-mathematicians).</p>


<p>The third post is especially interesting in the light of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-09-08-08:06.html">my recent post about the nature of mathematics</a>,
in that it observes that an unusual characteristic of mathematics is that mathematical statements are intended to have a precise meaning in a way that natural language statements typically are not.</p>


<p>This suggests the following modified definition:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is the study of unambiguous statements about hypothetical objects</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've been trying to come up with a definition of mathematics that I like and think would be useful in the course of teaching people mathematics.</p>


<p>This is of course a big ask, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_mathematics">according to Wikipedia there is a great deal of spirited philosophical debate on the subject</a>,
but on the other hand I think most of those definitions are <em>terrible</em>, so I don't feel too bad about trying myself.</p>


<p>The one I dislike the least from that list is <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mathematics.html">Eric Weisstein's</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is a broad-ranging field of study in which the properties and interactions of idealized objects are examined.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It's a bit long-winded but mostly captures the sense I want. The phrasing I've been thinking of in preference is something more like:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is the rigorous study of hypothetical objects.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The idea is that in mathematics we're not really concerned with real life physical objects,
we can just say "Suppose there were objects satisfying the following properties, what can we reliably say about them?"</p>


<p>Sometimes those objects are ones that can easily be realised as real physical objects. For example the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_chess_problem">Mathematics of Chess</a> studies hypothetical chess boards,
but those hypothetical chess boards can easily be realised by going out and buying an actual physical chessboard.
However, many of them can not be. There is no way to construct a real physical set of natural numbers,
but from a mathematical point of view that's OK - we can reason about the properties of the hypothetical one perfectly well.</p>


<p>There are a couple axes of variation on which people differ about the nature of mathematics:</p>


<ol>
<li>Is informal mathematics legitimate, or should all mathematics be considered a (possibly bad) approximation to an entirely formal set of reasoning rules?</li>
<li>Are some hypothetical objects privileged as the true platonic mathematical objects in a way that others are not?</li>
</ol>


<p>I think this definition is more or less compatible with any combination of answers to these questions:
Formalism is a question of what we count as "rigorous",
and even if there <em>are</em> platonic mathematical objects, we still must study them <em>as if</em> they were hypothetical because by its very nature we cannot have access to the platonic realm.</p>


<p>Traditionally the answers to these questions have been correlated more than I think is logically required:
The formalist position is that mathematics doesn't real and that everything is formal manipulation of symbols,
while the platonist position is that we are seeking to discover truths about the ideal platonic realm and the truths are what matter regardless of how we reason about them.</p>


<p>I think there's room for a third position though, which is that formalism is interesting but not strictly required, but the objects we describe have no inherent reality and really are allowed to be purely hypothetical.
I've historically self-described as a formalist, but I think this third position is closer to my true beliefs:
I don't think Platonism is philosophically defensible,
but I do think there is a lot of interesting mathematical content and activity that cannot be adequately captured by the formalist position.</p>


<p>In many ways this third position is that of Lakatos in his "Proofs and Refutations".
Most of the interesting mathematics happens in a fuzzy middle-ground where you are making your definitions precise enough to be defensible.
This could go all the way to formalism, but it doesn't have to.</p>


<p>The mathematics of chess is again an interesting test case here:
Chess is a purely arbitrary set of rules. I think it would be hard to argue that there is a platonic game of chess that is in some essential way different than it would have been if,
say, kings moved like knights or you could win by killing the queen <em>or</em> the king. These are both perfectly valid games that someone could play,
and there is a perfectly valid mathematics in studying them, but we study the mathematics of chess in preference to them because that is the actual game people play.</p>


<p>Conversely,
there really is a set of true statements about the game of chess (in an informal sense of chess),
and while mechanising and formalising the study of them might be <em>useful</em> for determining what they are, I think it's fair to say that what actually matters is whether the statement is true of real games of chess,
and the formalisation only matters to the degree that it helps us discover those truths.</p>


<p>I don't think the above definition is enough to fully reconstruct an idea of what mathematics is like,
because it leaves open two big questions:</p>


<ol>
<li>How do we select which hypothetical objects to study?</li>
<li>How do we study them?</li>
</ol>


<p>The answer to the first is comparatively easy, which is that it's based on what I think of as "The Three Good Reasons To Do Things":</p>


<ol>
<li>It's useful.</li>
<li>It's interesting.</li>
<li>Some asshole is forcing you to do something useless and boring.</li>
</ol>


<p>(Most people's encounters with mathematics is of type 3, sadly, which is why I always hear "Oh I <em>hated</em> mathematics at school" when I tell people I did mathematics at university)</p>


<p>Of course, point 2 is slightly subtle, because doing mathematics is much easier if other people have done similar mathematics, so you're constrained not just by what <em>you</em> think is interesting, but by what you can convince other people is interesting.</p>


<p>The second question is the hard part, and I think we currently do a very poor job of explaining it to people. I need to think further about it.</p>

<dl class="metadata">

<p>The thing I called <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-08-30-07:50.html">the Feynmann style</a> relates to Tim Gowers's <a href="https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~wtg10/2cultures.pdf">The Two Cultures of Mathematics</a>,
where he suggests that there are two cultures of mathematics: Theory building and problem solving. The latter tends to get organised not along the lines of general big ideas and broad theorems,
but instead along heuristics and guiding principles.</p>


<p>Gowers refers to the areas of mathematics that are primarily problem-solving as <em>combinatorial</em>,
but I feel like this kind of problem solving is one that it doesn't seem right to refer to as combinatorial - it's more... calculation?</p>


<p>There's a similar sense of being guided by heuristics and general ideas though.</p>


<p>For example, one general idea is "replace annoying terms with integrals over some new variables, then swap out the variable".</p>


<p>Suppose we didn't know what \(\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n}\) was.
How would we deal with this?</p>


<p>(Note: There's all sorts of playing fast and loose with convergence in this post that you can shore up later with some proper calculation but I'm not actually going to do. That's very common in this sort of proof).</p>


<p>Well, that \(\frac{1}{n}\) is an annoying term. Lets get rid of it with.
A classic way of doing this is to replace it with \(\int\limits_0^1 x^{n - 1} dx\).</p>


<p>We can now do the computation as follows:</p>


<p>\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^{n - 1} \frac{1}{n} &amp; = \sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty (-1)^{n - 1} \int\limits_0^1 x^{n - 1} \\
&amp; = \sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty (-1)^n \int\limits_0^1 x^n \\
&amp; = \int\limits_0^1 \sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty (-x)^n \\
&amp; = \int\limits_0^1 \frac{1}{1 + x} \\
&amp; = \ln(1 + x) \\
\end{align}</p>


<p>Roughly the steps here are:</p>


<ol>
<li>Try replacing tricky terms with integrals over simpler terms</li>
<li>Use standard sums that you already know the answer for</li>
<li>Try swapping sums and integrations</li>
</ol>


<p>Another useful calculational heuristic is "try changing the variable".</p>


<p>e.g. what's the limit as \(n \to \infty\) of \(n \ln (1 + \frac{1}{n})\)?</p>


<p>Well, let \(x = \frac{1}{n}\). This expression is now \(\frac{ln(1 + x)}{x} = \frac{ln(1 + x) - \ln(1)}{x}\) as \(x \to 0\).
i.e. it's the derivative of \(\ln\) at \(1\), i.e. \(1\).</p>


<p>It's hard to explain exactly what the thought process is here. It's like solving a puzzle - you have a bunch of known tricks that you think might work and you try to apply them all.
If you were to mechanize the process then it wuold end up looking like a brute force solver for the problem, but by using intuition you can kinda guide the way.</p>


<p>I think maybe one part of the split between problem-solving and theory building is how much of what you end up building escapes the head of the mathematician building it:
Problem-solving skills are much harder to teach to another person than theory is (once that other person has build the skill of acquiring theory, which is also hard to teach)</p>

<p>There's a thing that happens in Vernor Vinge's "A Deepness in the Sky" where the Evil Overlord ™ is experimenting with different configurations you can put a group mind in.
I sometimes think about this as an analogy for how to construct better modes of group problem solving (in a non-evil-overlord way that in no way involves my using the army of crows that I don't have to impose my will on the unsuspecting masses. Yes) .</p>


<p>In particular, I think it's often actively useful for someone to explicitly take an adversarial role in a group discussion,
and it improves the resulting group's intelligence.
The difficulty is that you need to do this in a context where the group consents to this, and with a fairly explicit discussion in advance of boundaries.
It also helps to be able to ask the adversary to step out of the adversarial role and clarify their position.</p>

<p class="subtitle">When come back bring pie(s)</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>There's a metaphor people use: Some people fight for a larger slice of the pie, others see that it's better to enlarge the pie.</p>


<p>I've seen this metaphor used for everything from intersectional feminism to the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork's extremely libertarian brand despotism.
Broadly the point is this: It's better to build a positive sum game where everyone benefits than it is to compete in a zero or negative sum game.</p>


<p>The relationship between this point and the metaphor is interesting.
I agree with the thing that I am claiming to be the underlying point (but then I would), but I think what the actual metaphor demonstrates is also interesting:
People don't understand how pies work.</p>


<p>What happens when you build a bigger pie?</p>


<ol>
<li>You run into scaling issues, limited both by the size of your oven and also (if you build a better oven) the square-cube law (actually I'm not sure if this is the square-cube law at work, as pies tend to be scaled horizontally faster than they are scaled vertically, but either way once your pie gets big enough it's very hard to ensure it's cooked all the way through - you end up with overdone outsides and and underdone middle).</li>
<li>The same people who couldn't eat your smaller pie still can't eat your larger one.6</li>
</ol>


<p>The correct solution is not to enlarge the pie. It's to <em>bake more pies</em>, and also the provide tasty food that is not pie because not everyone likes pie.</p>


<p>If you've ever tried catering to a diverse group of dietary requirements, at some point you hit the point where you realise that it's much much easier to make multiple dishes than it is to try to create a single dish that can feed everyone.
A vegan gluten free nut free diabetic friendly pie is certainly possible, but it is a pie that basically nobody is going to <em>want</em> to eat.
In contrast, a wide variety of desserts that can cater to each particular restriction that your group encounters,
without attempting to shoehorn everyone into a one size fits all badly model.</p>


<p>The Unit of Caring has a notion she uses a lot of <em>competing access needs</em>.
She <a href="https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/135162290121/hi-i-have-a-quick-question-i-tried-googling-but">explains it well here</a>,
but the important quote (to save you from Tumblr's giant GDPR screen) is:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Competing access needs is the idea that some people, in order to be able to participate in a community, need one thing, and other people need a conflicting thing, and instead of figuring out which need is ‘real’ we have to acknowledge that we can’t accommodate all valid needs.
I originally encountered it in disability community conversations: for example, one person might need a space where they can verbally stim, and another person might need a space where there’s never multiple people talking at once. Both of these are valid, but you can’t accommodate them both in the same space.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Trying to build a space that works for everyone is more or less impossible, and what you will end up with is a space that works badly for everyone.
Instead we need the ability to have multiple spaces which we acknowledge as valid and allow people to freely move between these spaces as long as they are prepared to accept the local rules.</p>


<p>In an interesting coincidence, this came up in a completely different context recently.
A while back <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/05/randomizing-lean-coffee/">I sketched out a way of using randomization to improve the design of Lean Coffee meetups</a>.
<a href="https://twitter.com/georgesdubus/status/1037957014599749632">This morning a friend reported</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I used to organize David-Style lean coffees at my previous job. (...)
The interesting limitation we ran into is that toward the end, the attendence was two groups with mostly disjoint interests.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The nice thing about small-scale democratic processes like this is that splitting the union is a completely legitimate move.
If you have two groups with disjoint interests, why not run them as two groups? Ideally at different times so that people who really <em>are</em> interested in both can attend both.</p>


<p>How to do this sort of thing at a larger scale seems to be one of the great unsolved problems of society.</p>

<p>Follow on to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-09-05-13:24.html">misc thoughts about voting design for talk scheduling</a>.</p>


<p>Here's how a system that is much closer to classic STV could work.
Assume everyone has a ranking of all the talks they wish to attend (this isn't actually reasonable to ask for, but you could get people to score talks according to some ordinal scores and then randomly tie break, or tie break in organiser preferred order or something).</p>


<p>The system has the following three parameters:</p>


<ol>
<li>The number of time slots.</li>
<li>The number of talks per time slot.</li>
<li>The minimum number of attendees required for a talk to be worthwhile (should be at least one). Callt his the threshold.</li>
</ol>


<p>You also need to pick a quota system. Either the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_the_Hare_and_Droop_quotas">Droop or the Hare quota</a> are the obvious choices.
My natural bias is to use the Hare quota, as it's better for minority interests and I think that's a nice feature to have in your conference talk selection (conferences have a tendency to have the same talks over and over again and I think this would help offset that).</p>


<p>The system could easily be adapted to more complicated constraints in which not all talk/time slot combinations are valid, but I'm going to ignore that.</p>


<p>Conceptually what happens is everyone is given one voting-buck,
and a talk slot "costs" an amount of voting-bucks equal to the quota.
People band together to form buying blocs and each spend the same percentage of their remaining pool of voting money to buy a slot (this is basically how normal STV works too).</p>


<p>The system involves running the following process to a fixed point:</p>


<ol>
<li>Set the list of eligible talks to all talks which have at least the threshold number of people voted for them.</li>
<li>Give everyone exactly one vote (note: as the process evolves, people will have fractional votes).</li>
<li>People vote for (talk, slot) pairs, where the slot has not already been filled and the talk is both eligible and not yet scheduled.
   They will vote for a pair if:<ol>
<li>The talk their highest ranked talk among the available talks.</li>
<li>If there are slots which have no talks they want to see in them, they will only vote for pairs in those slots.
   Otherwise they will vote for pairs where they prefer the talk to the one currently scheduled there.
   Note that a voter can vote for multiple (talk, slot) pairs.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If there are no such pairs, we have scheduled all of the talks we can (even if there still unfilled slots). Stop and report this as the schedule.</li>
<li>If any of the pairs has a total number of votes exceeding the quota, pick the one with the most votes and schedule that.
   For each voter who voted for it, multiply their remaining vote by \(1 - \frac{q}{r}\), where \(q\) is the quota and \(r\) is the total vote for the elected slot
   (i.e. we've removed \(q\) from their total vote and everybody pays it equally).</li>
<li>If no pair was elected, take the talk with the lowest maximum vote over all vote pairs, and remove it from the list of eligible talks.</li>
<li>If a pair was elected, now check if any talks can no longer meet the threshold - i.e. if for every slot you could schedule them in,
   count the number of people for whom that is their favourite talk in that slot. If there are no slots where this exceeds the threshold, remove the talk from the eligible list.</li>
<li>If we removed any talks from the eligible list, reset all of the state except the list of eligible talks and go back to step 2. Otherwise go back to step 3.</li>
</ol>


<p>Most of this is just variant STV, with some of the specific details owing to specific types of STV.
The main difference is that because the same voter may cast their vote for multiple options simultaneously,
we need to be careful not to elect more than one "candidate" at once,
plus the specialised drop-out rule for talks that fail to meet the threshold.</p>


<p>Most of my problems with it are the same as my problems with STV in general: It looks like an iterative optimisation process, but it's not at all clear what it is you are optimising for.
So it might work well, but I'm not really sure how you would measure "well" in this context.
It seems plausibly worth a try though.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Mechanisms for talk scheduling and voting</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-05</dd>
</dl>


<p>I've been thinking about mechanism design for conference scheduling again.
I've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkusHEBOhmQ">previously argued that conference scheduling should be treated as an optimisation problem</a>,
but I no longer believe that's true.</p>


<p>In particular I think the following hold:</p>


<ul>
<li>If we treat talk selection as a voting problem, we must employ some mechanism of proportional representation</li>
<li>In a multi-track conference, scheduling and selection cannot be separated.</li>
</ul>


<p>Lets see some examples in support of this.</p>


<p>Suppose you're running a Python conference, and 60% of the people attending are web developers and 40% are data scientists.
You put together a set of talk proposals, people vote on them, and you take all of the top voted talks.
What you end up with is of course a conference consisting entirely of web development talks.</p>


<p>(Note: Despite the running Python example, this post is not actually about <a href="https://2018.hq.pyconuk.org/schedule/">The PyCon UK Schedule</a>, which I've barely looked at.)</p>


<p>For some contexts maybe that's OK, but given that a lot of the value in conferences is the hallway track, it's nice to be able to put together heterogenous conferences.
You could fix this by artificially selecting for certain subjects, but proportional representation seems like a much better approach because it doesn't require you to know all the ways in which your audience is heterogenous in advance.
So, in the above example, we would have roughly 60% web dev talks and 40% data science talks,
but also if it turned out that about 10% of the audience were really excited about Flask,
we could have about 10% Flask talks.</p>


<p>If the conference is single-track we're more or less done: Pick your favourite (non party-list based, so probably some variant of STV), proportional voting system,
use that to select your talks, and call it a day.</p>


<p>I'd like to pause here by saying that I'm increasingly a fan of single track conferences, so I think "do a single track conference and call it a day" might actually be the correct solution.</p>


<p>But lets suppose you're less on board with that and want a multi-track conference.</p>


<p>For simplicity, lets imagine that our Python conference now has two rooms,
with talks running in the same time slots in each room,
and attendees now have to choose which of the two to attend.
Lets say it's a single day conference and there are five time slots,
so ten talks.</p>


<p>According to our above PR argument, we should run six web dev talks,
but does it really make sense for us to do so?
There are only five time slots,
so (by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle">the pigeonhole principle</a> if you want to get fancy about it) you're inevitably going to put two web dev talks back to back.
That might be OK - maybe you're scheduling a Django and a Flask talk against each other - but maybe there's a strict preference where there are five obviously best web dev talks and the sixth is pretty good (preferable by web devs to any data science talk) but not good enough (will not get any attendees when scheduled against any of the top five talks). What's the point in selecting that talk given that?</p>


<p>In the other direction, lets say we have 20% of the audience who are really interested in random forests,
and so we select two random forests talks,
which we then proceed to schedule in the same time slot.
Now despite 20% representation at the talk level,
they only have 10% representation at the time slot level!</p>


<p>(I want to draw an analogy to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a> here but I don't think it quite works)</p>


<p>So, tracking creates an upper bound on how much proportional representation is worth doing, and also scheduling within those tracks affects the amount of proportionality you actually get.</p>


<p>So what to do about it?</p>


<p>Well, I'm not entirely sure. I started designing a whole complex system in support of this that this note was originally supposed to be about, but I decided I didn't like it very much.</p>


<p>The basic ideas were:</p>


<ol>
<li>Give each participant a "voting currency" - everyone starts with an equal amount, and talk slots effectively get auctioned off, with the proceeds distributed among everyone equally (possibly among everyone who still has any interest in attending remaining talks).</li>
<li>Participants will only vote for talks in slots that are strictly better for them than the talks already scheduled in that slot.</li>
<li>Define a threshold of "Minimum number of people required to be worth running a talk". Whenever a talk no longer would meet that requirement (because every slot it could be scheduled in has talks people prefer more), it is immediately excluded and the process restarts from the beginning. This is akin to how exclusions work in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wright_system">The Wright System of STV</a>, and is designed to avoid "spoiler" talks, where people who preferred them effectively get screened off from voting in the process until the talk is excluded.</li>
</ol>


<p>The details kinda became a weird hybrid of STV and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey%E2%80%93Clarke%E2%80%93Groves_mechanism">Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism</a> and the more I looked at it the less convinced I became that it was the right way to do things or that I actually understood how the VCG mechanism plays out in practice.</p>


<p>I do think the above examples are important to consider though.</p>

<p class="subtitle">My parents, Ayn Rand and God</p>

</dl>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bazzalisk/status/1037277763219152897">From bazzalisk on Twitter</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>“You know him better than I” and “You know him better than me” are both grammatically valid but mean different things</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The former means "You know him better than I do", the latter means "You know him better than you know me".</p>


<p>The title of this note comes from the following probably-apocryphal book dedication,
used as an argument for the oxford comma:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This book is dedicated to my parents, Ayn Rand and God.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Without the Oxford comma,
the implication is that the author's parents are Ayn Rand and God,
with the Oxford comma, this is a dedication to four people (the author's parents, and also to Ayn Rand and God).
<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/33637/best-shots-fired-oxford-comma-wars">Mental Floss has a bunch of similar ones</a>.</p>


<p><a href="http://msgboard.snopes.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic;f=95;t=000863;p=0">Snopes think this probably never happened</a>,
but OTOH the following is part of their argument:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Since Rand was such an outspoken atheist, I find it hard to believe that anyone would mention both her and God as sources of inspiration.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>And, well, this seems to ignore the existence of Paul Ryan and a significant chunk of the US political right.
Also I'm now amused by the idea of Ayn Rand's atheism being a reaction to God being a deadbeat dad.
Someone should write that fanfic, but it's not going to be me.</p>


<p>There is of course <a href="https://amzn.to/2LYsLcz">an entire book about comedic misinterpretations due to bad grammar</a>,
but that's not exactly what's going on here:
Instead these are interesting grammatically valid examples that are right on the edge of ambiguity.</p>


<p>It's unclear to me whether this actually tells us anything useful.
We could probably derive some normative advice about correct use of grammar from it,
but this sort of thinking about things in terms of their edge cases is a very modern-mathematician view of the world,
which doesn't come very naturally to others.</p>


<p>The general widely deployed solution to linguistic ambiguity is instead that we just guess or ask,
and frankly that probably works better than trying to remove it.</p>

<h2><a href="/posts/2018-09-02-21:22.html">2018-09-02</a></h2>


<p class="subtitle">Fiction for Kristian</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>This is a small collection of fiction I've written that I like enough to actively recommend and think count as "finished".</p>


<h3>Fan fiction</h3>


<p>The two pieces of Stargate fan fiction that I've written and would recommend are <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335">Stargate Physics 101</a> and <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5023654">Interview with a System Lord</a>.
Both are not only canon-compatible (more or less. Stargate Physics 101 doesn't quite line up with Stargate Universe, but I don't care about Universe),
but are 100% my headcanons of how the universe works.</p>


<p>Completion status: 100% finished standalone pieces. I may write other Stargate fan fiction at some point, and if I do then as part of the universe's canon those will naturally be part of its backstory,
but there will never be sequels per se to these pieces.</p>


<p>Recommendation strength: Stargate Physics 101 is one of my most popular pieces and works even if you have never watched Stargate. If you like any of infrastructure science fiction, software testing, or stargate, it's worth reading.
Interview with a System Lord is worth reading if and only if you like Stargate SG1 (and especially if you like Ba'al) and want a moderately amusing story exploring a weird headcanon. Warning: May cause mild sympathy for the devil.</p>


<p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/4637439/chapters/10575111">The Rules of Wishing</a> is a piece of fan fiction of Disney's Aladdin.
Premise:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What if people were good at wishing? The Genie's rules have holes you could drive a herd of camels through, but they don't have to. Aladdin and Jafar's wishes are shallow and limited, and lack the foresight that really effective wishing entails, but wouldn't a battle between effective wishers be much more interesting? And while we're at it, why does Jasmine have so little agency and basically act as a prize to be won in a battle between two men when literally the entire point of her narrative is that she's not that?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It has been argued to be rational!fic though I'm not sure I agree with the classification.
Jasmine in this is probably my joint favourite character I've ever written.</p>


<p>Completion status: Has a mini non-canon sequel <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13523703">The Consequences of Wishing</a> that explains the divergence between this story and the film.
May, but probably won't, spawn another sequel, but the current ending wraps it up entirely to my satisfaction and any sequel would be a new story in the same universe with the same characters rather than a continuation of this story.</p>


<p>Trigger warning: Moderately violent.</p>


<p>Recommendation strength: Honestly, you should read this if you like my fiction at all and are not put off by the trigger warning.</p>


<p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13354146">Counterparts</a> is a crossover fic between Lucifer (the TV show) and Old Harry's Game (the radio show).</p>


<p>Completion status: Very standalone. It's not impossible I may do a followup involving The Good Place, but it stands on its own regardless of whether I do.</p>


<p>Recommendation strength: Well it amuses <em>me</em>. Based on feedback, if you like Lucifer it will probably also amuse you. Familiarity with the Old Harry's Game is helpful but not strictly required.</p>


<h3>Original Fiction</h3>


<p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/9233966/chapters/20941043">Programmer at Large</a> is a story about gender, social anxiety, and legacy code.
It seems to have a lot of fans.</p>


<p>Completion status: Abandoned, but it kinda works that way. It's a series of slice of life chapters, and the protagonist's life is never really "finished". However it definitely has some unsatisfying dangling plot threads that will never be resolved. However most of the strength of this story is at the chapter level anyway - it has some of my best writing in it, but as a whole story I do not feel that it works. I intend at some point to take it apart and refactor and modularise it into several smaller stories. I am fully aware of the irony of saying this about a story about legacy code.</p>


<p>Recommendation strength: Mixed. There's some stuff in there I really like, and a lot of people seem to love it, but like I said I don't feel that it hangs together in its current incarnation.</p>


<p><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/754683">The Diaries of Vicky Frankenstein</a> more normally AKA "The Vicky Stories". Series of short stories about Dr Vicky Frankenstein and her adventures in joining a biotech startup run by the vampire Ada Lovelace.</p>


<p>Completion Status: (Hopefully permanently) incomplete in the sense that I fully intend to keep writing Vicky stories (but don't more than about one every six months), but each Vicky story is a complete standalone short story that happens to be set in the same world and use the same characters. There are minimal to no dangling plot threads between the stories.</p>


<p>Recommendation Status: I ♥ writing Vicky and think you should read these. Also, contains a (99% SFW) lesbian sex scene between two amoral monsters that reviewers describe as "ridiculously adorable", so there's that.</p>

<p>In general often the right way to judge an action is not actually on its immediate effects,
but on what long-run effect they will have on the sort of people you will surround yourself with.
This can make seemingly good actions harmful and seemingly bad or nonsensical ones quite useful.</p>


<p>I think about this a bunch in the context of codes of conduct:
Often the benefit of the code of conduct is not whether it is ever enforced,
but that it filters out people who don't like codes of conduct.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notation for test-case reducers</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-01</dd>
</dl>


<p>A thing I've been noticing recently is that it's really useful to have compact notation for describing things.
Usually this is equivalent to primivitives + some combinators.</p>


<p>One thing that I think it would be useful to have such a notation for is (greedy) test-case reduction passes.
They combine pretty well, and it makes it useful to discuss various things.</p>


<p>For example, if you have reducers \(A\), \(B\), you can define the reducer \(AB\) which runs \(A\), then
runs \(B\) on its result. You can also define the reducer \(A^+\) which runs \(A\) to a fixed point.</p>


<p>Another interesting combinator is \(/\). \(A / B\) runs \(A\), then runs \(B\) if \(A\) didn't do anything..</p>


<p>There are a bunch of really basic algebraic relations that hold, like composition and \(/\) are associative,
and \((A^+)^+ = A^+\), but not a huge amount beyond that.</p>


<p>A bunch of interesting questions about test-case reduction can be compactly expressed in this notation though.
For example, suppose you want to reduce to something that is a fixed point of both \(A\) and \(B\).
You could do \((AB)^+\), but you could also do \((A^+B^+)^+\), and it's quite natural to do this in some contexts.
My suspicion, which I've yet to verify, is that it's almost never the right thing to do.</p>


<p>You can kinda regard the quadratic mode failure of greedy search as an instance of this problem:
If \(\delta_i\) is the operation that deletes the element at position \(i\), the correct pass to run for greedy deletion is \((\delta_0^+ \ldots \delta_n^+)^+\),
but if you start again at the beginning every time you succeed you are running \((\delta_0 / \ldots / \delta_n)^+\).</p>

<p class="subtitle">Can a machine design?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-09-01</dd>
</dl>


<p><a href="http://echo.iat.sfu.ca/library/cross_01_machine_des.pdf">Can a machine design?</a> by Nigel Cross is an interesting paper about architecture (the real kind!) and its relation to automation.
I found it via Adam Marshall Smith's PhD thesis <a href="https://adamsmith.as/papers/mechanizing_exploratory_game_design_book.pdf">Mechanizing exploratory game design</a> (truthfully via <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkreminski/status/964923822766833664">this tweet</a> about it from Max Kreminski),
which is an excellent thesis on mechanically assisted creativity (I must admit I skimmed the technical content as less relevant to me - I care about the meta more than I care about game design qua game design).</p>


<p>Most relevant quote for me:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Despite this apparently
easy pace of interaction, all of the designers reported that they
found the experiments hard work and stressful. They reported that
the main benefit of using the "computer" was increased work
speed, principally by reducing uncertainty (i.e., they relatively
quickly received answers to queries, which they accepted as reliable
information).
I also tried a few variations from my standard experiments. The most interesting was to reverse the normal set of expectations of the functions of the designer and the "computer."
The "computer" was given the job of having to produce a design to the
satisfaction of the observing designer. It immediately was apparent
that, in this situation, there was no stress on the designer—in fact, it
became quite fun—and it was the "computer" that found the experience
to be hard work. </p>
</blockquote>


<p>i.e. it's much more fun to tweak a computer's output than it is to be critiqued by one.
An important observation for people in correctness research I think!</p>

<p class="subtitle">Some free user experience consulting for Google</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-08-31</dd>
</dl>


<p>I am not a UX expert. I've worked with people who are, and I'm probably a lot better than my otherwise utter incompetence at front-end work would suggest,
but I'm at best OK.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, as a user I get to see a lot of the sharp edge of the problems, and I'm good enough at UX that I think I can see what the shape of the solution is.</p>


<p>The product I would like to offer Google some free advice on is the following: Google Maps's driving navigation.</p>


<p>On a related note, if you can recommend a good driving navigation app to me (iPhone, sadly), that would be delightful.
It would be especially useful if it were one that understood features of English roads like "has roundabouts" and "is verrah verrah smol" that seem alien to people from the US (although given how much of Google maps is in Zurich,
I'm still surprised by its failure to understand these).</p>


<p>Anyway, free UX consulting.
User stories are cool I hear, so here are my two user stories for Google maps:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>As a driver, I would like to survive my trip.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>and</p>


<blockquote>
<p>As a driver, I would like to be able to drive without a constant sense of paranoia.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Currently Google Maps fails both of these so hard that I have conjectured that I have somehow triggered a special murder-mode for ex-Googlers,
because honestly if Google Maps treats most drivers like it treats me then either not many people can be using it or I would have expected a better publicised death toll from it.
I am not actually being hyperbolic here (or even parabolic).</p>


<p>Google maps reliably does everything in its power to destroy my trust in it, which is not ideal in something that I have to use while driving.</p>


<p>As the most basic minimum that would be required to restore my trust, I would like to propose the following feature:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Google maps should never, under any circumstances, exit navigation without an audible confirmation that it has done so.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>There is what is almost certainly a bug in Google maps where sometimes it just goes "lol, I'm done here" and exits navigation without telling me.
This is <em>functionally indistinguishable</em> from the sort of confirmation Google maps uses to tell me to just keep going straight.
As a result, whenever Google maps is silent for an extended period of time, I end up feeling a gnawing sense of paranoia that it's just not telling me what to do and I'm going in completely the wrong direction.</p>


<p>Almost all of the time this is not the case and the correct thing to do is to keep going straight (although Google maps's notion of what "keep going straight" is is often very funny and involves amusing interpretations of the word "going straight" that include things like "turning left" - it is not very good at actually knowing where the road markings are, and if the road follows around to the right it will often confuse a left turn with keep going straight. However, I will forgive it data problems, particularly on the weird back country roads I often drive),
but this bug triggers just often enough (last incidence: about an hour ago) that the exceedingly common operation of <em>driving in a straight line</em> fills me with deep unease whenever I use Google maps for navigation.</p>


<p>Even if this bug were fixed, the damage is done, and I will never believe Google maps is still running if it is silent.</p>


<p>On top of that, I would like to propose the following feature:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Google maps should never be silent for an extended period of time.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I'll grant that if the last instructions were "Keep going for 500 miles" it doesn't need to give me a mile counter every five minutes,
but if it could tell me every half hour or so "Yup, everything is cool, keep going" that would be great.
In normal operation,
every five minutes sounds about right.</p>


<p>The second source of paranoia is that Google maps gives absolutely no feedback as to when you have done something wrong.
I know the whole nagging satnav going "Make a U-Turn. Make a U-Turn. Make a- *urk* (noise as satnav is thrown out window)" has a bad reputation,
but there's a happy medium: When you do something Google maps does not expect,
it should say something along the lines of "You missed a turn, I'm going to try to turn you around" or "You missed a turn, finding a new route".</p>


<p>Fun instances where it was very useful to have a second person in the car yesterday:</p>


<ol>
<li>When Google maps took me 30 miles up the wrong motorway before eventually turning me around.</li>
<li>When Google maps was very upset that I didn't drive through the traffic cones blocking the route it wanted me to take and insistently tried to turn me around for another go.</li>
</ol>


<p>Feedback that I had done the wrong thing would have been very helpful on the first, because I would have spent a lot of time confused without it.
Feedback on the second that it was taking me around for another pass would also have been very helpful. I would have probably ignored its instructions even without Luke to assist me,
but I would have felt much less certain about it.</p>


<p>Anyway, those is the main sources of paranoia.
Lets talk about the other moderately important feature:
Not dying and/or killing people.</p>


<p>This is a very simple issue:
Google maps literally never gives you enough advance warning.
This is especially true in the following two cases:</p>


<ul>
<li>with motorway driving. If you tell me "In one mile, take the exit" when I am doing 70 mph (yes, um, definitely 70 mph, that's the speed limit after all) in the right hand lane of a motorway,
  you are saying "In the next 30 seconds, merge across three lanes of possibly quite busy traffic". This is a style of advice that will literally kill people and, worse, make them miss their turning.</li>
<li>with roundaboutes and other turnings where there is a lane you need to be in, I need to know what lane that is <em>before</em> reaching the roundabout. It happens all the time that I either exit a roundabout,
  leave a motorway and Google maps is like "tum ti tum, la la, nothing to see here, oh hey there's a roundabout coming up. Atttt... theeee.... rouuuundabout.... taaaake..... the.... third... exit....".
  Often I am <em>on the fucking roundabout</em> before it tells me what lane I need to be in.</li>
</ul>


<p>Giving this sort of last minute instruction is deeply unsafe,
and needs to stop.</p>


<p>On top of that there's all sorts of data problems and things where Google maps just clearly doesn't understand UK roads,
but I don't realistically expect those to be fixed, especially with the UK dooming itself to irrelevance next year and the only Google UK presence being in a city where you already have to embrace paranoia and risk loss of life and limb to drive in anyway, so I won't bother venting about those now.</p>


<p>In the meantime, I'm serious about that desire for recommendations of less murdery navigation apps. Please?</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brzozowski_derivative">Brzozowski derivative</a>,
introduced in "Derivatives of regular expressions" by Janusz A. Brzozowski.</p>


<p>The basic idea is that given some language \(L\) over an alphabet \(A\),
and some string \(u\) over \(L\),
you can define the derivative language \(\partial(L, u) = \{v: uv \in L\}\).
We can extend this further (and it will be useful to do so below).
If \(M\) is some other language, we can define \(\partial(L, M) = \{v: \exists u \in M, uv \in L\}\).
I'm not currently sure if the derivative of a regular language by a regular langauge is regular in general. It is in the case we'll see later,
and I suspect it is in general.</p>


<p>This seems like a pretty trivial observation until you realise the following three things:</p>


<ol>
<li>\(u \in L\) if and only if \(\epsilon \in \partial(L, u)\)</li>
<li>\(uv \in L\) if and only if \(v \in \partial(L, u)\)</li>
<li>For most common representations of languages, it's actually pretty easy to calculate a representation of their derivative.</li>
</ol>


<p>Putting these together, you can use the Brzozowski derivative to calculate a deterministic (not necessarily finite!) automaton for almost any language that you can easily represent.
You label states with descriptions of languages,
a state is accepting if it matches the empty string,
and transitions to the states labelled by the derivatives.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/turon/re-deriv.pdf">Regular-expression derivatives reexamined</a> by Owens et al. has some nice practical details of doing this in the context of functional programming.</p>


<p>To see this in action, consider the standard regular expression operators.
These satisfy the following identifies:</p>


<ol>
<li>\(\partial(A | B, u) = \partial(A, u) | \partial(B, u)\)</li>
<li>\(\partial(AB, u) = \partial(A, u)B | \nu(A) \partial(B, u)\), where \(\nu(A) = \epsilon\) if \(\epsilon \in A\) or \(\emptyset\) otherwise (i.e. the derivative can skip over \(A\) if and only if \(A\) contains the empty string)</li>
<li>\(\partial(A^*, u) = \partial(A, u) A^*\)</li>
</ol>


<p>A result proved in Brzozowski's original paper (apparently. I can't currently seem to access it, and am going off thecite in "Regular-expression derivatives reexamined) is that a small number of reasonable normalisation rules over the representation of the language is enough to ensure that you only get finitely many states in the state machine generated by partial derivatives of regular expressions.
It's certainly true that you only get finitely many if you have full equivalence for the regular languages labelling the states - the derivative automaton is actually the minimal automaton representing a language.</p>


<p>There are two very nice things about this representation of the language's automaton though:</p>


<ol>
<li>It can be done <em>lazily</em>. This means that even when your deterministic automaton has exponentially (or infinitely!) many states, you only ever need to explore the states that you walk when matching strings.</li>
<li>It is very easy to extend with new operators.</li>
</ol>


<p>An example of (2) is that regular expressions reexamined actually does it for extended regular expressions with intersection and negation, because might as well right? It's no harder than doing it with the normal ones, even though adding these to your regular expression language can cause exponential blowup in the size of the automata compiled from your regex.</p>


<p>But there are even more interesting ones if you're prepared to go for more esoteric operations!</p>


<p>Have you heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_automaton">Levenshtein automaton</a>? The set of strings within some finite edit distance of another string is a regular language and you can define a nice automaton matching it.
But in fact, a stronger result is true: For any regular language \(L\) and natural number \(n\), the set \(E(L, n) = \{u: \exists v \in L, d(u, v) \leq n\}\) is a regular language.
Why?</p>


<p>Well, we can calculate its derivative!
The derivative of \(E\) is \(\partial(E(L, n), u) = E(\partial(L, u), n) | E(L, n - 1) | E(\partial(L, \cdot), n - 1) | \partial(E(\partial(L, \cdot), n - 1), u)\).
That is, at each character we can either:</p>


<ol>
<li>Continue matching the original language (cost 0).</li>
<li>Insert a new character in front of something in the original language (cost 1)</li>
<li>Replace a character in the original language with \(u\) (cost 1)</li>
<li>Drop a character from the original language and try again (cost 1)</li>
</ol>


<p>In the course of doing this we apply the following rewrite rules:</p>


<ol>
<li>\(E(L, 0) = L\)</li>
<li>\(E(\emptyset, n) = \emptyset\)</li>
</ol>


<p>As long as the number of reachable representations for the original languages is finite,
so is the number of reachable states in our Levenshtein construction:
Every state is labelled by a set of languages of the form \(E(\partial(L, U), k)\) where \(U\) is a language defined by \(u_1 \ldots u_m\) with each \(u_i\) either a single character or a \(\cdot\),
and \(m + k \leq n\). There are only finitely many such labels as long as there are only finitely many derivatives of \(L\),
although in principle there may be exponentially many.
Because of the laziness of our construction that often won't matter - you can still determine membership for a string of length \(k\) with only \(O(k)\) state traversals (though calculating those states could in principle require up to \(O(nm)\) work, where \(m\) is the number of states in the original automaton).</p>


<p>You can also use this to determine the minimum edit distance between two regular languages,
because you can test whether \(E(L, n) \cap L' = \emptyset\) by calculating and walking the generated DFA for the left hand side,
so this gives you a decision procedure for \(d(L, L') \leq n\).</p>


<p>Is this a practical algorithm? Not sure. I've played with it a little bit, but I've not really put it to the test,
but I think it's an interesting example of the flexibility of the Brzozowski derivative,
and it was at least mildly surprising to me that the edit ball of a regular language is itself regular.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Mathjax and Python Markdown</p>


<dl class="metadata">

</dl>


<p>I've been having an interesting time of things with this notebook and getting Python markdown and Mathjax to play well with each other.
In particular I have not been enjoying the markdown extension API at <em>all</em>.</p>


<p>Anyway, it turns out that it is easy to do what I need, just slightly undocumented and with some annoyingly silent failure modes.</p>


<p>Here is the (slightly simplified) code from this notebook that makes MathJax work correctly:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">markdown.inlinepatterns</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">HtmlPattern</span>

<p>The HtmlPattern class takes an expression and treats anything matching that expression as something that the markdown processor should not touch further.</p>


<p>Some caveats to note:</p>


<ul>
<li>Those brackets around the expression? Those are <em>important</em>. The way that the regular expression processing works is that it messes with your regex a bit, and then uses capturing group \(2\) as the output (\(1\) will be everything in the current block prior to the start of your regex). This means that if you must use groups in your regex, make them named groups.</li>
<li>For reasons I haven't fully understood and have chosen not to bother understanding because the current behaviour is correct for my needs, despite allegedly being an HTML block, this extension does seem to do entity escaping on the contents of your MathJax.</li>
</ul>

<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-08-30</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm going to start trying to port over some contents from <a href="https://github.com/DRMacIver/research-notebook">my research notebook</a> into here,
as this is intended long-term to be a replacement for it.
This will require some figuring out in terms of how to present maths.</p>


<p>As a starting point,
here's a theorem:</p>


<p>\(H(m) = \sum\limits_{q = 1}^m {(-1)}^{q - 1} {m \choose q} \frac{1}{q}\)</p>


<p>Where \(H(m)\) is the m'th harmonic number \(H(m) = \sum\limits_{i}^m \frac{1}{i}\).</p>


<p>This came up in "Birthday Paradox, Coupon Collectors, Caching Algorithms and Self-Organizing Search" by Flajolet et al. (which is excellent) where it was stated as "well known". It wasn't well known to <em>me</em>,
so I set out to prove it.</p>


<p>The following is my proof:</p>


<p>The main idea is to use a standard tricks of turning sums and integrals into other sums and integrals that happen to be easier to solve.
We use the following standard results:</p>


<ul>
<li>\(\frac{1}{n} = \int\limits_0^1 x^{n - 1}dx\)</li>
<li>\((1 + x)^m = \sum\limits_{q=1}^m {m \choose q} x^q\)</li>
<li>\((1 - x)^{-1} = \sum\limits_{q = 0}^\infty x^q\) for \(|x| &lt; 1\).</li>
</ul>


<p>We then perform the following manipulations (don't worry if some of these are clear as mud. They kinda should be):</p>


<p>\begin{align}
\sum\limits_{q = 1}^m {(-1)}^{q - 1} {m \choose q} \frac{1}{q} &amp;= \sum\limits_{q = 1}^m {(-1)}^{q - 1} {m \choose q} \int\limits_0^1 x^{q - 1} dx\\
&amp;= \int\limits_0^1 \sum\limits_{q = 1}^m {(-1)}^{q - 1} {m \choose q} x^{q - 1} dx\\
&amp;= \int\limits_0^1 -x^{-1} \sum\limits_{q = 1}^m {m \choose q} {(-x)}^q dx\\
&amp;= \int\limits_0^1 -x^{-1} \left( \sum\limits_{q = 0}^m {m \choose q} {(-x)}^q - 1 \right)dx \\
&amp;= \int\limits_0^1 -x^{-1} \left( {(1 - x)}^m - 1 \right)dx \\
&amp;= \int\limits_0^1 {(1 - x)}^{-1} (x^m - 1) dx \\
&amp;= \int\limits_0^1 \sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty x^n (x^m - 1) dx \\
&amp;= \sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty \int\limits_0^1 x^n (x^m - 1) \\
&amp;= \sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{n + m} - \frac{1}{n} \\
&amp;= \lim\limits_{k \to \infty}  H(m) - \sum\limits_{n = k}^{m + k} \frac{1}{n + m}\\
&amp;= H(m)\\
\end{align}</p>


<p>Notable magic tricks performed:</p>


<ul>
<li>\(\int\limits_0^1 -x^{-1} \left( {(1 - x)}^m - 1 \right)dx  \to \int\limits_0^1 {(1 - x)}^{-1} (x^m - 1) dx \) is a change of variables \(x \to 1 - x\).</li>
<li>\(\sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{1}{n + m} - \frac{1}{n} \to \lim\limits_{k \to \infty}  H(m) - \sum\limits_{n = k}^{m + k} \frac{1}{n + m}\) is because you can use a change of variables \(k \to k - m\),
and then group the terms that cancel out.</li>
<li>The final limit is because \(|\sum\limits_{n = k}^{m + k} \frac{1}{n + m}| \leq \frac{m}{k}\).</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a style of calculation I think of as the Feynmann style because <del>it's very good at seeming more clever than it actually is</del> he was fond of smugly boasting about using this sort of trick in preference to contour integration.
Given its prevalence prior to Feynmann, my only defence of the terminology is that it's not really intended as a compliment.</p>


<p>I find the Feynmann style completely unenlightening to read - the only way to read a Feynmann style proof is to do it yourself, using the original as a guide when you get stuck.</p>


<p>I think that's in some ways its point. It's not a proof technique designed to leverage enlightenment,
but instead it leans heavily on your puzzle solving skills. That can be useful sometimes when you just want to brute force your way through a problem and don't really care about understanding it on any sort of deeper level.</p>


<p>I was exposed to the Feynmann style quite early on,
due to reading Schaum's Outlines of Advanced Calculus (an earlier edition. I'm not sure how early. Brown covered one. I sadly gave away my copy, and the 1974 edition one I ordered doesn't seem to be quite it) prior to going to university.
It has quite a lot of exercises using calculations like this,
and afterwards I realised that this is what Feynmann had been talking about in "Surely you're joking, Mr Feynmann" (I didn't understand what a contour integral was until a few years later).</p>


<p>Somehow despite this the Feynmann style of brute force problem solving never really integrated into my mathematics,
and it's only some years later I've come to appreciate its merits.
I <em>still</em> prefer to achieve insight and make the problem trivial,
but sometimes the problem isn't worth the insight and you're better off just putting in the hard work and solving it.</p>


<p>Putting in the hard work is also useful because sometimes it leads you to the insight you missed and you can throw away most of the work.
This didn't happen here,
but I think that's OK - it's not that interesting a problem,
so I don't really feel upset by the lack of insight into it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on tiling with polyominoes</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2018-08-29</dd>
</dl>


<p>Gary Fredericks wrote about <a href="https://gfredericks.com/gfrlog/99">a backtracking algorithm for tiling a board with polyominoes</a>.</p>


<p>His solution is roughly "turn the problem into exact cover and then apply a bunch of interesting optimisations in this context to the naive backtracking algorithm".
The paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0011047.pdf">Dancing Links</a> by Donald E. Knuth in fact studies this exact problem as an application of the exact cover algorithm.</p>


<p>I think some of the optimisations Gary performs are not ones that would be performed by a modern SAT solver because they are actually too expensive to be worth it if you're good at the SAT problem-e.g.
I know modern SAT solvers tend not to bother decomposing problems into independent problems because the cost is too high-but
it's possible they synergise well enough to be worth it. e.g. the number theory optimisation combined with the independent components may well be worth it,
especially with the heuristic of prioritising moves that disconnect the board.</p>


<p>I've been doing a bit of casual reading about this class of problem recently.
I thought I'd use the opportunity of this new notebook to collect some references.
Ideally these would be proper cites,
but I haven't got the citation part of the notebook system working yet.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2307321.pdf">Checker Boards and Polyominoes</a> by Solomon W. Golomb is a classic here.
It looks at the question of tiling the chessboard with a single square monomino and 11 tetrominos of various shapes.
In particular it establishes:</p>


<ul>
<li>You can do this with right tetrominoes given any placement of the monomino</li>
<li>There are only four squares where you can place the monomino if you want to do it with straight tetrominoes.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://chalkdustmagazine.com/blog/polyominoes/">How to Tile a Chessboard</a> by Trupti Patel is a nice expository piece on this.</p>


<p>Golomb also wrote <a href="http://publisher-connector.core.ac.uk/resourcesync/data/elsevier/pdf/03f/aHR0cDovL2FwaS5lbHNldmllci5jb20vY29udGVudC9hcnRpY2xlL3BpaS9zMDAyMTk4MDA2NjgwMDMzOQ%3D%3D.pdf">Tiling with Polyominoes</a>,
studying much more general questions of how to tile truncated chessboards with polyominoes.</p>


<p>A classic version of this is what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilated_chessboard_problem">Wikipedia refers to as the mutilated chessboard problem</a> (apparently following Max Black):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Suppose a standard 8×8 chessboard has two diagonally opposite corners removed, leaving 62 squares. Is it possible to place 31 dominoes of size 2×1 so as to cover all of these squares?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The answer is no. In <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/07468342.2004.11922062">Tiling with Dominoes</a>, N. S. Mendelsohn discusses two proofs:</p>


<blockquote>
<h3>First solution</h3>
<p>From the checkerboard diagram, the region contains 30 black cells and 32 white cells.
Since each domino covers 1 black and 1 white cell, tiling is impossible.</p>
<h3>Second solution</h3>
<p>When I was first shown the problem many years ago, it did not occur to me to colour
the cells. The region itself had seven cells in the top and bottom rows and eight cells in
the remaining rows. The same held for the columns. I proceeded to obtain information
on how many dominoes pointed horizontally and how many vertically. The first count
dealt with the vertical dominoes. If the region is tiled, the horizontal dominoes in the
top row occupies an even number of cells. Hence, the cells in the top row that are not
occupied by horizontal dominoes are odd in number. Thus there are an odd number of
vertical dominoes between the first and second rows. Since the second row has eight
cells, and an odd number are occupied by vertical dominoes coming down from the
first row, there remain an odd number of cells in the second row. The same argument
now shows there is an odd number of vertical dominoes from the second row to the
third. Continuing this way, we see that there is an odd number of vertical dominoes
between any pair of consecutive rows. Hence the total number of vertical dominoes is
the sum of seven odd numbers, which is odd. In the same way, using columns instead
of rows, there is an odd number of horizontal dominoes. Hence the total number of
dominoes is even. Since there are 62 cells to cover, the number of dominoes required
is 31, an odd number. Therefore, tiling is impossible.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>He goes on to say:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Why do I produce two solutions to the puzzle? It is because I am interested in
the question of which is the better solution. At first glance, it appears that the first
solution is the better. It is much shorter and is easily understood by many people with
virtually no knowledge of mathematics. But are there considerations that might judge
the second solution to be the better one?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>He then discusses whether the second one is better because it generalises better,
when setting out to prove Gomory's theorem (which I've not been able to find a copy of the original of so far, but I haven't looked very hard):
If you remove two squares of the same colour, you can always tiling the remainder with dominoes.
The proof involves the construction of a hamiltonian circuit on the adjacency graph,
and seems fiddly but interesting.
I've only skimmed it and would like to digest it further.</p>


<p>However note that we saw a generalisation in a different direction in the first paper linked! Golomb's proof of the impossibility tiling with straight tetrominoes unless the monomino was in a very specific location was <em>also</em> a colouring argument.</p>


<p>The wikipedia page references "Across the board: the mathematics of chessboard problems" by John J. Watkins.
I should probably look up a copy.</p>

<p>This is an experimental new blog intended for notes, thoughts, and whatever else I want to put here.
It will likely be biased towards short notes rather than longform essays.
It's loosely inspired by <a href="https://shitpost.plover.com/">Mark Jason Dominus's shitposting blog</a> and by my frustrations with WordPress, but I'm not really sure where it's going yet. </p>


<p>It's also a place where I'll be experimenting with notation,
and generally trying to find a low friction way to express myself in a manner that I like.
As such it's all a bit cobbled together out of spit, bailing wire, and Python.</p>


<h3>Notational Highlights</h3>


<p>I kinda hate LaTeX, but it's the best typesetting language for mathematics that I know of,
so this notebook supports it using <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">mathjax</a>.</p>


<p>Testing: \(e^{i\pi} = -1\)</p>

<p>As you've probably noticed, I'm using <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">Tufte CSS</a>.
I'm not sure it's exactly what I want, but it's a lot closer to what I want than most other things I've tried.
I will likely be messing aroudn with this further.</p>


<p>I'm also using <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org">mako templates</a>,
and fully intend to define a metric tonne of macros to make this usable.</p>


<p>In general I expect the actual source code for this site to be totally unusable to anyone who is not me.
If anything,
if it's <em>not</em> then I probably haven't done enough customization for my brain.</p>
