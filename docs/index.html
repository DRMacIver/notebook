<p class="subtitle">Testing Positive For vs Having</p>

<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2A9stPS">Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences</a> by Bowker and Star, page 176:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>...it was decided that those who tested positive did not <em>have</em> [tuberculosis], they were "considered to have tuberculous infection but not the disease" (<em>Diagnosis</em> 1955, 15). Only those who could bring other evidence of disease to the table would be considered worthy of the classification of pulmonary or nonpulmonary tuberculosis.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is an interesting distinction. It reminds me of the distinction between HIV (the virus) and AIDS (the condition caused by the virus).</p>


<p>More generally, and tangentially, though I think we are seeing people becoming increasingly aware of the distinction between testing positive and having a disease in another way: You might test positive and just not have the disease. Equally, you might test negative and still have the disease.</p>


<p>I've written before in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/02/theres-no-single-error-rate/">There's no single error rate</a> about how you need to think about error quite carefully, and that for any classification scheme there is an error rate per possible answer. In this case you can incorrectly say that someone does not have the disease, and you can incorrectly say that they do.</p>


<p><a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2015897">This is a good article about the error rates in testing and what they mean</a> for diagnosis.</p>


<p>I know at least two people who have tested negative for COVID-19 but still seem pretty likely to have had it, due to symptoms and circumstances. That's not to say that you should <em>ignore</em> the fact that there's a negative result - it should certainly make you seem less likely to have it - but it's far from indisputable proof.</p>


<p>I think I'm pretty likely to have had it. I'm currently saying 90% likely (this is a made up number, but I'm pretty good - albeit far from perfect - at making up numbers to gauge my level of confidence).</p>


<p>So what would it mean if I got tested with an antibody test for whether I've had it?</p>


<p>Although I'm generally quite thumbs down on Bayesianism, this is an example where Bayes rule (well, conditional probability anyway) is obviously the correct thing to do as a way to reason about testing. If we make up more numbers and assume that the probability of a negative result given that I <em>am</em> infected is 10%, and the probability of a negative result given that I'm <em>not</em> infected is 95% (i.e. 5% of noninfected people will falsely get a positive result), then I assign 9% confidence to being infected and getting a negative result (90% chance I'm infected multiplied by 10% chance that if I'm infected I get a negative result) and a 9.5% chance that I'm not infected and get a negative result (90% chance of not infected, 95% chance that if I'm not infected I'll get a negative result), so for a total of 18.5% chance of a negative result.</p>


<p>Note that, because of my high prior confidence that I've been infected, it's almost as likely that I get a negative result but still have it as that I get a negative result and don't have it. Specifically, if I get a negative result the chances of my having it are \(100 \times \frac{9}{9 + 9.5} \approx 48.6\%\). i.e. despite the negative result I'm only barely more likely to not have it than I am to have it.</p>


<p>Does this mean that the tests are useless?</p>


<p>Well, maybe. Certainly a negative test result doesn't tell me much, but there's also not much I'd do with a negative test result anyway: A negative test result just means that I have to keep doing what I'm already doing, which is maintaining a sensible level of caution about catching the virus. Whether that's because I actually haven't had the virus, or whether it's because I've had the virus and the test wrongly reports that I have not, it doesn't really matter for my decision making - I've got no new information that would allow me to change behaviour.</p>


<p>A positive test result is potentially more useful. Suppose similar numbers: 90% of people with the virus test positive, and 5% of people without the virus test positive. After a positive result I'd be about 99% certain I'd had it, and thus that I was pretty likely immune.</p>


<p>I still wouldn't be <em>certain</em> that I had had the virus, or even that if I'd had the virus I would be immune, but behaviours that were previously unacceptable risks would now become acceptable risks.</p>


<p>This wouldn't change my behaviour much in that I'd just go out and start licking people, but it would change some of my risk profiles (I'm currently being significantly more careful than the government guidelines suggest, with one or two exceptions) and so I can use that to adjust my decisions.
I'd probably still keep away from supermarkets, but I'd probably be a lot more willing to hang out with friends outside.</p>


<p>Another use case is that even if tests are quite inaccurate at an individual level, they might be useful at a population level: If you know the false positive and false negative rates pretty well, and you implement mass testing, you can be pretty confident of the percentage of the population who have had the virus, and plan accordingly, even if you've got significant question marks about any individual person.</p>


<p>Ultimately I think this highlights two important things about knowledge:</p>


<ol>
<li>There is absolutely no certainty, only degrees of confidence (some of which may be so high that they might as well be certainty, but often you cannot wait until you are that certain).</li>
<li>The acceptable margins of uncertainty significantly depend on what you're going to do with the knowledge, and you'll often have to just be comfortable with the fact that you might be acting on wrong information.</li>
</ol>

<p class="subtitle">The Virtue Ethics of Potato Growing</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-05</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZB2wmE">Seeing Like a State</a> by James C. Scott, page 303:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>An explicit set of rules will take you further when the situation is cut-and-dried. The more static and one-dimensional the stereotype, the less the need for creative interpretation and adaptation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>If the environment can be simplified down to the point where the rules do explain a great deal, those who formulate the rules and techniques have also greatly expanded their power.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is all part of a rather interesting discussion of potato growing in the Andes, and about how the local growers are engaged in an extensive process of adapting cultivars to the particular soil and growing conditions of their farm ("landraces" - breeds that are highly adapted to a local environment). Rather than having a small number of legible potato breeds, they have hyperlocal varieties which are only found mostly on the farm they're grown on.</p>


<p>There is a great deal of swapping of these varieties and trying them out in different locations, so the line of any given type of potato is not restricted to the farm, but each farm will the interate on the potatoes it receives, crossing them, selecting them for new conditions, etc.</p>


<p>This is contrasted with the "scientific" mode of potato production, where a cultivar is selected for particular properties in ideal conditions, and <em>then</em> you find out where it grows well, and to some large degree try to make it so that the land matches the conditions (e.g. through irrigation, fertiliser) rather than trying to match the potato to the land.</p>


<p>Brief aside: I'd like to use this to point out a way that I, and others, have I think done James C. Scott in general and "Seeing Like a State" in particular a bit of a disservice. I've been on record in the past as saying that Seeing Like a State is much longer than it needs to be and that you can get most of the important information out of one of the relevant blog posts. <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/">Venkatesh Rao</a>'s, <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/11/shaping-the-world/">mine</a> or <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/">Scott Alexander</a>'s for example. This is in some sense true, but it's also in some sense false.</p>


<p>Seeing Like a State is not so much "too long" as "detail rich". If you're just interested in having the idea of legibility in your conceptual toolkit, it's too long and you should just read one of the blog posts. If you're interested in learning a lot of details about how the world works, both historically and geographically, it's about the right length, because it's packed with lots of these details, using legibility as a unifying theme and lens to look at them through.</p>


<p>Do you need to know about potato farming in the Andes to understand legibility? No, of course not. But potato farming in the Andes is, it turns out, <em>interesting</em>.</p>


<p>In an act of mild irony, casting "Seeing Like a State" as "the legibility book" is an attempt to make it more legible than the detail rich view on the ground would show it as.</p>


<p>Anyway, that being said, I'm going to return to the high level conceptual toolkit now.</p>


<p>I've been reading Rosalind Hursthouse's <a href="https://amzn.to/3dyWLu8">On Virtue Ethics</a>. It's excellent and I highly recommend it. I'm currently doing a <a href="https://jmestn.com/15485/naval-doesn-t-take-notes">high level first pass read</a> so I can't necessarily fairly summarise it, but one of the things I like about Virtue Ethics in general is its emphasis on becoming the sort of person who takes good actions over and above teasing out the right thing to do in any individual action, trying to come up with some sort of schema or set of rules.</p>


<p>In particular, it feels like a lot of attempts to understand ethical reasoning try to pin down things into exactly these cut and dried scenarios so that you can say "Look, here's a rule that works!".</p>


<p>Teasing out these scenarios itself isn't necessarily bad in that it can be useful for understanding what traits lead to good decisions, and what those good decisions look like, but they inevitably come with some fairly massive simplifying assumptions. For example, trolley problems work precisely by narrowing the field down until you <em>have</em> to pick one of two unpalatable options.</p>


<p>That being said, even these situations fail to make the world as simple as they'd like. I've previously proposed that the solution to trolley problems is relatively easy if you allow the possibility of incurring guilt for doing the "right" thing. If you kill the individual to save the many, you still have to deal with (at least some of) the consequences of killing the individual.</p>


<p>In general, I think, one of the high points of virtue ethics is that it is good at acknowledging that although you can reason about ethics, a lot of actual ethical behaviour has to come down to the person dealing with the messy situation on the ground, and that this problem is contiguous with practical reasoning (virtue ethicists use the word "Phronesis", meaning a sort of practical wisdom oriented around getting morally good result). Virtue ethical reasoning very much resembles the sort of messy practical reasoning that people engage in in practice with problem solving.</p>


<p>One of the interesting things in the section about potatoes is how even the idealised scientific tools get folded in to the messy practical realities of making the world work for the farmer:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[...] the vast majority of Andean cultivators are neither purely traditional cultivators nor mindless followers of the scientific specialists. They are, instead, crafting unique alamagams of strategies that reflect their ams, their resources, and their local conditions. Where the new potatoes seem to fit their purposes, they may plant some, but they may interplant them with other cultivars and may substitute dung, or plow in green manure (alfalfa, clover) rather than apply the standard fertilizer package.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The practice of scientific development of potatoes is very good for optimising for things that you would not necessarily find in the wild. Essentially it's the output of a bunch of potato <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">nerds</a> and we can always learn interesting things from nerds we wouldn't otherwise have encountered. But when we take the nice, idealised, potato and bring it into the real world, we find out all sorts of ways it doesn't fit, or where it's a bit precious, and we learn to adapt it as such.</p>


<p>I wrote before in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-10-08:54.html">How to be a better person</a> that we need a practice of ethics more than a theory of ethics, but the theory of ethics stuff is good too, we just may need to heavily adapt it as we bring it into the real world of practical decision making. Possibly by substituting dung instead of its standard fertilizer package.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Popular Culture Reference, David</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-04</dd>
</dl>


<p>(A quick post today, due to needing to get on with other things very shortly)</p>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2yzEkGq">How to talk about books you haven't read</a> by Pierre Bayard, page 61:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The most common literary confrontations are those that occur in our social lives, and of these the most vexing are those in which we are expected to express ourselves in front of a group. On such occasions, the conversation may turn to a book we have not read. If the book in question is assumed to be known by all cultivated individuals [...]</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The thing that struck me about this is how much it doesn't happen to me. I don't think I have ever had a conversation in which someone is surprised that I haven't read a particular book, except very occasionally as a joke because they assume I've read everything. I can't think of any examples of books that have that level of cultural penetration among people I know.</p>


<p>Most of this is probably a difference between me and Pierre Bayard - he's coming from a French literary scene. His friends' notion of "all cultivated individuals" probably doesn't include me or my friends.</p>


<p>He's also quite a lot older than me, and my suspicion is that he's describing an event that is genuinely less common these days, because instead our shared cultural objects seem mostly to be TV shows and movies.
And there I get that a lot. It's a running joke: "Popular culture reference, David, you wouldn't understand."</p>


<p>This is not, I hasten to add, because I'm too classy for TV and movies. Movies don't really work well for me as a format, but I do watch a lot of TV, most of it not very good. I just skip out on a lot of mainstream stuff because it doesn't work well for me (for example I cannot stand embarassment based humour and have no interest in watching things that make me whole body cringe).</p>


<p>I'm generally OK just saying that I haven't watched it. This does, often, result in a bunch of pressure to watch things. "You absolutely must watch it! It's amazing!" is somehow perfectly socially acceptable, despite a single season of a TV show probably being at least twelve hours of watching, but people get edgy and defensive when I recommend books to them.</p>


<p>I understand why this is. It's easy to find twelve hours to watch TV, it's hard to find five hours to read a book, because the latter requires focus and causes people to confront all sorts of unpleasant emotions about their relationship with reading, while the former allows them to palliate by fast-forwarding their brain through those twelve hours.</p>


<p>(There's nothing wrong with doing that if that's what you want to do, but I think people are kidding themselves about this)</p>


<p>I think in some ways TV shows also just work better as a shared cultural object than books, because there are so many fewer of them. It's very expensive to produce a TV show. It's not cheap to produce a book, but it's cheap enough that there are several orders of magnitude more books than TV shows. Even best sellers rarely have the penetration of a moderately popular TV show (with a few outliers like Harry Potter).</p>


<p>Unfortunately creating sharedness of our cultural objects by making them expensive to produce isn't so great. It creates a very high barrier to entry on whose voices become part of our shared culture, and it creates an incentive to make it accessible to as broad an audience as possible. It prioritises relatable over insightful.</p>


<p>That's not to say that TV shows are necessarily <em>bad</em> shared cultural objects. There are some very good ones. I'm genuinely very grateful to The Good Place for existing. Trigonometry (which I still need to finish watching) is some great representation.</p>


<p>I'm not going to say Stargate is a <em>good</em> shared cultural object (or, frankly, a particularly shared one - it's not unpopular by any means given how long it ran for, but it's not something I can reasonably <em>expect</em> people to have watched), but I still like it and will enjoy talking Stargate with people.</p>


<p>But it does leave a popular culture that is strangely anemic. Fandom fills in the gaps, fleshing out the world of shared culture with the voices it lacks. Fandom is its own popular culture, building a richer world on top of the shared cultural objects provided to us. It is, however, a relatively niche thing that most people don't seem aware of or participate in - I'm only on the outskirts of it myself, and I don't really know how I would go about participating more deeply (or whether I want to).</p>


<p>I don't really have any closing thoughts, except that it'd actually be quite nice to have a group where there was a shared canon of books that actually I <em>could</em> assume everyone in that group had read.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Some Useful Emotion Management Principles</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-03</dd>
</dl>


<p>I was talking about anxiety management a bit on Twitter, and it occurred to me that it would be useful to write down a bunch of general principles that I use for understanding emotions.</p>


<p>These principles aren't necessarily <em>true</em>, but I've found them useful. I'd say that they're probably... about 90% true. They're worth using as defaults for understanding things, but they probably have some hidden preconditions and missing features that I have not fully mapped out yet.</p>


<ol>
<li>One of the primary features of emotions is a disposition to act in a particular way.</li>
<li>A disposition to act is not an obligation to act.</li>
<li>These dispositions are experienced, at least in large part, through your body, so paying attention to your body helps you understand your emotions.</li>
<li>There are no "bad" emotions, in the sense that there always a situation where the disposition prompted by the emotion would be appropriate.</li>
<li>In a given context, an emotional reaction may or may not be appropriate.</li>
<li>Emotional reactions are learned pattern matching in response to particular events.</li>
<li>When an emotional reaction is active, you can retrain those patterns into ones that better suit the situation.</li>
<li>Retraining requires you to acknowledge that the emotion might, in principle, be a valid reaction in context.</li>
<li>If you ignore an emotion, it will tend to increase in intensity to get you to act on it.</li>
<li>Learning to act competently on dispositions can improve emotional experiences.</li>
<li>If an emotion is debilitating or otherwise interferes with your life, that's often a sign of some sort of dysregulation in how you are managing it.</li>
</ol>


<p>Let me unpack each of these.</p>


<h3>Emotions as dispositions towards action</h3>


<p>A disposition in this context is an inclination towards a certain class of things, an inclination to act in a particular way.</p>


<p>When you are angry, it is because you are being prompted to act angrily. You are getting ready to have a fight, and you are orienting yourself towards actions that are useful for that.</p>


<p>Some people (e.g. Antonio Damasio I think) argue that emotions <em>are</em> these dispositions. I'm somewhat agnostic on this question, in that I think our use of the word "emotion" is variable enough that it's not clear to me that "What are emotions?" is a well-defined question, and any attempt to promote it as a definition is probably a lost cause.
However, regardless of what theory of emotion we end up with, understanding the dispositions associated with an emotion is key to understanding that emotion.</p>


<p>Here are some other examples of disposition:</p>


<ul>
<li>Anxiety might dispose you to reducing the uncertainty in a situation.</li>
<li>Fear might dispose you to getting out of a situation.</li>
<li>Guilt might dispose you towards repairing some damage you've done.</li>
<li>Curiousity might dispose you to learning more about something.</li>
<li>Contentment might dispose you towards luxuriating in something you're enjoying.</li>
<li>Delight might dispose you towards immersing yourself in a particular activity.</li>
</ul>


<p>(Side note: I realised while writing this that it was much easier for me to figure out what the dispositions associated with negative emotions are. Given that part of my goals right now are to improve my experience of positive emotions, I find that very interesting)</p>


<h3>Dispositions are not obligations</h3>


<p>When you get angry, you are not being <em>forced</em> to act angrily. You can feel angry without acting angry (although people will probably be able to tell that you are angry. This is not necessarily bad). But the emotion of anger includes, as a key feature, a dsposition towards angry action - you are inclined to shout at someone, to attack them, etc.</p>


<p>An important skill in emotion management is to acquire a bit of a separation between disposition and action. To pause and say "Actually, I know that emotionally this is the way I am disposed to act, but <em>should</em> I do that?"</p>


<p>Importantly, this is not <em>suppressing</em> the emotion. That has to be an honest question, to which it is possible that the answer is allowed to be yes.</p>


<h3>Dispositions are experienced bodily</h3>


<p>We act in the world through our body, so experiencing a disposition is, in large part, experiencing an arrangement of our body (including our senses) to act. If we are disposed to fight, we will feel our body tensing to fight. If we are curious about something, we might feel our attention physically drawn to it.</p>


<p>Learning this is basically what <a href="https://focusing.org/">Focusing</a> is - learning to pay attention to your bodily dispositions towards particular actions, as a preliminary step towards understanding the emotional reactions that underly them.</p>


<h3>There are no bad emotions</h3>


<p>We have these dispositions because <em>they are useful</em>. If you are experiencing a disposition, there are circumstances under which that disposition is the right one. If you feel afraid, that is not bad in and of itself, because there are circumstances under which a disposition to get out of the situation is a good thing.</p>


<p>We (for some suitably culture specific value of we) tend to think of negative emotions as being bad for a couple of reasons:</p>


<ul>
<li>They might frequently be inappropriately deployed (anger).</li>
<li>They might be overused, or misused, against us (guilt, shame)</li>
<li>We might have unhelpful habits built up around them (anxiety)</li>
</ul>


<p>These all give us a bad relationship with a particular emotion, but they primarily result in a conflation between the disposition, the situation prompting it, and the actions it prompts. The disposition <em>in and of itself</em> is neither bad nor good, and sometimes it will be exactly the right thing to have.</p>


<h3>Emotions may promote inappropriate action</h3>


<p>Suppose you say something, and I mishear you and think you have insulted at me, and I respond in kind, and a fight results. That is an example of an inappropriate reaction - I have misunderstood the situation, I have acted in a way that is (arguably) appropriate <em>if the situation were as I understood it</em>.</p>


<p>This is what an inappropriate emotional reaction is like: You have responded with a disposition because the situation makes you think it is the appropriate one, but you are in some way mistaken about the situation.</p>


<h3>Emotional reactions are learned pattern-matching</h3>


<p>Generally your emotional reactions are based on very simplified models of the world.
For example, social anxiety might be a learned reaction that <em>all</em> social situations are unsafe and you have to be on high alert and monitor for threats. A bad experience with men might cause a disposition to be on your guard around <em>all</em> men.</p>


<p>You don't necessarily have access to these simplified models. There's not necessarily a conscious part of your brain that goes "This is a party. Parties are THE WORST. Therefore I now decide to be anxious." - the anxiety generally starts preverbally, and the thoughts come after (although the thoughts can in turn promote action).</p>


<p>It can be useful to think of your mind having a subsystem that is "the bit that decides to be anxious" (or angry, or delighted, or...) which is monitoring the world for certain features and putting you into the particular disposition when its conditions are met. The subsystem is not necessarily particularly intelligent, and you have a lot of these subsystems going on so they don't necessarily have a lot of resources available to them, so they're trying to do the best they can on a limited budget, and they sometimes get it wrong.</p>


<h3>Active emotional reactions can be relearned</h3>


<p>Because emotions are learned pattern matching, changing your emotional reactions is a matter of relearning that pattern matching. You want to take the subsystem and get it to respond better in some circumstances.</p>


<p>This seems to be <em>much</em> easier when the emotional subsystem is activated. I don't want to say you <em>can't</em> do it when it's not activated (and certainly you can lay useful groundwork for this process), but it's not something I've been able to do.</p>


<p>"Activated" doesn't necessarily mean when you're in the situation in question (although I do often use it there) - it can through a process of imagination, talking it out, thinking about the prompting situation.</p>


<p>Once you're in this state, you can gently start to question the premises of the emotional reaction. Draw your attention to certain aspects of the situation, explore whether this is the right disposition for you to take in this context.</p>


<p>For example, social anxiety can be relearned around people you have much stronger evidence are safe. The level of anxiety you experience when talking to a close friend should be lower than the level of anxiety you have talking to someone at a party, and drawing your attention to the things that make it so can help relearn the emotional reaction.</p>


<h3>Ignoring an emotion intensifies it</h3>


<p>One thing that <em>doesn't</em> seem to work is to try to suppress and ignore the emotion.
Emotions are there to dispose you to act, so will often rise to the level of intensity required to get you to act.
If you repeatedly suppress an emotion and pretend it's not there,
it will tend to get worse over time rather than better.</p>


<h3>Relearning starts with accepting the emotion in principle</h3>


<p>Because ignoring the emotion doesn't work, and because emotions are dispositions to act,
you need to acknowledge it as potentially valid.</p>


<p>What this means is that you need to start from the premise that if this is the correct disposition to have in this scenario, you would act on it. If you're actually being attacked, it's OK to be angry and act angrily. If there's genuine risk in the situation, it's OK to be anxious and act to reduce that risk.</p>


<p>Starting from the premise that the emotion <em>might</em> be valid, and exploring the question of whether it is, allows you to work with yourself rather than creating internal conflict, and maximises your chance of successfully retraining the emotion.</p>


<h3>Learning to act competently on dispositions</h3>


<p>One of the big problems we often end up with emotions is that we're not very good at acting on them not in the sense that we ignore them, but we act on them in ways that don't actually improve the situation.</p>


<p>Anxiety and guilt are two big examples of this. If anxiety causes us to panic and make the situation worse, we have <em>not</em> reduced the risk in the situation, so our level of anxiety goes up rather down. If we feel guilty and avoid the whole situation to avoid feeling that guilt, we end up feeling more guilty rather than less.</p>


<p>Learning skills in a safe environment (when the emotion is <em>not</em> active) that we can apply in these cases helps us fix this: If cleaning makes us anxious, creating a safe environment in which to learn a bit of cleaning skills will help the next time we have cleaning anxiety. If we feel guilt about a particular situation, talking through the situation and deciding on some practical steps you can take to improve it (or indeed deciding that you don't need to feel guilty about it at all).</p>


<p>The ideal situation is that we have the emotional responses that dispose us to act in the right way in the right context, and learning to act in the right way is a key part of that that we can manage separately from the emotional responses themselves.</p>


<h3>Debilitating emotions are probably dysregulation</h3>


<p>If your emotional reactions are so strong that they prevent you from acting, something has gone wrong (except in the rare specific cases where preventing you from acting is what they're <em>supposed</em> to do, as in the freeze trauma response). Emotions are dispositions towards actions, but if those dispositions get too overwhelmingly intense they may stop you from acting.</p>


<p>I don't have too much experience with this side of things (my problems are, if anything, at the opposite end of the spectrum - I don't tend to have intense enough emotional reactions), so I'm wary of offering too much advice in this space. I think all of the above principles are still likely to be useful to you, but I'd recommend also looking into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectical_behavior_therapy">Dialectical Behavioural Therapy</a> and possibly the literature on cPTSD. <a href="https://www.rewriting-the-rules.com/self/trauma-and-cptsd-101/">Meg-John Barker's piece on the subject</a> is good, and provides pointers to further literatures.</p>


<p>(The literature on cPTSD may also be useful even if you <em>don't</em> experience overwhelming emotions. Certainly I've found it so.)</p>


<h3>Further Reading</h3>


<p>These are the principles underlying most of my emotion work right now. You can read some more of my thoughts on the subject in:</p>

<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-20-17:58.html">How I fix anxiety triggers</a></li>
</ul>


<p>If you'd like to read more qualified people's thoughts on the subject the books I've read that are most directly relevant to this are:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2AUQ2vW">Descartes' Error</a> by Antonio Damasio is largely theoretical but is good for understanding the mind/body link.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Mnm1Hx">Focusing</a> by Eugene Gendlin helps understand how to use a sense of your own body to understand your emotions. People recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/3gMG3cB">The Power of Focusing</a> as a better introduction but I haven't got around to reading it yet.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3gQUdcT">Unlocking the emotional brain</a> is in theory the source of a lot of my work on retraining emotions, but I must admit I never get around to reading it. I just read <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/book-summary-unlocking-the-emotional-brain">Kaj Sotala's review of it</a>, went "Oh right", and immediately incorporated it into my own practice.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2Axf1W0">The Emotion Machine</a> by Marvin Minsky was useful for thinking about how the mind organises itself around resources which create dispositions to action. I'm suspicious of whether the book is actually <em>right</em>, but it's proven a useful source of metaphors.</li>
</ul>


<p>I can't necessarily promise you'll get the same things out of these resources that I did - there's a lot of surrounding additional reading, discussion, and experimentation, but they're all good books that I've found quite helpful.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Being friends with your coworkers</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew">Talking About Machines</a> by Julian Orr, page 35:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>their [team] has developed personal bonds in addition to their professional association, including friendship outside the job. His narration reveals a division among technicians over the propriety of such bonds, and while he clearly values them, he is wary of revealing them to me.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The question of whether you should be friends with your coworkers is an interesting one.
For me the answer is "Obviously yes, except it's kinda problematic."</p>


<p>At a personal level, being friends with your coworkers is good. You're going to spend a <em>lot</em> of your time together, and your life will be improved if you actually like spending time together.</p>


<p>At a professional level, being friends with your coworkers is also good: It significantly improves your team productivity. One of the things that is clear from Orr's book is that talking to each other, swapping war stories, sharing technical problems and advice, is almost inseparable from having a friendly conversation with each other. This isn't the equivalent of having a daily standup or a team meeting, it's a conversation, and it's much easier to have conversations with your friends. These conversations are an essential part of learning together and sharing important information.</p>


<p>Being friends with your coworkers makes literally everything better, and it is very hard to have a functioning company without a certain amount of bonds of friendship.</p>


<p>Also... this is how marginalisation works and reinforces itself, because not everybody can easily be friends with their coworkers.</p>


<p>I'm reminded of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/da6a33be-bd8f-11e8-8274-55b72926558f">this piece from the FT</a> (apologies for the paywall):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This was an instant, if brutal, reminder of the value of smoking at work. It is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of finding out what is really going on in the office. </p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>I am indebted to a reader for my favourite ploy: an office beer fridge. A man from the US who has started and managed several companies wrote to tell me on-site grog had several proven benefits. Everyone got to know each other quickly, he said, “from production worker to the CEO”, and that made a big difference to the way they worked with one another.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>These sorts of nonwork activities that promote socialisation end up being extremely good for establishing lines of information and common knowledge within the company that run orthogonally to formal lines of information.</p>


<p>Also, both smoking and drinking are hugely exclusionary ways of setting up those lines, right? They're <em>effective</em>, but they're effective for the people who are willing to participate them. Personally, I don't mind office drinking (but no thanks on the beer), and will find the presence of smokers around the office actively unpleasant, never mind <em>joining</em> them.</p>


<p>Many people have had bad experiences with alcohol, or avoid it for religious reasons, and above and beyond not drinking will not be at all comfortable around people who are drinking. It also tends to exacerbate other ways in which a group is exclusionary - if you're part of an underrepresented minority, people who are on their best behaviour while sober may start to show their true colours while drunk (and even if it turns out that their true colours are actually that they're perfectly nice people and there are zero problems, it's hard to know that in advance and this prevents the event from being relaxing and enjoyable).</p>


<p>There is a lot of criticism of the tech industry's reliance on alcohol for social bonding on grounds of it being exclusionary, and this criticism is entirely correct.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, the criticism tends not to get listened to, for one very simple reason: Drinking as a way of socialising works really well, and without something to replace it, this criticism asks the majority to make a significant personal sacrifice for the minority's comfort. This doesn't tend to go well. Should the majority do it? Well, maybe. But you need to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-19-09:35.html">work with the audience that you have</a>.</p>


<p>Even if you overcome this and find a perfectly innocuous way of doing team socialisation,
you end up with issues of conflicting identity.</p>


<p>I was at a London <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a> meetup group right before lockdown started, and someone there suggested that on Mondays they tried to get a lot of discussion going between people about what they'd done over their weekend, as a kind of ice breaker / social bonding exercise.</p>


<p>I gently suggested to them that this might not work so well because you're trying to force people to disclose things they may not want to disclose. People don't generally want to tell their coworkers that they spent the weekend at a sex party (this is a common problem among my friend group).</p>


<p>It doesn't have to be a sex party either. People are probably equally unwilling to tell their staunchly atheist coworkers that they spent the weekend at a bible study. Telling people that they spent their weekend at a protest risks office politics.</p>


<p>More innocuously, you have a divide between parents and non parents. If a parent talks about how they spent their weekend with their kids, the other parents in the room may join in talking about their kids, while the non-parents sit there twiddling their thumbs. Or, equally, if you're the only parent in the room and everyone is talking about the fun things they were up to this weekend and you were mostly doing childcare duties.</p>


<p>I think part of the problem here is that we are too used to playing friendship on easy mode and largely lack the skill of having heterogenous friends groups. It's much easier to be friends if you can find strong points of commonality with each other and minimise points of conflict. When your main point of commonality is that you work together, you will often lack that easy mode.</p>


<p>The problem gets worse when you take into account that some people actually just may not be able to make friends that easily. They may be lacking in social skills, or they may just be kinda traumatised and find it difficult to trust people. Many of these people are lovely, brilliant, people, and even those who aren't probably need to work <em>somewhere</em> - because, alas, capitalism. How do we make a system that works for them?</p>


<p>Also, when you try to deliberately help those people integrate, this may seem like an attack on them, because it reads like a social test that they can fail.</p>


<p>All of these problems are, I think, even worse at a small company. I wrote about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-25-10:40.html">the problem with not fitting in in small towns</a> before, and small companies are like that but more so. If you work in an office with a thousand other people there are probably others like you there (whether you can find them is another issue). That doesn't necessarily solve your problem if you're not on their team, but it at least <em>helps</em>. If you work at a company of five other people, chances are good that you have a number of traits that are unique to you, and some of those may be ones that result in you being excluded.</p>


<p>It is at this point that I reveal the easy, brilliant, and obvious solution that will solve all of these problems.</p>


<p>Err.</p>


<p>Maybe it's not. I was kinda hoping you would do that for me. Because this problem seems like a giant insoluble mess and I barely have any idea where to start - any solution seems far too contextual for me to propose any general principles.</p>


<p>Mostly I'd like people to start by acknowledging the problem: Being friends with your coworkers is important and valuable, and currently we only make it accessible to people who get to play friendship on easy mode.</p>
