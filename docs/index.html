<p class="subtitle">Book speedrun: On Humour by Simon Critchley</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>Lucy Keer has a thing she does called <a href="https://drossbucket.com/2021/09/17/research-speedruns/">Research Speedruns</a> where she sets a timer for an hour and learns everything she can about a topic during that time, writing as she goes. I've liked the idea for a while but rarely have this sort of problem where there's a topic I want to speedrun finding out about, but I do have a lot of books that I'd like to delve more deeply into (usually ones I've done a first pass on) and an intention to write more, so I thought I'd try a similar experiment of doing book speedruns.</p>


<p>The basic plan is to just write about the book for an hour in whatever mode takes me. A lot of it will be about random prompts from the book, some of it will be non-random thoughts on the book. It won't necessarily hang together in any especially coherent way. In particular it's not a book review, it's just thoughts inspired by the book.</p>


<p>The book I'll be speedrunning to start with is "On Humour" by Simon Critchely. It's a book about philosophy of humour that I found because Critchley was mentioned in Carr and Greeve's book about humour "The Naked Jape". It's short and I've read it in full, but at the time I didn't feel like I got a great deal out of it. It was locally interesting, but I didn't feel like I really changed my thinking based on it at all, so I thought it would be good to see if a speedrun could help with that.</p>


<h3>Structured Fun</h3>


<p>From page 12:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Humour is being employed as a management tool by consultants - imagine, if you will, a company called 'Humour Solutions International' - who endeavour to show how it can produce greater cohesion amongst the workforce and thereby increase efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>...it is difficult not to feel a little cynical about these endeavours, and the question that one wants to pose to the idea of 'structured fun' is: who is structure the fun and for what end?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I must admit I've never run into this, and I'm very thankful for that because it probably wouldn't have gone well for me.</p>


<p>I have a couple objections to this sort of structured fun use of humour. I guess the morally strongest of them is the one that Critchley goes on to mention, which is that it's a tool of control by management, and trying to impose humour on people is interfering with their private lives.</p>


<p>It also reminds me of the whole problem of corporate mindfulness. One of the virtues of humour is that it helps cope with a bad situation, but when that virtue is being touted by people responsible for that bad situation, that seems intrinsically problematic.</p>


<p>I must admit though my true objection is that I bet such corporate workshops are painfully unfunny.
I have a real aversion to people trying too hard to be funny and falling short.</p>


<p>I am in fact interested in humour partly for its benefits to organisations, and as a communal practice among workers, but I can't help but think that any attempt to impose that from above is likely to do more harm than good.</p>


<h3>Humour's us</h3>


<p>From page 73:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>So, humour is what returns us to our locale, to a specific <em>ethos</em> which is often identified with a particular people possessing a shared set of customs and characteristics. A sense of humour is often what is felt to be best shared with people who are from the same place as us, and it is that aspect of social life which is perhaps the most difficult to explain to people from somewhere else.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In context this is talking about literal places - countries, villages, etc. But I do think this is more general - in "Jokes: Philosophical Reflections on Joking Matters", Ted Cohen talks about how contextual humour is - there is always an audience of people for whom the joke is intended - and talks about <em>hermetic jokes</em> which are those that you have to be part of a specific profession to get. I think humour can return us to a parochial "place" within their profession as well as their country. There are very much the sorts of jokes you tell as engineers, etc.</p>


<p>A shared sense of humour with someone is how you know they are "one of us", and helps define what that "us" is.</p>


<p>This ties back in to the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-04-12:52.html">humour test for expertise</a>, but in a very broad sense of expertise. Getting the national sense of humour is often how you know you're a native, fluent in the local culture.</p>


<h3>Humour's them</h3>


<p>From page 76:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>jokes can be read in terms of what or who a particular society is subordinating, scapegoating, or denigrating.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The fact of the matter is that a lot of humour is about people you look down on. In context, Critchley is talking about anti-semitism and other racist jokes, and what they say about our subconscious feelings that we are repressing (though of course they can equally say things about the conscious things that we are expressing).</p>


<p>I can't help but tie this back to a bit from the structured fun section. From page 14:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who has worked in a factory or office knows how the most scurrilous and usually obscene stories, songs and cartoons about the management are the very bread and butter of survival. Humour might well be a management tool but it is also a tool against the management.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is of course very different from the case of racist jokes, in that it is humour against those with power rather than those who are marginalised (punching up vs punching down, if you must).</p>


<p>Nevertheless, the jokes do have one common function: They are very clearly delineating the line of us vs them. If "us" is the group of people we laugh <em>with</em>, then "them" are the group of people we laugh <em>about</em>.</p>


<p>Whether this us and them division is bad is hard to comment on in generality - it seems like it's clearly sometimes bad and clearly sometimes a necessary coping mechanism.
e.g. you can tell how politics is going by how Soviet the jokes get.</p>


<p>I can't find the original source of this joke but it's been doing the rounds recently:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Boris Johnson visited a village in Cornwall and asked the inhabitants what the government could do for them.</p>
<p>"We have two big needs" said the village spokesman. "The first is we have a health centre but no doctor."</p>
<p>Boris whipped out his phone, talked for a while then said, "OK, =that's sorted, you'll have a doctor here tomorrow. Now, what was your other need?"</p>
<p>"Well, we have no mobile reception at all in our village."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Yeah, so that's how our politics is going.</p>


<p>While I have you here, here's a joke from page 21 of "Forbidden Laughter (Soviet Underground Jokes)".</p>


<blockquote>
<p>An old woman ran with all her might to catch the jam-packed city bus. "Thank God!" she sighed, having made it.</p>
<p>A citizen sitting next to her said: "You expressed that improperly, auntie. You should know that there is no God. You should have said 'Thank Stalin'."
"You're right, son, you're right," said the old woman in agreement. "Excuse me, I'm a little behind the times."</p>
<p>But after thinking awhile, the old woman asked:</p>
<p>"God forbid this should happen, but what am I supposed to say if Stalin should die?"</p>
<p>"In that case, perhaps you may say 'Thank God'."</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Well you've got to laugh about it</h3>


<p>Page 101 has a section called "Humour as an antidepressant". His approach to this is very Freudian and I'm not sure I fully follow his argument, but on page 102 he declares:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I would argue that humour recalls to us the modesty and limitedness of the human condition, a limitedness that calls not only for tragic-heroic affirmation but comic <em>acknowledgement</em>, not Promethean authencity but a laughable inauthenticity."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I recently finished reading John Marmysz's "Laughing at Nothing: Humour as a response to nihilism", which argues that nihilism can be viewed as a conjunction of three things:</p>


<ol>
<li>Humanity is alienated from perfection (true meaning, perfect goodness, etc)</li>
<li>This is other than it should be.</li>
<li>This situation cannot be remedied.</li>
</ol>


<p>The book was a (ultimately somewhat unconvincing, though I enjoyed it anyway) argument that instead of, as nihilists traditionally do, regarding that combination as tragic, we can regard it as comedic, laughing at the incongruity.</p>


<p>Critchley's argument that humour acts as an antidepressant by reminding us of "the modesty and limitedness of the human condition" feels similar. We take the tragic and attempt to find it funny, perhaps by putting it into perspective.</p>


<p>This seems to tie in to the laughing at the people with power over you. That power exists and is other than it should be, but we can find it funny as well as oppressive.</p>


<p>At the end of the book, on page 111, Critchley recounts an extract from a French city that had been bombed in world war 2 and the concludes the book:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>For me, it is this smile - deriding the having and the not having, the pleasure and the pain, the sublimiity and suffering of the human situation - that is the essence of humour. This is the <em>risus purus</em>, the highest laugh, the laugh that laughs at that which is unhappy, the mirthless laugh of the epigraph of this book. Yet, this smile does not bring unhappiness, but rather elevation and liberation, the lucidity of consolation. This is why, melancholy animals that we are, human beings are also the most cheerful. We smile and find ourselves ridiclous. Our wretchedness is our greatness.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The epigraph in question is the following:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The bitter, the hollow and - haw! haw! - the mirthless. The bitter laugh laughs at that which is not good, it is the ethical laugh. The holow laugh laughs at that which is not true, it is the intellectual laugh. Not good! Not true! Well, well. But the mirthless laugh is the dianoetic laugh, down the snout - haw! - so. It is the laugh of laughs, the <em>risusu purus</em>, the laugh laughing at the laugh, the beholding, the saluting of the highest joke, in a word the laugh that laughs - silence please - at that which is unhappy.</p>
<p>Samuel Becket, <strong>Watt</strong></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Hey Critchley, what's yellow and equivalent to the axiom of choice? Zorn's Lemon.</p>


<p>Try finding some misery in that joke, gloomy guts.</p>


<p>As you can tell, I'm starting to lose a bit of patience with Critchley. If humour is, as he claims, an antidepressant, why is his book on humour coming across so morbid?</p>


<p>There is, I think, a thing that happens with a lot of philosophy of humour where you're supposed to make what is ultimately a light hearted subject very serious, and the easiest way to do that seems to be to ground it in human misery. Humour is cruel, humour is exclusionary, humour is a coping mechanism for the intrinsic misery of the human condition, etc.</p>


<p>All of this is true, but I do think it misses one of the most important features of humour, which is that humour is <em>funny</em>, and in being funny is fun.</p>


<p>I think this is me being a little unfair to Critchley and is in part a consequence of the thread I pulled on with these samples so far, but I do think there is a significant undercurrent of this in the book, and the epigraph and conclusion very much highlight that.</p>


<h3>Only as good as its jokes</h3>


<p>From page 66:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Any study of humour, again like anthropology, requires fieldwork and detailed contextualisation. Finally, it is only as good as its examples.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As I mentioned above, I recently finished reading "The Naked Jape". It's not an amazing book, but it's a lot of fun to read, and one of its virtues is that it has a joke at the bottom of every page.</p>


<p>I'm particularly fond of the following:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Two nuns are driving through Transylvania when Count Dracula suddenly jumps on their car. "Quick, show him your cross" says one of the nuns. The other nun shouts, "Hey, Dracula! Fuck off!"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/rikkhill/status/1432051001264156674">Previously introduced to me by Rikk Hill</a>)</p>


<p>And I think the difference between this and On Humour is telling. A study of humour might only be as good as its examples, but a book of philosophy of humour is only as good as its jokes, and honestly the jokes in On Humour aren't very good. There are a few that raised a smile (The chapter on humour of the body is entitled "Post-Colonal Theory", and I must admit that's a good one), but the book takes itself more seriously than I think is warranted, and some better jokes might have helped offset that.</p>


<h3>In Conclusion</h3>


<p>I'm sortof surprised by how this went, as I thought I liked the book, but I apparently have some quite negative feelings about it that I hadn't noticed before.</p>


<p>I liked doing a speedrun based on it, but I don't really feel like it gave the book a fair showing. Its was more like pulling on an interesting thread of the book, and that thread was certainly there in the book, but I don't think it was the whole of the book.</p>


<p>It might be worth returning to it later and doing another run through with a clear set of eyes and seeing if I get a different thread, but I will probably speedrun some other books first.</p>

<p class="subtitle">On feeling blocked, redux</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>Ages ago, when struggling to write, I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-20-10:33.html">On feeling blocked</a>, in which I describe the phenomenology of writer's block.</p>


<p>I've been really struggling with writing my newsletter recently, so I've decided to solve this with resuming daily writing, and it seemed natural to start by returning to the subject. A year and a half on I have a very different perspective on writer's block.</p>


<p>It's this: Writer's block is not wanting to write, or wanting not to write.</p>


<p>This may seem overly simple, but it's not. It just moves the complexity. Wanting is complicated.</p>


<p>In particular, often some parts of you will want to write, and some parts of you will want not to write, and the resulting inner conflict leads to writer's block.</p>


<p>In "On feeling blocked":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Being blocked feels like this. It's not that there's an actual block, it's that you reach for a part of your brain where the words come from and it's not there. You can't run out of ideas and you know this, but you try to follow the steps of the idea generating process and the world glitches and you realise you cut off mid-sentence and have been reading Twitter for the last half hour.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>That sort of distraction is exactly what (at least one type of) an inner conflict feels like. A part of you drives you to write, a part of you resists with some emotional judo and redirects you somewhere else.</p>


<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3l08rfl">On Writer's Block</a> by Victoria Nelson is a good book about the emotional dynamics of writer's block which, ultimately, boils down to a long discussion of reasons why you might want not to write. Typically they're some variation on wanting to write something that you don't feel able to, or that you feel scared about in some way.</p>


<p>In particular they often come down to trying to adhere to a standard that you don't feel you can be good enough for, or feeling that you should write in a way that isn't actually very good.
e.g. a lot of people get blocked because they're trying to write like they learned to in school and everything comes out boring.</p>


<p>I'm blocked on my newsletter at the moment. I don't entirely know why, but the symptom is that I have lots of unfinished posts. The solution is probably to write the newsletter more like I do the notebook. I don't feel able to do that, I don't know why yet.</p>


<p>In the meantime, I'm going to get back to writing even if I can't write the newsletter. Life is much better when I write.</p>


<p>The fundamental principles are the same as they always are. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-05-08:59.html">Make success trivial</a> then apply <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">the fully general system</a>. The fact that in this case the hard thing is something that I already in theory know how to do doesn't matter, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-12-08:19.html">things can be hard for lots of reasons</a>.</p>

<p class="subtitle">how to write like this</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-08-08</dd>
</dl>


<p><a href="https://drossbucket.com/">Lucy</a> and I were talking about the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-27-04:25.html">You have to do the easy bits first</a> piece, and she asked me how I wrote it.</p>


<p>It's a good question. I didn't answer it very well.</p>


<p>Here, let's have another go.</p>


<p>The way to write like this is to write like this.</p>


<p>That isn't a very helpful answer, huh.</p>


<p>One more time.</p>


<p>The way to write like THIS is to write like THIS!</p>


<p>the way to write</p>


<p>like this</p>


<p>is to write</p>


<p>like this</p>


<p>thewaytowritelikethisistowritelike this</p>


<p>You see?</p>


<p>The way to change how you write is to change how you write.</p>


<p>The best part of the answer I gave Lucy earlier is that the thing where the paragraphs are short (I said one sentence, but actually looking again they're not) is more important than you'd think.</p>


<p>The way to change the voice you write in is to write in a different voice.</p>


<p>And the voice of your writing is</p>


<p>determined by its form. As you shift</p>


<p>the layout</p>


<p>the format</p>


<p>the literal physical way the words appear on the page</p>


<p>the sound of what you are writing changes, and with it the voice in which you write moves to match.</p>


<p>When I write like this, in long discursive paragraphs, in which I patiently explain the thing I am doing to you, that is one voice. I can fuck with it if I want, right? Code switch mid paragraph. I don't have to write like a tedious book, but this is the tone that I naturally fall back into, because habits of writing are entrained ways of being, that one grows comfortable in. If you try to do a thing that is well served by a particular mode, you have to actively exert effort to avoid falling back into that mode. It's entirely possible, especially if you have other modes that you're used to and can borrow from, but without the clarity that those modes provide, it is difficult to avoid. It is hard to write differently without first deciding what that difference is, and the easiest form of difference is to be able to say "More like <em>that</em>".</p>


<p>When you fuck with the form</p>


<p>you instantly break the habit</p>


<p>because</p>


<p>the habit can no longer serve you.</p>


<p>Will the result be good? Nah, probably not. That's OK.</p>


<p><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/first/en122/lecturelist-2015-16-2/shklovsky.pdf">Viktor Shklovsky thinks that art is about defamiliarisation</a>, and I think this is even more true for the artist than for the viewer of the art.
In order to create art, you must first break out of your habitual mode of engaging with the thing you are depicting.
Anything that breaks the habit by forcing you outside of what it can do will help you to achieve that,
by pushing you into a mode where everything is strange, and giving you a space in which to learn that strangeness.</p>


<p>but if you do what you also do</p>


<p>you'll get what you always get.</p>


<p>This is uncomfortable at first, of course it is. You're learning a whole new way of engaging with the world through writing.
Stay with that discomfort, and write through it, and see what happens.</p>


<p>Or, in short:</p>


<p>The way to write like this is to write like this.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes towards a social technology R&amp;D lab</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-08-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>I mentioned on Twitter that I'd like to run a "small R&amp;D lab where we mostly do low budget weird social technology nonsense".
This was not something I mentioned as a serious plan, but a throwaway comment about escapist fantasies.
There was a surprising amount of interest in the idea though.</p>


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I should maybe mention that if you want to spot me about £2 million over a 3-4 year period to change the world, I'm all ears and we should definitely talk. <a href="https://t.co/EvHd5tcDXh">https://t.co/EvHd5tcDXh</a></p>— David R. MacIver (@DRMacIver) <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1423669891345813507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2021</a></blockquote>


<p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>


<p>In response to this, people have quite reasonably be asking what it is I actually <em>mean</em> by this plan, because it's not obvious.
So I thought I'd try to articulate this.</p>


<p>(This is not really a proper pitch document, more of a sketch of the idea, but if you've got some spare cash and <em>want</em> a proper pitch document it could definitely turn into one).</p>


<h3>What's social technology?</h3>


<p>I think people might have the wrong idea about what I mean by "social technology", which is fair enough as it's not a particularly commonly used term. By "social technology", I don't mean a type of software, I mean something more like sets of practices that people can do together, that have the character of technology, in that they are a well defined thing that benefits from research and development.</p>


<p>I talked about this in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/the-missing-social-technology-sector/">The missing social technology sector</a>. My definition from there is:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Social technology is “technology” built out of groups of people following rules, maybe with assistance from simple props, rather than software, machinery, etc.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I've since read Nguyen's "Games: Agency as Art", which I think has helped refine my thoughts on this subject more. Social technology is technology built out of <em>group agency</em>. It builds a structure to constrain and support the sort of actions that a group can take together, in a way that helps them achieve some desired end.</p>


<p>Here are some examples of a social technology:</p>


<ol>
<li>A pen and paper roleplaying game. Dungeons and Dragons is the classic example, but I think lightweight games like <a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/">Lasers and Feelings</a> or <a href="https://img.fireden.net/tg/image/1491/35/1491350819880.pdf">Four Sherlock Holmes and a Vampire. (Who Is Also One of the Aforementioned Sherlock Holmes)</a> where the rules fit in a page are a more interesting set of examples.</li>
<li>Speed dating.</li>
<li><a href="https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/">Lean Coffee</a></li>
<li>Coaching and therapy type arrangements</li>
</ol>


<p>These are designed with the following ends in mind:</p>


<ol>
<li>A roleplaying game has a <em>ludic end</em> (the thing you are trying to achieve in the game - uncover the vampire, prevent Zorgon the Conqueror from building a quantum tunnel that will rip a hole in reality), but the ultimate end is to have fun, and you are adopting the ludic end in order to achieve that.</li>
<li>Speed dating you are looking for people to date.</li>
<li>Lean Coffee you are trying to have a productive discussion across a range of topics, and the structure supports you in picking interesting topics and keeping the meeting on track.</li>
<li>Coaching and therapy provide someone with a space to work through a particular problem of interest to them.</li>
</ol>


<p>There are plenty of other examples, both explicit and implicit. For example, <a href="https://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structures</a> is an entire group of people designing social technology for meetings, and every interviewing pipeline is an ad hoc and buggy piece of social technology. The academic field of social choice theory (which mostly designs voting systems) is a really interesting area of social technology that to within rounding error of nobody uses.</p>


<p>Of course in a certain light almost everything people do is social technology. There isn't a hard and fast line that makes some things social technology and some things not social technology, in the same way "But is it art?" is an unanswerable question. As a concept, "social technology" is useful less for categorising things and more as a lens through which to view them.</p>


<p>In particular viewing something as social technology starts from asking two questions:</p>


<ol>
<li>What is this practice trying to do?</li>
<li>How can we do that better?</li>
</ol>


<h3>Why do we need social technology R&amp;D?</h3>


<p>One of the most common pieces of social technology that I've encountered outside of games is meeting facilitation.
Liberating Structures is one of the best examples of meeting facilitation social technology that I'm familiar with,
and mostly seems to be very good.</p>


<p>In contrast, most other social technology I've encountered for meeting faciliation are quite bad, and leans heavily on the skill of the meeting facilitator rather than the technology, and the technology itself is often quite clunky.</p>


<p>Take lean coffee for example. A lot of people really like lean coffee. I attended some lean coffee sessions and they were awful. I loved the idea, I loved what it was trying to do, and the execution has obvious glaring flaws that I feel would have been obvious and easily fixable if they had ever done any sort of playtesting. I cannot imagine they did.
In response I designed <a href="https://github.com/DRMacIver/systems/blob/master/tempo.md">TickTalk</a>, which I think is pretty good. It could certainly use more play testing itself, but it's had some and I really do think it's <em>far</em> better than lean coffee.</p>


<p>Brainstorming is another example. Brainstorming doesn't work. We're pretty sure of this now. It produces results that are worse than not using it. Many things <em>like</em> brainstorming work, and work well, but brainstorming itself very much doesn't.
A little bit of development and experimentation could have revealed this early on, but instead as far as I can tell people just had an idea, slapped a name on it, and declared it the hot new thing that everyone should be doing, and it worked.</p>


<p>The common theme here (and why liberating structures tend to be Actually Good) is obvious I hope: <em>Playtest your social technology</em>, and learn from it and improve it.
People don't do this enough, and are using really bad systems as a result.</p>


<p>Social technology R&amp;D is the solution to this problem. You treat these systems as a piece of technology like any other, and you develop them as such. You try things, you see what works, and you refine based on that.</p>


<p>This isn't a novel idea in social technology, everyone who designes games knows this. If you make a game and don't playtest it, you'll get a game that isn't fun and nobody plays. In contrast, when you design a meeting facilitation system, it only has to be less bad than an unfacilitated meeting (this isn't hard), and also you can usually impose it by fiat, so there's much less direct incentive to be good. This is ridiculous though - meetings are expensive and potentially high value, so anything that increases that value or decrease that cost is obviously good.</p>


<h3>Weird low budget social technology nonsense?</h3>


<p>What I'm interested in has two defining features:</p>


<ol>
<li>Developing social technologies for a broad range of problems.</li>
<li>...that can be implemented easily and cheaply.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, take speed dating. Has anyone actually ever done any speed dating R&amp;D? Speed dating doesn't seem to work particularly well for people, and some of that is because dating is intrinsically awkward, but a lot of it does seem like the structure is just very poorly designed.</p>


<p>I'm pretty confident nobody has ever done a detailed user experience analysis of speed dating and tried to improve it in a principled way. Someone just had the idea, people tweaked it a bit, and it mostly works well enough. For the same reason meeting design lacks a strong incentive to improve (because meetings are so bad that anything helps), speed dating has little incentive to improve (because there's no shortage of single people who would really like some help with dating).</p>


<p>Additionally, speed dating is primarily a low value proposition. People don't pay a lot for speed dating, so where would the budget for improving it come from?</p>


<p>(People <em>do</em> use speed dating for research, but it seems to be primarily using speed dating as a methodology for studying romantic interactions. i.e. it's people taking the social technology as read and using it to do social science)</p>


<p>Taking something like speed dating and improving it for its intended purpose, and also finding other interesting applications of those approaches (for example, what would a "Speed dating, but you're there to make friends" event look like? How should one do bi/poly speed dating? Could one do a speed dating event to start up a co-coaching network?), is the sort of low budget social technology I'd like to develop.</p>


<p>Another example of a problem I think would be interesting to study is this: <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2016/11/democracy-for-lunch/">How do you decide where to go for lunch?</a>. Or where to go to the cinema. Or what to cook tonight... You get the idea. Collective decision making is common, but I don't actually know how common, and I don't know what the best way to do it is.
I have a history of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-15:27.html">solving this for people by just telling them what to do</a>, but it sure would be interesting to study this class of problem and how to do it better, wouldn't it?</p>


<p>In general, the sort of thing I would like to do is:</p>


<ol>
<li>Identify reasonably common social problems.</li>
<li>Develop social technologies to improve them that can be explained in one or two pages, and implemented with cheap and/or commonly available tools.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think there is a <em>lot</em> of low hanging fruit of this nature, mostly based on the fact that the individual examples that gain traction don't seem like they're still very much picking low hanging fruit, and it shouldn't be hard to find others.</p>


<h3>What would this look like in practice?</h3>


<p>Gosh, that's a great question, this has turned from a vague idea into something resembling a structured plan remarkably quickly, so this is the bit underspecified, so please bear in mind that I wasn't planning to do this for a while and part of the thing that this would look like in practice is getting a bunch of people together to figure out the details.</p>


<p>The general procedure we'd want to use for developing social technology is:</p>


<ol>
<li>Create or identify a prototype piece of social technology with a Version 0 document describing it.</li>
<li>Playtest it amongst ourselves, then with random members of the public, until we're happy with it.</li>
<li>Publish a Version 1.0 version of the social technology in public, probably under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> license.</li>
<li>Over time publish updated and improved versions of it in response to subsequent usage and feedback.</li>
</ol>


<p>Both (1) and (2) are the bits that need a lot of trial and error. The following are probably the two main sources of prototypes:</p>


<ol>
<li>Study what people actually do in the wild and extract it into something standalone.<ul>
<li>Often this can start from existing literature. e.g. speed dating comes pre studied. The "teaching open ended style" protocol from Vaughn Tan's The Uncertainty Mindset that I talked about in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-teach-the-local-style">How to teach the local style</a> is another example where you can just get it from books.</li>
<li>Often you can get paid to find this out! Going into a company and consulting with them is a great way to find out what they actually do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Starting from problems people have (e.g. we could find this out by offering coaching and consultancy services) and then trying to generate solutions to those. This would probably need us to work a bit on the social technology that supports generating these solutions, but I expect we'd be using Liberating Structures or the like as starting points for that rather than trying to invent new ones from scratch.</li>
<li>Actively work on the social technology underpinning how the group runs itself, and try to extract this into reusable standalone features.</li>
</ol>


<p>As well as producing the actual final products, there would probably be:</p>


<ul>
<li>A lot of writing about the things we learn along the way.</li>
<li>Various professional services built on top of this. I think there is quite a lot of scope for this to lead into a lucrative consulting and training business around these things, as a lot of it would be quite useful to companies.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What would this need?</h3>


<p>My dream version of this where I get to run an actual R&amp;D institution looks something like this.</p>


<p>Staff would be:</p>


<ul>
<li>A small team of about 5 for the actual R&amp;D.</li>
<li>Someone to do admin.</li>
<li>Probably someone to do sales and marketing? Certainly this would be needed eventually.</li>
</ul>


<p>A lot of this would need to be done in person (at least post COVID...). This would require an office and a studio space for running events.</p>


<p>On top of that there would need to be budget for:</p>


<ul>
<li>All the usual company stuff. Computers, paying for software, etc.</li>
<li>Quite a lot of training, partly for people's personal growth, partly because it's important research.</li>
<li>Hiring people on one off contracts, for a mix of:</li>
<li>Consulting specialists</li>
<li>Paying people to do initial playtesting.</li>
<li>A flexible group of people who we could bring in to do various research tasks (e.g. send out a bunch of interns to learn more about different meetup groups).</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm expecting the professional services arm of the group would do quite well (it's potentially very high value for corporate customers). Initially (and to some degree ongoing - it's a good habit to keep your hand in on) this would be done by the R&amp;D team. With increased demand, it would be necessary to bring on more staff to keep up with it, and eventually I would expect us to transition to having a full training arm.</p>


<h3>How plausible is all this?</h3>


<p>Honestly pretty plausible. Some of it is stuff I could do today, and may well start doing as I start providing more consulting and corporate training options built in to my existing work. It's possible that in five years time I may be doing exactly what I describe given no external intervention, assuming I still think it's a good idea.</p>


<p>The big questions are:</p>


<ol>
<li>Is there as much low hanging fruit as I think there is? (I'm reasonably confident there is)</li>
<li>Am I underestimating the amount of work playtesting takes? (I don't think so, in the sense that the amount of work people currently do is so low that even modest amounts would be an improvement)</li>
<li>Is there really enough demand for this to fund it? (I'm genuinely unsure about this one, but I think it's likely that there is if it's pitched right).</li>
<li>Would this end up a niche thing used only by corporates and weirdos? (This is a totally plausible failure mode. Certainly I expect many of the things we develop would never see wide adoption. But I figure worst case scenario we make a lot of money improving various work environments and maybe make one or two useful prosocial innovations)</li>
</ol>


<p>All told I'd be very surprised if <em>something</em> in this space couldn't be made to work, and also very surprised if what ends up working looks exactly like I've outlined in this document, because technology startups never work out that way, and that's ultimately what this idea is.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Unlearning</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>

<p>I got distracted, and it got late, so here's a short piece on how schools are terrible, as <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1421488767257518081">this seems to be the thing I'm talking about today</a>.</p>


<p>From "How Children Fail", page 259:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The confused and hopeless children that I have worked with naturally never test as well as their abler classmates; but they are never much more than a year or two behind. This year, according to the tests, my worst pupils had the mathematical knowledge and skill of an average child entering the fourth grade. In short, they presumably knew addition, subtraction, place value, multiplication, and easy division. But this is utter nonsense. These children know <em>nothing</em> about arithmetic; in any <em>real</em> sense they don't know what first-graders are suppsoed to know. An accurate test, if there could be such a thing, a measuring instrument that really measured something, would give them a score of one point something [compared to a peer average of 5.5].</p>
<p>No. Much closer to the truth to say that an accurate test, if there had been such a thing, would have given them a <em>minus</em> score. After five years of school - in one of the "best" schools - they were worse off, in terms of arithmetic (and not just arithmetic), than if they had never been in school at all.</p>
<p>How are these high scores achieved? A week or two before the tests, their teachers begin an intensive drilling on all the kinds of problems they will have to do on the test. By the time the test comes along the children are conditioned, like Pavlov's dog; when they see a certain arrangement of numerals and symbols before them, lights begin to flash, wheels begin to turn, and like robots they go through the answer-getting process, or enough of them to get a halfway decent score. Teachers are not supposed to do this; but they all do.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>One of the things that I often end up arguing about with regards to schools is whether it's good that they teach the things they do. Surely it's better for people to learn a bit of writing, mathematics, etc. that they can build on later, even if they're taught less well than they could be?</p>


<p>Honestly, I think it's not, because this assumes that "taught less well than they could be" is like "taught as well as they could be" but less so, but that's mostly not the case. Instead people are <em>taught things that they shouldn't be</em>, in the sense that the things they are taught are wrong and/or useless, and stand in the way of them later learning things properly.</p>


<p>Some of this is the sort of "emotional lesson" I talked about in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-20-00:32.html">The trauma model of talent blocks</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/made_in_cosmos/status/1412862625516507139">Maria has a good thread of such lessons</a>.</p>


<p>This also extends to more practical things.</p>


<p>The above anecdote about mathematics education is I think a good example of this: Even if you could help those kids unlearn all of their traumatic associations with mathematics, they've had their head filled with nonsensical rules and rituals they've memorised that are going to actively get in the way.</p>


<p>This also happens when people are "good" at the subject, because people can learn to pass tests to a really very high grade on this kind of rote memorisation. I once had to explain to someone doing university physics that the expression \(f(x)\) didn't mean \(f\) multiplied by \(x\), but instead evaluating the function \(f\) at the value \(x\). It's literally impossible that she had gotten to that point without having to apply functions, but she'd just learned the rules to follow and had no working model of mathematics on which to base those rules. She <em>probably</em> got this untangled OK without having to unlearn everything (I wasn't much help, and honestly probably wasn't very nice about it, but in my defence I was 18 at the time).</p>


<p>Mathematics has the advantage that at least if you're able to figure the subject out you can pass it well by actually being good at mathematics. Some skills, this is harder. Being actually good at writing doesn't help unless you're also school good at writing, and school good at writing produces really boring writing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM">See Larry McEnerney's critiques for details</a>. Most people have writing habits they need to unlearn from school, and they'd probably have been better off spending their English classes writing fanfic and arguing on tumblr.</p>


<p>(This isn't a dig exactly, those are both very good ways to learn to write)</p>


<p>I also notice that people very much need to unlearn reading habits. Most people I know who were book worms as kids struggle to read as adults, and my advice for this is basically <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1418610947107823626">read badly</a>. I don't <em>know</em> that this one is a school leftover, but it sure feels like it to me.</p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1421530364552482820">I don't set educational policy</a>, so I don't know what the solution to this is. My personal bias is that when we simultaneously have a problem where we don't have enough school resources, and also most of what we teach is actively harmful, we could solve the former by just teaching way fewer subjects to a higher standard, but there's probably some bad consequence downstream of not ruining most subjects for most people that I'm not currently seeing.</p>


<p>In the meantime, I guess my main advice is to notice that this is a thing. When you're trying to learn something you've previously struggled with, you don't just need to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-16-10:12.html">overcome hurdles in learning</a> where you previously got stuck, you probably need to back up from the wrong turn you took when trying to work around those.</p>
