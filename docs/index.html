<p class="subtitle">Vampire bats as a model for flirting</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-31</dd>
</dl>


<p>Because <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-29-21:16.html">everything is a teachable moment</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html">all knowledge is connected</a>, I'm now going to explain why the social behaviour of vampire bats tells us important things about flirting.</p>


<p>Disclaimer: I am bad at flirting. I've got a lot better at it recently, but I am definitely not good at it. This is a post based on the process of my becoming less bad at it. Fortunately that's <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahdoingthing/status/877018612447313920/photo/1">apparently the perfect time to write about such things</a>.</p>


<p>Anyway, before we talk about flirting, lets talk about vampire bats. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/science/vampire-bats-blood.html">Vampire bats know sharing blood with friends is good manners</a>, and this is how flirting works too. Well, flirting rarely involves the sharing of blood except for at very specific sorts of parties that I do not get invited to, but the general principle is sound.</p>


<p>The way vampire bats share blood between non-kin is that they start by grooming. If that's reciprocated, they maybe share a little bit of blood. If that too is reciprocated, they share more, and so on. They <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html">build trust</a> by repeatedly offering slightly more than was previously offered, and waiting to see if it's reciprocated. This is called a raising-the-stakes game. The general strategy is described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/28160">Development of cooperative relationships through increasing investment</a>, although I confess to not actually having read it yet.</p>


<p>This is also how flirting works.</p>


<p>I previously wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">about sexiness and the process of attraction</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Experiencing someone as sexy is about fascination. You see something about them, and it draws you in, and makes you want to learn more about them and to explore it. It makes you want more of it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Skillfull flirting is about mutually cooperating to escalate this fascination. You exhibit interest, to see if it is reciprocated, and you progressively dance your way through this back and forth, each of you expressing some interest and seeing how the other responds to it. If they don't, you back off (or at least stop escalating and stay at the currently comfortable level). If they do, you escalate further.</p>


<p>Eventually, if you both want it to, you've each drawn the other in enough that it becomes time to make the fascination more explicit, either by action (e.g. kissing) or talking about it, but this doesn't have to happen. Flirtation is about escalating fascination, but you don't have to keep escalating, you can just have fun with it at whatever level you like.</p>


<p>This can go wrong in three major ways.</p>


<p>The first is that you can just mess it up. Unskillful performance of flirting is incompetent, and thus unsexy, so may turn the other party off and lose the fascination. (If you're lucky and they're into you it may be adorable rather than unsexy, which has some chance of success. If I'm honest this is historically the most successful flirting strategy I have adopted).</p>


<p>The second, is that you may lack the skills of picking up on interest. This is particularly true if you struggle to conceive of yourself as attractive (you miss interest that is there). It can also be true if you read interest that is not there (men are often bad at this - I've heard it said that men tend to overinterpret friendliness as flirting and women tend to overinterpret flirting as friendliness), but that tends to lead to unskillful performance.</p>


<p>The third, and is the way I have personally failed at this until recently, is that you can be bad at showing interest you actually feel.</p>


<p>If attraction is fascination, then flirting is a process by which you create attraction. Usually it starts from some initial seed, but it can go down as well as up - if your attraction is very obviously not reciprocated, it will tend to diminish (this isn't always true, and there are some ways the opposite can play out, but they tend to be predicated on both a high level of initial attraction and the possibility in principle of it being reciprocated).</p>


<p>A consequence of that is this is that unless you are in some way extraordinarily attractive, unless you can demonstrate the attraction you feel towards others, they will probably not exhibit much attraction to you. If you find yourself in a situation where people just don't seem to find you attractive, consider whether that might be what's going on.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Desire as a driver of growth</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-30</dd>
</dl>


<p>I wrote before about how <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety is the enabler of growth</a>: The thing that allows you to grow is to be safe to experiment, so you can learn new ways of being.</p>


<p>This is true as far as it goes, but it has a big problem: If you're safe, it's very easy to just stay where you are.
The possibility to grow exists, but you have no particular reason to take it, so you don't.</p>


<p>You can see this in the stereotype of the spoiled rich kid (although often they're not exactly in safe environments either, so this is weak evidence. Consider it an illustrative example).</p>


<p>The basic problem is that growth is hard work. You have to want to do it. You have to actually <em>desire</em> to grow.</p>


<p>One key to doing this is what I wrote about in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-23-15:52.html">life as an anytime algorithm</a>: Designing goals so that you gain partial benefits as you go. This ensures that you're getting feedback on growth as you proceed, and it doesn't feel like <a href="https://www.fvathynevgl.com/momentum/">a long hard slog with hopefully a reward at the end</a>.</p>


<p>This isn't enough, because it depends on what type of progress you're making. In particular, I reliably find that progress that just makes things less bad doesn't have the right shape. 
The nagging urge is always there to backslide and just fall back to the old ways. The old ways weren't good, but they sure were easier, and stable, and stability is comforting.</p>


<p>In order to create a desire for growth you need the changes you see to be an actively positive thing.
It makes you hungry for more, and the work feels less like work and more like achievement.</p>


<p>Two examples where I have encountered this:</p>


<ul>
<li>In my various work on <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">emotions</a> one of my specific goals has been around the experience of positive emotions. I don't just want to be less miserable, I want to be happier.</li>
<li>I've been working on my diet. This means I no longer have a permanently upset stomach. That's great and all, but it sure is tempting to backslide because pizza is delicious. But... I must admit, I'm really enjoying the weight loss. I know, I know, body positivity, but I feel <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">a lot better about my body</a> than I have in some time, and that's really nice.</li>
</ul>


<p>You need to clear out the negative stuff too (more of my emotion work is on anxiety than joy, but the two feed into each other). It's important not to overfocus on the positive, but without the positive to drive growth you will often give up, and that means you end up doing less work on the negatives in total.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Everything is a teachable moment</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-29</dd>
</dl>


<p>Previously I have written blog posts about:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/thinking-through-the-implications/">A cat who can open doors</a></li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-26-09:48.html">Fixing a shower</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/08/how-did-you-get-started-so-quickly/">How to get started in a new code base</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Except that's not what any of these are about.</p>


<p>They're actually about:</p>


<ul>
<li><em>Toolkitized thinking</em> - how to apply things that you've learned in other contexts</li>
<li><em>Pragmatic problem solving</em> - how to let go of the desire to solve the problem properly and just solve the problem</li>
<li><em>Efficient learning</em> - how not to get distracted by <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-22-18:01.html">the impossibly large number of things to learn</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of them are of course about both these things: Something happened, and by looking at what happened you can learn something generalisable about it.</p>


<p>Typically of course, you don't actually see a single thing and get the general insight, you acquire the general insight after seeing many different things, but often a specific example is exactly what you need to <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/">explain the point</a>, possibly to someone else, possibly to yourself.</p>


<p>The important feature of these generalisations is that by doing this you learn beyond the specific circumstances you encounter and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758026/">experience the world richly</a>, letting you draw on your past experience more effectively in novel situations.</p>


<p>One way of looking at mathematics is that it's about taking a look at an argument and paring it down to its bare essentials and generalising it. Trying to take something hyper specific and turn it into a simple reusable principle that can be applied, by asking what about the problem actually matters.</p>


<p>Our interactions with the world are like this too. Everything is a teachable moment, all you have to do is look at it through the right lens and use it to teach something.</p>

<p class="subtitle">On having different thresholds</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-28</dd>
</dl>


<p>Observe the following behaviours:</p>


<ul>
<li>Not expressing your wants or needs until they become essential for you.</li>
<li>Not talking about your feelings until you can't cope with them.</li>
<li>Not telling someone that their behaviour is bad until you can't deal with it.</li>
<li>Not expressing an opinion until you are certain it's true.</li>
<li>Not articulating a thought process until you've fully understood it.</li>
</ul>


<p>These share the following major features:</p>


<ol>
<li>They are about where you set a <em>threshold for action</em>. How X does a thing have to be before you do Y?</li>
<li>They are very common.</li>
<li>They are really really unhealthy.</li>
</ol>


<p>For most people, lowering these thresholds will significantly improve your experience of and behaviour in the world.
That's not to say that the thresholds should be set at zero, and there are definitely people who have them set too low, but by and large the norms around where they <em>should</em> be set are much too high.</p>


<p>Why? Well because if you don't do anything until something breaks then you will be constantly <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html">skirting the edge of disaster</a>. For example if you don't express needs until they're essential, none of your non-essential needs are going to be adequately met. You'll maybe not be in crisis, but you'll be low-grade miserable.</p>


<p>But, once you learn healthier behaviour and set these thresholds lower, you're going to run into a huge problem.
You've suddenly become <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html">illegible to other people</a>.</p>


<p>The problem is this: Other people do not have access to your internal state. They do not know how X the thing is, they only know that you have done Y. This will cause them to assume that when you do Y, the thing is as X for you as it would be when other people do Y. This means that if you express an emotion, people will think it is a big deal. If you complain about a bad behaviour, people will think you must be really bothered by it.</p>


<p>A concrete example is that I was trying Capoeira last year. About halfway through my second lesson I realised that actually this really isn't for me right now, and that I could cope with the rest of the lesson but it would be moderately unpleasant and I definitely wouldn't be coming back for another one, so I made my apologies and left.
I realised afterwards that people probably thought I was in quite a lot of distress, because that felt like a major move to them. I wasn't. I was just making what for me was a perfectly sensible decision, but most people wouldn't have made it until breaking point.</p>


<p>This is why talking about feelings often feels like high drama / making a big deal out of nothing. It's not. Talking about feelings is great, and is in fact how you avoid drama and making big deals out of things that don't need to be. But because people are used to not talking about feelings until they absolutely need to be dealt with, when you talk about feelings before they need to be dealt with people assume you're making more of an issue of it than not.</p>


<p>Differing thresholds are like <a href="https://sambleckley.com/writing/church-of-interruption.html">the church of interruption</a>. People have incompatible conversation norms, and they don't realise that they do or don't know how to fluently speak the other's, so they are constantly miscuing off each other.</p>


<p>The solution, I'm afraid, is more talking. It has long been my stance that you need to have conversations about how to have conversations with people, and a crucial part of that is talking about what bringing things up means and how best to do it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Competence is sexy</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-27</dd>
</dl>


<p>(Up front disclaimer: I am treating my personal experiences as universal in this post. I think the things I am saying in this post are fairly universally true, but there are obviously going to be people who experience this differently)</p>


<p>"Be attractive, don't be unattractive" sounds like trite advice, but actually it contains an important insight (or at least can be read in a deep way): In order to attract people you need to <em>not turn them off</em> (don't be unattractive) and you need to <em>draw them in</em> (be attractive).
Sexiness is what draws people in.</p>


<p>What is sexiness?</p>


<p>Well, to a large degree, sexiness is competence.</p>


<p>I'm serious.
You must have noticed how sexy people being good at things is.
This is a general thing. There's something intrinsically attractive about competence, and most forms of sexiness can be framed as competencies.</p>


<p>(An example of a non-competency sexiness is that someone being attracted to you is also sexy, and is not a competency per se unless you're self-assured enough to view it as evidence of them having very good taste)</p>


<p>Experiencing someone as sexy is about fascination. You see something about them, and it draws you in, and makes you want to learn more about them and to explore it. It makes you want more of it. And nothing does this like looking at someone and noticing just how phenomenally <em>good</em> they are at something.</p>


<p>Not all competencies are equally sexy of course. An amazingly good ballet dancer is (for most people) intrinsically sexy than an equally amazing chess player. But... the latter isn't <em>not</em> sexy, as long as you're well placed to appreciate their competence (If you don't understand chess you probably won't find it sexy).</p>


<p>But, even for most people who understand chess, the ballet dancer is probably still sexier.</p>


<p>This is true even independently of body type. If you somehow had someone who was both an expert ballet dancer and an expert chess player, almost everyone would experience watching them perform ballet as sexier than watching them play chess.</p>


<p>Which competencies are perceived as sexy is highly individual, but by and large physical and emotional components of competencies are sexier than mental ones. The reason for this is pretty straightforward: For most (but by no means all) people, the physical and emotional components of sex take precedence over the intellectual ones, so this sort of competence is intrinsically more sexual.</p>


<p>You may, of course, be puzzled at the fact that I am talking about sexiness and ignoring physical appearance.
But actually physical appearance is a perfect example of what I'm talking about:
Physical appearance is <em>very</em> much a competency.</p>


<p>Some people are, of course, unambiguously better at physical appearance than others. Some people really are just going to be <a href="https://www.fvathynevgl.com/effortlessness/">effortlessly</a> attractive. The rest of us have to work at it, to a greater or lesser extent.
However, this is a normal part of competency. Someone who is an amazing ballet dancer has worked incredibly hard at it, but they also probably have intrinsic advantages (strength, balance, body type) that others who are less good do not.</p>


<p>How do you do competence at physical appearance? You do it by <em>performing an aesthetic</em>.</p>


<p>Different aesthetics will appeal differently to different people, but unless the aesthetic is utterly absurd (clowns aren't sexy no matter how good they are at performing the clown aesthetic. No shaming intended if you're into that, but I am never going to understand your mindset on this subject), performing it well is always going to be fairly sexy.</p>


<p>Edit to Add: OK fine a friend has convinced me of the possibility that sufficiently competent clowning might be sexy too.</p>


<p>This is why gender is such a big thing in most people's experience of sexiness: Aesthetics tend to be heavily gendered, and a great deal (not all, maybe not even most, but a major component) of what gender <em>is</em> for most people is conformance to a specific gendered aesthetic.
It would be an exaggeration to say that gender is intrinsically sexy, but performance of gender gives people many exciting opportunities for exhibiting sexiness.</p>


<p>Interestingly, this is true even for aesthetics that are "wrong" for your gender. Competent performance of an aesthetic designed for a gender different from your own can be <em>incredibly</em> sexy if you can pull it off, it's just easier for most people (both through training and through how the aesthetic was designed) to perform sexiness with an aesthetic that matches their gender. It's the performance of the aesthetic itself that is sexy, your appearance just defines how easy it is for you to perform any given aesthetic competently.</p>


<p>It is at this point I must tell you a fact that I, as a card carrying bisexual, am all too acutely aware of:
in western anglophone cultures, women are on average substantially more attractive than men.</p>


<p>Before I continue, let me show you an extremely attractive man.</p>


<p><img alt="A spanish soldier" src="/images/spanish-soldier-2.jpg"/></p>


<p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/JillFilipovic/status/1241857598778900481">From a thirst tweet</a>)</p>


<p>Sexy, right? (Dear Spanish soldier man: In the extremely unlikely event that you're reading this, I'm very sorry for objectifying you in this way. Well... mostly sorry. It's in a good cause.).</p>


<p>Why is he sexy? It's because he is performing an extremely masculine aesthetic <em>very</em> competently.
You don't need to be nearly this good at masculinity to perform it competently enough to be sexy. This is fairly upper tier.</p>


<p>Also, if you read the comments, a lot of people are coming to an inescapable conclusion: He looks really gay.</p>


<p>This is bullshit of course. Maybe he is, I don't know him, but just based on weight of numbers I'm going to say probably not. He certainly <em>reads</em> as gay in our (western, anglophone) culture, but there's a very specific reason for this: We treat competent performance of most masculine aesthetics as gay (there are a few exceptions, but they mostly tend to be for celebrities or people who can pretend to be doing it on natural talent alone, and even then there's a bit of it).</p>


<p>The basic reason why women are more attractive on average is that they are better at performing an aesthetic than men are. This is for reasons that are actually quite bad, for both men and women but in different ways.</p>


<p>Women are punished (through misogyny) for not performing an aesthetic competently, while men are punished for trying to excel at it (through homophobia). The result is that there is vastly more cultural knowledge around how women can perform feminine aesthetics competently than there is for men performing masculine aesthetics competently, and also strong incentives for women to apply that knowledge.</p>


<p>The incentive structure is bad (women should not be punished for not wanting to invest effort in their aesthetic if they don't want to), but the lack of widespread cultural knowledge for men on how to improve their aesthetic is also a major problem for us.</p>


<p>In addition to men being punished for success, everyone is punished for failure. The problem is that with aesthetic competence, trying and failing is much worse than not trying. This is especially true for men, not because men are punished more for trying and failing (this is something we are terrible about for people of every gender), but because men are punished less for not trying. It is safer for women to experiment with their aesthetic not because the punishments for failure are less, but because they start from a less safe place so the difference is less. It is more dangerous for men to experiment with their aesthetic not because the punishments for failure are greater, but because they have fewer resources available to them for achieving success.</p>


<p>The result is that men are <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html">socially punished for trying to be good</a> at sexiness, and exist in an environment that is mostly <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">extremely unsafe</a> for them to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">experiment</a>, and consequently there is a kind of massive cultural learned helplessness where men want to develop their aesthetic competency in sexy ways but honestly don't know how to.</p>
