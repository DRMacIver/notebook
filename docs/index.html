<p>Today's reading comes from <a href="https://amzn.to/2VMdTVs">Random Justice: On Lotteries and Legal Decision-Making</a>, page 75-76:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>random selection is intended to provide defendants and litigants with the opportunity to be tried by a representative cross-section of the population. The idea here is that fair and democratic social arrangements require that people be accorded the chance to be tried by juries drawn from a cross-sectionally representative pool. That a randomly selected jury will provide the opportunity to be tried by a representative cross-section of the population is, however, by no means guaranteed. [...] a perfectly representative sample is the average ideal of many random samples of a population and is not to be expected in any particular randomly drawn sample - or on any particular petit jury. Perhaps most importantly of all, even if random selection were to yield a jury perfectly representative of the population, the appropriateness of the outcome might still be contested.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is actually a really excellent point for tying together a number of my interest areas.</p>


<p>In particular it prompts me to think about:</p>


<ul>
<li>The difference between statistical fairness and individual fairness.</li>
<li>What "representative" really means.</li>
<li>Is representativeness good?</li>
<li>The interplay between justice and identity.</li>
<li>The role of legibility in diversity initiatives.</li>
</ul>


<p>As is well known <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/09/towards-a-more-perfect-democracy/">I'm rather a big fan of random selection</a>, and one of the reasons for it is the guaranteed proportionality properties of it. However, there are some major distinctive features of juries compared to the situations I've focused on that I'd not previously appreciated until reading this passage just now (despite having read it before!).</p>


<p>First off, consider the difficulty of representativeness. Say we've got 12 jurors. Any group whose prevalence in the population is not a multiple of \(\frac{1}{12}\) will not be perfectly represented in the jury - they'll either be over or underrepresented.</p>


<p>This is a particularly big deal for minority groups. For example, consider Muslims. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_Kingdom">Wikipedia tells me</a> that 4.4% of the UK population are muslim. Therefore the correct number of muslims on a jury of 12 people is 0.528. This is, obviously, hard to achieve.
Random selection achieves this on average by assigning one muslim to the jury 32% of the time, no muslims 59% of the time, and more than one muslim 9% of the time (these numbers are all rounded). That's all very well, but if you're a muslim and you consider it important to have muslims on your jury, it's of small comfort if you're one of the 59% who doesn't get any. Statistical fairness is all very well, but an individual up for trial might quite reasonably expect that it should be fair in their individual case too.</p>


<p>This leads further to the question of which groups you want represented.
For example, it might be important to consider ethnicity.
Again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_British">according to Wikipedia</a>, 81.9% of the UK population is white. This means you want 9.83 white people on your jury. Depending on whether you round that to 9 or 10, that gives you 2 or 3 people of colour on your jury. But which racial groups do you want in those 2 or 3? People of colour have certain unifying experiences, certainly (e.g. being on the receiving end of racism), but they're very far from a unified group.</p>


<p>This gets worse when you consider intersections. For example, one can be representative of both ethnicity and gender without being representative of their intersection. Does it matter if all three of your people of colour are men but you make up the gender balance by including more white women? It probably does. Intersectionality tells us that the interplay of racism and sexism is significant in ways that are more than the sum of their parts.</p>


<p>Let's take a step back and ask why this matters. It matters because how we form judgements about people is significantly affected by how legible they are to us, and identity is a big part of this.
I've <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/06/the-ethics-of-false-negatives-in-interviewing/">previously written about how this affects interviewing</a>: The heuristics we use for judging people are based on those that are reliable for people who we are familiar with, a group that is generally heavily biased towards people who are like us. These heuristics are not necessarily prejudicial outside that group, but they may be wildly inaccurate.</p>


<p>This suggests one obvious modification to the principle of representativeness in juries: Where the speaker is part of a minority group, we should aim to err on the side of overrepresentation of that group in the jury.</p>


<p>However, this is tricky, and risks falling afoul of what Amartya Sen, in his book <a href="https://amzn.to/3cDC1jV">Identity and Violence</a> calls the <em>assumption of singularity</em> - the idea that we all have a single immutable identity that has primacy.</p>


<p>A particularly ironic example of how identity can affect our judgement comes from Miranda Fricker's book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3cGXfgG">Epistemic Injustice</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Imagine that a hearer responsibly judges a speaker to be untrustworthy (because insincere) owing to the fact that the speaker avoids looking her in the eye, frequently looks askance, and pauses self-consciously in mid-sentence as if to work out his story. The speaker’s behaviour justifies the hearer’s judgement inasmuch as it fits an empirically reliable stereotype of insincerity. In fact, however, this individual is speaking entirely ingenuously, and his shifty manner is simply due to the rather idiosyncratic manifestations of his extraordinary personal shyness. This speaker, let us agree, constitutes an exception to an empirically reliable rule, and thus the testimonial injustice he suffers is caused not by prejudice but simply by bad luck. What should be said about such an example?</p>
<p>If we were to consider this shyness example to be an instance of testimonial injustice, then it would be a case of non-culpable testimonial injustice: clearly the hearer has done nothing for which she is blameworthy, either epistemically or ethically.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>What should be said about this example is that somehow Fricker has managed to be either unaware of or indifferent to the existence of people with autism. She has taken a generally (but not wholly! Difficulty with eye contact may also result from e.g. trauma) reliable heuristic on neurotypical people, and declared that because the error is not based on an identity group that she recognises as valid, the error is not culpable.</p>


<p>This is almost an example of what I've previously described as <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-23-09:37.html">legibility privileges</a>: The relevant features of identity are ones that are, apparently, illegible to Fricker (autism as a feature identity is perfectly legible, but <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html">legibility is a relationship</a>), and so are discounted from consideration.
If you have an autistic muslim woman on trial and the jury selection carefully is carefully padded out with muslim women in order to give her a fair trial but you end up with a jury of 100% neurotypicals (which is highly likely due to the relatively low prevalence of autism) then the selection would potentially be completely missing the point.</p>


<p>As with many seemingly intractable problems, this admits a relatively feasible solution: You have to ask them. People have choice over what aspects of their identity have primacy, and we have a moral duty to respect those choices.</p>


<p>In the case of the jury, what seems like a natural solution to me is to start the process of jury selection with a negotiation between the prosecution, the defence, and the judge, about some criteria that the defence would like to ensure is represented in the jury, and then ensure that (say) three out of the twelve jurors satisfy those criteria. Both those three and the other nine would still be randomly selected, but they would be selected from within fixed subsets of the population.</p>


<p>You'd need careful guidelines for how this is to be implemented in practice, and I'm not at all an expert in law or jury selection, so it's likely that I'm missing important features, but I do think some principle like this is worth considering every time you're making a decision about someone - whether it's a jury, as in this example, a hiring panel, or otherwise.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Power, baby, power</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-22</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm continuing the theme of notebook posts prompted by random passages from books. I've also decided to deliberately do this on books that aren't from my daily rereading practice to try and use it to integrate some of the books I read less often into my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-13-11:35.html">memetic domus</a>.</p>


<p>Today's reading comes from "I'm very into you", which is a collection of correspondences between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Acker">Kathy Acker</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie_Wark">McKenzie Wark</a>. This section comes from Page 59. I also randomly selected a line (line 8) because Acker apparently hates paragraphs and this made it hard to select a passage manually.</p>


<p>The result is:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I remember going to some Pomo conference Sylvère had a hand in, the early days, and that creep [Bernard Henri] Levy gives a speech (after Sollers has done his usual blather) all about Eve coming out of the rib of Adam, and therefore and therefore... So XXXXXX, very beautiful, asks him a question. Then she disappears. An hour or two later, she reappearing, we ask XXXXXX where she's been. "With Levy." "Why?" "Power, baby, power."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Two things most strike me about this exchange:</p>


<ol>
<li>It is <em>very</em> unsurprising, despite how nice it would be to imagine that human nature doesn't work this way.</li>
<li>It strikes me as very gendered.</li>
</ol>


<p>I'm interested in unpacking the gendered nature of it. I can just about imagine (possibly inaccurately) the script playing out this way if both people involved were women, or both people involved were men, but the thing I can't imagine is it playing out that way if the speaker was a woman and XXXXXX was a man.</p>


<p>Specifically what I can't imagine about it is not that a male XXXXXX wouldn't have been attracted to the powerful woman, but that he would so freely admit it. I genuinely don't know whether it's typical for men to experience power as attractive in a woman (my guess would be yes, but I don't really understand either men or attraction well enough to predict this confidently), but it definitely feels off script for men to <em>admit</em> that.</p>


<p>My impression is that the official cultural script for men being attracted to powerful women is that it's a shame/submission thing. The domme is the official script for the powerful woman who wields power in a sexy manner, and an intrinsic part of the sexiness of this script is partly that you're going off the official gendered script.</p>


<p>I have at least two easily available hypotheses for why this is:</p>


<ul>
<li>Power is coded masculine (perhaps because of a mix of patriarchy and more general <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/gendering/">gendering</a>), so power intrinsically feeds in to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">competent performance of a masculine aesthetic</a>.</li>
<li>Power is just attractive in general and men are supposed to pretend it's not because of masculine bullshit about how we're supposed to be the ones having power over others.</li>
</ul>


<p>A third possibility is that I'm just wrong and this would have played out exactly the same way when gender flipped. I don't <em>think</em> this is the case, but even if it is I'm interested in where I've got these scripts from.</p>


<p>One reason power might be intrinsically sexy is its streamlining nature for a lot of the process of generating attraction. In the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-31-09:52.html">mutual escalation</a> that is flirting, one of the things that slows it down is a safety aspect - not so much physical safety (also that, but that's not the thing that's directly relevant here). People are hesitant in escalation because of fear of rejection and consequences, and power acts as a certain shield to that. Power essentially lets you take shortcuts in the flirting process.</p>


<p>Some of those shortcuts are bad but work, because they involve violating boundaries because you know you can get away with it. Violating boundaries is another of those things which it would be nice to pretend doesn't work but actually does - the reason not to do it is <em>unethical</em>, not that it doesn't work. e.g. just kissing someone fairly early on in the process whether they want you to or not is a pretty effective way of polarizing and finding out if they're into it. You shouldn't do it, but if you're powerful you can probably get away with it.</p>


<p>This may partly explain the gendered nature of power as sexy - in gender training women get trained not to enforce their boundaries, and men get trained to enforce them too rigidly and interpret anything as an attack. If you do this to a woman, you might get away with it. If you do this to a man, you might get punched.</p>


<p>This also, perhaps, explains part of why so many men with power end up turning out to be sexual predators - they've essentially learned that violating boundaries will get them sex. My guess is that many of these men didn't <em>start out</em> rapey, their sense of appropriate behaviour just gradually eroded over time. This doesn't absolve them of responsibility - their actions were still ultimately unethical - but it puts an interesting spin on it. Are we actively training people with power to be ethically worse? If so, what can we do about it? Relying on people with power to be virtuous enough to resist that training doesn't seem like a good solution.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Does a fish have a face?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-21</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm trying a new thing today, which is to integrate my daily notebook practice, my daily rereading practice, and a bit of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">randomization of decision making</a>. I don't plan to do this every day, but I may do it more often.</p>


<p>The basic mechanism:</p>


<ol>
<li>I pick a book of my choosing.</li>
<li>I generate a page number uniformly at random from the main book contents.</li>
<li>I pick an interesting passage and copy it out here.</li>
<li>I then write something inspired by it.</li>
</ol>


<p>If this takes off I'll probably build some tooling into the notebook for getting me to do this properly but for now I'm mostly hand cranking it.</p>


<p>This is partly inspired by having recently-ish been listening to <a href="https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/">Harry Potter and the Sacred Text</a>. I'm deeply indifferent to Harry Potter but have been enjoying their sacred text reading techniques. This process in particular is very loosely inspired by their (in turn somewhat loosely interpreted) practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina">Lectio Divina</a></p>


<p>Today's reading comes from <a href="https://amzn.to/3exHrih">Finding Our Sea Legs</a>, page 126:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>While he hedges his bets when it comes to dogs, it is hard to imagine Levinas having much time for the idea that a fish might have a face, or the idea that I could be infinitely responsible for a fish. Fish, as far as we human beings are concerned, are more alien to us than the stranger who knocks on our door, or the dog who wags his tail in greeting. They move in a different element, they have no lungs, their blood is cold, not warm, they do not sleep. And yet, while they may not have faces in the sense that Levinas means, they still hav efaces, in the ordinary everyday sense: We can look them in the eye, and these denizens of another world can look back.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This might seem like a strange passage (of course fish have faces) but the idea of a "face" in this context is more about our experience of the other as a person. Backtracking to earlier in the book (pages 52-53) we have the following passage:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This curious and seemingly paradoxical idea of the 'face' is that the heart of Levinas's phenomenology of ethics. When we encounter the face of another [our relationship] is 'straightaway ethical.' When I encounter another person, I find myself responsible for them - I find myself unable to do anything other than to respond to them <em>as</em> another person - whether I like it or not.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So the question of whether a fish "has a face" is about whether our interactions with a fish have this phenomenological character: Do we treat a fish as a subject of ethical experience?</p>


<p>Experiences on this tend to differ, both by person and by context. Many people are vegetarian precisely because they experience animals as ethically relevant, and I know one person who as a child became vegetarian in a way that they literally framed as not wanting to eat anything with a face, a category in which they included fish.</p>


<p>Personally, I don't consider fish to be all that ethically relevant (oddly, I consider animals more ethically relevant than fish and yet I eat animals and mostly don't eat fish. This is primarily for environmental reasons though). I will not mourn the death of a fish. And yet, encountering a fish out of water, gasping on dry land, it is hard not to feel sorry for it.
In the abstract, I don't care about the fish, but confronted with the actual reality of the fish and its suffering, it is hard not to experience it as ethically relevant, as having a face.</p>


<p>Almost (I may have been subconsciously inspired in my choice of book) entirely coincidentally, yesterday I was listening to <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/02/18/episode-34-paul-bloom-on-empathy-rationality-morality-and-cruelty/">the Mindscape podcast episode with Paul Bloom</a>, the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/2xCBEYd">Against Empathy</a> (which I haven't read).
His essential argument is that this empathic experience leads us astray from good ethical behaviour. It causes us to overfocus on the individual in front of us - this empathy is what causes us to treat the fish as ethically relevant even if we don't "rationally" believe it to be. It's what causes us to be kind to our neighbour but ignore millions of people living in poverty.</p>


<p>It's also what causes us to overvalue people like us and undervalue people different to us - it's much easier to be empathic to someone whose lived experience we can easily understand, and if we tie our ethics to our empathy then we will tend to prioritise those like us and neglect the Other.</p>


<p>Of course, one can bite this philosophical bullet and say that yes we should be rational in our ethics but also we should consider fish as ethically relevant. This is how you end up with things like <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/wild-animal-suffering/">Effective Altruists who are very concerned about wild animal suffering</a>. It's possibly they're right - I don't agree with their concerns, but I don't think they're in principle invalid.</p>


<p>I do think he has a point, and that a certain amount of rationality and deliberation in ethics is important, but I think too much of that will drive us towards utilitarianism, which is more like <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-18-11:10.html">policy</a> than the sort of living ethics that I think improves our behaviour in day to day life.</p>


<p>It's worth using rationality as a tool to improve our ethical behaviour, but <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html">emotion is key to effective rationality</a>, and empathy and the experience of the other is a crucial tool in navigating any sort of rational ethics.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Accelerator/Brake Model</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-20</dd>
</dl>


<p>I recently read <a href="https://amzn.to/2VOS9IK">Come As You Are</a>, a book about sexuality (primarily women's sexuality, but it mostly works for everyone).</p>


<p>It is by far the most <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html">annoying</a> book that I will nevertheless recommend. It was about 50% stuff I already knew (which I only skimmed but seemed pretty good), but the other 50% contained a lot of useful ideas that helped make sense of some things I only partially knew. It was also 100% annoying and I hated the author's writing style. I will grant I am not in the target audience for it (it is primarily written for women), but the friend who recommended it was a woman and she also hates the writing style so I don't think that's why, I just think it's objectively very annoying (especially if you're not from the USA).
Nevertheless, it was on balance very worth reading.</p>


<p>One thing that was particularly helpful was the brake/accelerator model for sexual arousal. </p>


<p>The model is very simple: There are two systems, the Sexual Excitation System (SES), the accelerator, and the Sexual Inhibition System (SIS), the brake.
The SES is what turns you on, the SIS is what turns you off.</p>


<p>If you're currently not interested in sex and you'd like to be, you need to understand which of these is at play:
It might be that your accelerator isn't being pushed by the current sexual context, or it might be that something is pressing hard on your brake.</p>


<p>Different people have different levels of sensitivity on each of the brake and accelerator. On average women have much more sensitive brakes (i.e. are much easier to turn off) and men have much more sensitive accelerators (i.e. are much more easy to turn on), but there's a lot of individual variation.</p>


<p>One of the least helpful things you can do is make a mistake about which system is in play. It doesn't help to try to turn someone on if their foot is slammed hard on the brake, and it doesn't help to try to make someone comfortable and at ease if they're already fine and the problem is just that the context isn't at all arousing.</p>


<p>The former is particularly bad, because pressure is one of the things most likely to activate someone's brakes, because it creates negative emotional association with the whole experience. It's also particularly common, because people (especially people who have relatively insensitive brakes, like most guys) often don't realise that the brake is a potential problem at all.</p>


<p>Since reading about the brake/accelerator model I've been seeing it everywhere. I think a lot of motivation is like this, where there are things that we really want to do (the accelerator is on hard) but also procrastinate hard because there's a huge ugh field around the thing and we find it massively hard (so are the brakes) and we just end up with the gearbox in our head grinding.
In the same way as with sex, trying to want to do the thing even more isn't going to help, and treating it as an issue of motivation will just cause one to build up even more guilt and shame around the subject, making it even more aversive.</p>


<p>This likely also ties in to the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a> model of growth, where desire acts as the accelerator and a lack of safety acts as the brake (and indeed a lack of safety is often a major brake activator in a sexual context).
Given <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-19-10:52.html">the context</a> in which I've been thinking about a lot of the personal growth work, it's probably not entirely a coincidence that these track.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on becoming a cis man</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-19</dd>
</dl>


<p>Please note: I ask for clemency and/or good faith reading of this post. This is stuff that is difficult to talk about without stepping on someone's toes.</p>


<p>Required prior reading:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1251790486341390338">Lexie's thread about why cis people should be allowed to think about gender too</a> (to be possibly replaced with a link to a blog post later if they write one)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/the-inner-sense-of-gender/">The Inner Sense of Gender</a> (this was in fact written based on a conversation with Lexie)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/06/on-not-quite-fitting/">On Not Quite Fitting</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In particular this tweet from Lexie's thread is relevant:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>And I have cis friends who have done introspection of their gender, and are now more sure that they’re cis – but talking about it gets shouted down as “you’re trans but you haven’t realised yet”.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I'm one of those cis friends, and I thought it might be useful to talk about this process given that it's not one that gets talked about much.</p>


<p>First off, some politics: My basic stance on transition is that if you want to do it, go for it, you're entitled to. There may be some sort of intrinsic transness vs cisness, I don't know, but I don't think it matters for the purposes of who gets to count as eligible to transition. Bodily autonomy is important, gender is a thing that it is good for people to experiment with if they want to, and people should be trusted to make their own decisions in this space.</p>


<p><em>In particular</em> while I would never suggest this about anyone in particular (and indeed don't have anyone in particular I even suspect of this) I'm morally certain that there are people out there who are at about the same point on the cis/trans spectrum as I am and have decided to transition. That's cool by me. It would both be inappropriate of me to police that, and also I wouldn't want to police that. It's just a thing that they're entitled to do.</p>


<p>I personally decided that transition wasn't the most useful route for me to go down and took an alternative path, but there's no reason other people should make the same decisions as me even presented with broadly the same experience of gender as I have.</p>


<p>Another political-ish note: I'm going to be disagreeing with some things some trans people say in this post. This can be dicey, but I feel reasonably confident in doing so because what I'm going to be disagreeing with his how they interpret <em>my</em> lived experience, not how they interpret theirs. Also, almost all of these are things that I've also talked extensively with other trans people about and largely agreed with them on - there's no broad consensus that I'm disagreeing with, we're just all figuring this out together.</p>


<p>Anyway, on to the main point of this post...</p>


<p>When I wrote "the inner sense of gender" I described myself as "almost certain that I am cis". This fluctuated a bit (both up and down) in the interim, and various people predicted that I would in the end decide I was trans, but I have largely largely settled on certainty that I am cis, at least to the degree that I think the question still makes sense.</p>


<p>One of the reasons I'm not sure it makes sense is that I'm increasingly unconvinced that gender is really a thing.
Many things are <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/gendering/">gendered</a>, and that the orientation of gendering is kinda defined by the statistical differences between some sort of "archetypal cis" men and women, but that doesn't neatly fall into saying that there is any one thing that we might call gender. Gender isn't a linear progression from man to woman, it's more like a big ball of biopsychosocial... stuff. This is a lot of why my politics of transition are basically "bodily autonomy, end of story" (the other part is that gatekeeping is not a thing that has historically covered itself in glory in this space).</p>


<p>But, to be concrete: My pronouns will remain he/him, I'm unlikely to engage in any major gender defiance regarding my aesthetic, and it's basically certain that I will never attempt any sort of medical transition (I'll confess to a certain amount of curiosity about the effects of hormones, but it really is just curiosity). To a very large degree I will continue to play the social role of man, and I will become increasingly comfortable with that (and also comfortable with ditching the bits of masculinity that I think are bullshit).</p>


<p>I still think if we had magic Culture level body changing tech I would experiment with other gender presentations, and I still think there's a decent chance that I might end up choosing a feminine or androgynous presentation as my default given that option, but I'd also like to be able to fly and the level of emotional significance these two facts hold is broadly equivalent.</p>


<p>What's changed?</p>


<p>Well, Lexie has been writing about <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2020/04/adventures-in-embodiment/">embodiment</a> recently. I've been part of some of the conversations that prompted that, and have been working on it myself too. I've, sadly, not achieved the same level of euphoria, but I don't think this is a gender thing I just think euphoria is hard emotion for me to access (I'm working on it). I've specifically been working on it in the context of Focusing and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">my work on feelings</a>, which has been extraordinarily helpful. I've also been working on it in the context of Alexander Technique and some of what I've been learning from that in the context of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html">letting my body drive</a> (one of the minor personal annoyances of the pandemic is that it's interrupted my study of this).</p>


<p>One side effect of this is that it has resulted in a great deal more comfort in my body, and reduced my dissociation from it. A lot of things that previously looked kinda like gender dysphoria turned out to be fantasies of "If only my body were completely different I'd be able to connect to it", but it turns out to be perfectly possible for me to connect to my body as it is, and to enjoy my experience of it, it's just quite hard work to acquire the skillset. well maybe it would be easier (certainly it's a common reaction to going on estrogen, but I suspect that some of that is genuinely just that estrogen makes it easier to connect to your embodied emotional state).</p>


<p>This also ties in to a lot of trauma. A thing that I saw on Twitter the other day (I don't want to refind the tweet because it's a general theme and I don't want to pick on her in particular) was a trans woman saying that one of the reasons why she knew she was trans was that "cis men don't typically experience their masculinity as traumatic" and... I'm sorry to report that this is not true. I'm not going to say that we experience exactly the same sort of traumas from it as trans women do (I'd be very surprised if we do, but I'd also be very surprised if there weren't some large overlap). Some of this is that <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">norm acquisition in general is traumatic</a>, some of that is that many of our norms around masculinity are really quite bad.
Going through masculinity training just <em>is</em> traumatic. I expect the same is true for going through femininity training, though the traumas are different.</p>


<p>Some of my specific traumas around this are that many masculine norms are very violent, both literally and figuratively, and are quite damaging to be coerced into. Current western masculine norms are also very homophobic. This is both a problem if you're not actually straight (which I'm not), and if you just happen to have some more feminine traits (I perform masculinity reasonably well in some ways and quite badly in others - for example I'm much more into talking about feelings than I think even the average woman, let alone the average man).</p>


<p>In general, gender non-comformance is punished (both by people of the same gender and the opposite), and almost nobody is perfectly gender conformant, so most people will have gender related traumas. Unpacking some of mine was essential for acquiring a healthier relationship with masculinity (and part of that healthier relationship is boundaries! I'm now much happier saying "No, fuck off, that's a stupid way to be a man. Shan't." to the worse bits).</p>


<p>The final aspect for me has been sex. I've been having a lot of it over the last year or two, and it's been very helpful. I don't plan to go into details here, but I'll note a couple significant features.</p>


<p>First off, lets talk about autogynephilia. I basically agree with Scott Alexander on this: <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/10/autogenderphilia-is-common-and-not-especially-related-to-transgender/">Autogenderphilia is common and not especially related to transgender</a>. I've had more than a few fantasies about myself as a woman. I've had more than a few fantasies about myself as a man. I am reasonably gender flexible in fantasy. It's fun and I don't intend to stop. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">Gender is sexy</a> and fantasies are supposed to be sexy.</p>


<p>If you don't realise that this is a thing, it can be very confusing, and the way that literally everybody talks about it (from "autogynephilia isn't real" to "autogynephilia is the main reason people are trans". Both seem to be obviously false) is extraordinarily unhelpful for making sense of a perfectly healthy and common experience.
People do a lot of things in fantasies that they don't especially want to do in real life, and turning this into a whole big thing is a great way to confuse people.</p>


<p>Secondly, a lot of gender related traumas are connected to sex. I don't want to go into details here, but they definitely were for me (it's less dramatic than you might be imagining from that). There is a lot of shame connected up with masculinity and desire, and acquiring a whole bunch of emotions skills while also having a whole bunch of sex was a great way to expose, confront, and defuse those.</p>


<p>Thirdly, for me at least having a penis is fairly central to my experience of masculinity (I'm aware that this is complex for many trans people, so treat this as a personal claim, but I expect it's a personal claim a lot of cis men would make), so uh getting comfortable with using it was a pretty good way of getting comfortable with masculinity.</p>


<p>Finally, sex ties in a lot to embodiment. In many ways the key to good sex is to embody well during it, so sex works very well for providing the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a> for growth in this space (of course, finding people you feel <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safe</a> with is equally important here).</p>


<p>None of this has added up to me suddenly being completely clear or comfortable with my own gender or body, but I'm vastly more so than I've historically been, and I've acquired the skill set and the understanding that allows me to continually improve on that over time.</p>


<p>So, at this point, I am reasonably comfortable in saying that yes I've thought about my gender a lot and I have concluded that I am a cis man, and that I am confident that the more work I do in this space the more thoroughly I will come to understand and embody that.</p>
