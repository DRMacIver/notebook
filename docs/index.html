<p><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html">All knowledge is connected</a>.
It might be tenuous, but the connection is there. You will probably learn something about cooking in studying ancient Greek culture, and you will probably learn something about mathematics by studying feminism,
possibly via some intermediaries.</p>


<p>A consequence of this is that whatever problem you are working on at the moment, you will never learn everything that might be relevant to it, because everything that might be relevant is... everything.</p>


<p>Fortunately you don't need to actually learn everything relevant to a problem to act. You can just flip a coin, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">or do anything strictly better than that</a>.
The goal of learning is often to <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2013/08/how-did-you-get-started-so-quickly/">learn just enough to solve the problem</a>, and often you're better off learning enough </p>


<p>As a result, this is a major <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-15:59.html">cut out switch</a> you need to install: The ability to reflectively go "I don't need to know this", and treat some areas of knowledge as black boxes that you're never going to open.</p>


<p>This requires learning the skill of working with black box knowledge.
Typically you deal with a black box in one of two ways:</p>


<ol>
<li>Learn just enough about how it works to use it and taboo understanding it. I don't need to know how the London Underground system works to ride the tube (although also don't ride the tube right now if you can possibly avoid it).</li>
<li>Ask for help. Find someone whose problem it <em>is</em> to understand this, and let them solve it for you. You may need to develop <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2015/02/what-are-developer-adjacent-skills/">adjacent skills</a> for their job, but you don't need </li>
</ol>


<p>If neither of these work, maybe it's time to open the box after all.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Inner Game of Celeste</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-21</dd>
</dl>


<p>I read <a href="https://amzn.to/2wszUzR">The Inner Game of Tennis</a> recently, on the recommendation of my Alexander Technique teacher. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it - both because it's always a bit weird when classic self-help books are actually good, and also because I am under a vow to never play Tennis so it didn't seem that relevant to me.</p>


<p>There was a lot of it I liked. I'm particularly interested in the chapter on competition, which I intend to write more about later, but most of the book is about how you relate to yourself,
and how to stop overthinking your actions and let your verbal mind get out of the way and let your body do its thing. Verbal processing is in many ways much smarter than the body,
but it is slow and not particularly good at coordinating the things you need to do to move in the right way as you focus on the task you're trying to achieve.</p>


<p>The Inner Game of Tennis suggests that we consider ourself as divided into two parts, a self 1 and a self 2, and I've <em>already</em> forgotten which is supposed to be which because thing 1 and thing 2 terminology is bad and only terrible people use it, so I'm going to call them the speaker and the doer. The speaker is your verbal self, the doer is your self that moves your body.</p>


<p>Particularly in Western cultures we tend to overidentify with the speaker, and think of it as being in command of of our actions.
In reality the opposite is more likely to be true, with the speaker being a thin layer on top of a much deeper web of decision making in the doer, but one thing is certain: The speaker has the ability to fuck you up.
The Inner Game of Tennis talks about how an overly judgemental and opinionated speaker tries to take direct control of your actions, and then shouts at you for getting it wrong.
The doer knows how to play tennis without the speaker's intervention, so the solution is to silence the speaker and act as a pure doer.</p>


<p>Naturally, this all makes me think of Celeste.</p>


<p>Firstly it makes me think of Celeste because Celeste is much like tennis in this sense:
If you try to think too much while playing it, you will die horribly, probably impaled on spikes.</p>


<p>(That's how tennis works, right? I haven't played it since I was about twelve, when I swore the vow, so my memory is a bit fuzzy)</p>


<p>Playing Celeste very much teaches you to act solely as the doer. If you try to think during a complicated wall jump and dash sequence, you will die. You have to be in flow state while playing Celeste if you want to make any progress.</p>


<p>But Celeste also teaches you to act solely as the speaker. Celeste levels are quite small, so you can see the route you want to take, and plot it out in advance. You don't have to, but particularly on the harder levels you will often want to pause and think about what you're doing, and talk things over with yourself.</p>


<p>Both of these parts of yourself are important to playing a good game of Celeste, as they probably are to playing a good game of tennis (certainly it wasn't the doer part of W. Timothy Gallwey who wrote a book about tennis).
The problem is not the speaker any more than it is the doer, the problem is that one of them is trying to run things, when a healthily functioning mind is a collaboration between the two. Your speaking self is good at planning, your doing self is good at acting, and these are not the same thing.</p>


<p>Celeste has more to teach us here, not through play but through its plot.
Celeste is ultimately a game about shadow work, and embracing our inner demons.</p>


<p>Celeste's plot centers around the protagonist Madeline's attempts to overcome her anxiety, by climbing a death trap of a mountain that wants to kill her at every turn.
Quite early on, she encounters a magic mirror, which brings out a part of her that sometimes gets called Badeline (the game never uses this term except internally, she's always referred to just as "Part of Madeline").</p>


<p>I've always felt Badeline was a rather cruel thing to call her, particularly as the game progresses, but in defence of the name she does spend a significant portion of it trying to kill Madeline, including by firing giant laser beams at her and throwing her down to the ground from on high, and generally being rather mean.</p>


<p>One of the things that she repeatedly tells Madeline is that she is not a mountain climber and that she will fail.
Again, Celeste is a giant death trap, so this is not an unreasonable concern, but she's very mean about it.
Badeline's role is to personify Madeline's fears and anxieties,
and to tell her all the things she should be afraid of,
and to give external voice to all of the negative things that Madeline tells herself.</p>


<p>Eventually after quite a lot of this, Madeline says the following to Badeline:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>You're everything I need to leave behind.
You're cruel, paranoid, controlling...
I understand now.
I don't need you any more.
I'm setting you free.
We'll both be so much happier.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>How would you feel if someone said that to you?</p>


<p>Anyway, this goes about as poorly as you might expect it to, and Badeline casts her down to the base of the mountain.</p>


<p>Later, climbing out of the pit she's fallen into (this is literal, although she's in a bad enough mood that it's also metaphorical), she encounters Granny, the wise old lady who lives at the base of the mountain (who is a real jerk). She gives Madeline the following advice:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>It sounds like she's holding you back.
Talk to her. Figure out why she's so scared.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Madeline follows this advice, tracks Badeline down, gives her a big hug, and tells her it's OK to be scared.
After that, they work together.</p>


<p>I don't imagine the authors of Celeste have ever read <a href="https://amzn.to/2J3N60V">Feeding your demons</a>, but there is a lot of similarity in the approaches.
Rather than treating your inner fears as demons who you should exorcise, you ask them what they need, and you give them love, and you turn them into your allies.</p>


<p>(Feeding Your Demons is a weird book and I like it but I don't know that I recommend it exactly)</p>


<p>The way Madeline talks to Badeline is exactly as bad as the way Badeline talks to Madeline.
You could argue that Badeline deserves it because she started it, but even if that were true it is unhelpful,
because the way the game actually refers to Badeline is more accurate: She is <em>part of Madeline</em>.
Madeline's attacks on Badeline are attacks on herself.</p>


<p>When you have an inner voice that is harsh and critical towards you, the problem is not that you have an inner voice, but how it talks to you. You need to <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/01/a-crash-course-in-having-feelings/">learn how have a better relationship with it, and how to talk to yourself in a healthier way</a>, rather than treat it as being intrinsically the source of the problem.</p>

<p class="subtitle">On feeling blocked</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-20</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm finding it significantly hard to write at the moment, so I thought I'd pull out that old lazy trick and write about writer's block. Or rather, the feeling of being blocked more generally.</p>


<p>An analogy I use for certain types of explanation is based on a fairly butchered Douglas Adams reference, which is that flying is easy. There are only two steps:</p>


<ol>
<li>Lift up your left foot.</li>
<li>Lift up your right foot.</li>
</ol>


<p>Being blocked often feels a bit like this. It's not that you don't know what to do. You understand the steps precisely. They're not hard. They're just impossible, because although you know what to do the world doesn't work like that. </p>


<p>Except it doesn't feel exactly like that, because they are instructions you know you <em>could</em> have followed if your lived world was different. Your world <em>has</em> been like that, but now it's not.</p>


<p>As I've talked about, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-14:06.html">I play Celeste quite a bit</a>. I recently also played through most of Hollow Knight.
An interesting thing that happened there was how much worse I became at Celeste as a result.</p>


<p>Why?
Well, the capabilities of your character are slightly different.
Specifically, certain capabilities were absent.
I kept trying to double jump and couldn't.
There were plenty of things you can do in Celeste that you can't do in Hollow Knight, but that doesn't matter, because I kept reaching for the ways of moving through the world that had become familiar to me and they weren't there.</p>


<p>I imagine it's a little like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVxaL8CAO4M">astronauts forgetting about gravity</a>. The world behaves <em>wrong</em> in some way.</p>


<p>Being blocked feels like this. It's not that there's an actual block, it's that you reach for a part of your brain where the words come from and it's not there. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-09:44.html">You can't run out of ideas</a> and you know this, but you try to follow the steps of the idea generating process and the world glitches and you realise you cut off mid-sentence and have been reading Twitter for the last half hour.</p>


<p>Switching between Celeste and Hollow Knight comes with a pervasive sense of wrongness. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yorTG9at90g">Movement in Celeste is very finely tuned</a>, and I imagine Hollow Knight has a fair bit of thought put into its movement parameters too, but they are <em>differently</em> tuned. These aren't strictly connected, in that you can imagine a game that is Celeste-but-tuned-like-Hollow-Knight or vice versa, but they're not entirely incidental either - both games are tuned so that each part of the game fits into a whole.</p>


<p>Blockedness is like this too. There is an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html">existential feeling</a> associated with being blocked: It is not just that any given action is blocked, it's that you can <em>feel</em> blocked. The absence of the capability is palpable.</p>


<p>In many ways the correct solution is to lean into this. Trying to force yourself into productivity when blocked is like trying to leave the pen in midair. The capability you are relying on just isn't there, and trying to pretend it is won't help you. Instead you should try to find something that you <em>can</em> do, that instead helps you recharge the capability you need.</p>


<p>Sometimes however there aren't really any good options, so you just decide to force a post out anyway. Either you find your way around the blockage, or you just accept that it will take you ten times as long to produce and you'll check a lot of twitter while you do.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Good strategies often fail</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-19</dd>
</dl>


<p>I <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/02/you-should-be-stockpiling-food-for-brexit/">stockpiled food for Brexit</a>. A lot of people were skeptical of me for that, and many people have said that the way Brexit played out proved me wrong and that it was an overreaction.</p>


<p>They are wrong and I was right. Stockpiling food for Brexit and not needing it was the expected outcome. It was never something that I thought I was likely to need, it was a capacity I was building in case of a low probability high cost event. The logic was that either food stockpiling wouldn't be useful, in which case I had a surplus to use up, or it would be kinda useful in which case it was a net positive, or it would be essential, in which case I would be incredibly glad I had it.</p>


<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3926VQH">Annie Duke</a> calls this fallacy <em>resulting</em>, and I think it's a rare instance of something escaping <a href="https://maartenboudry.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-fallacy-fork-why-its-time-to-get.html">the fallacy fork</a>.
Resulting is the fallacy of assuming that because you got a bad outcome you must have made a bad choice, when in fact you might just have got a bad outcome because you picked the option with a 60% chance of success instead of a 40% chance but it turns out that you're in the 40% chance world. Chance means that you can never perfectly control the outcome, and you should be careful not to let random chance inform your learning too much.</p>


<p>More complicated is that often good strategies you'll never even know if you succeeded or not. A lot of mitigations for COVID-19 are like this: You'll never know whether it really mattered that you were washing your hands, or socially isolating, because all you're doing is stacking the odds on a numbers game. You might get the virus anyway, or you might have never got the virus, there's no way to know. It's still a good strategy.</p>


<p>Capacity building strategies in particular are often a good idea, because they can be useful in unexpected ways.
I didn't immediately dismantle my Brexit stockpile when it seemed unlikely that we'd need it, I've just been using it as a buffer, so now if we do end up on pandemic lockdown we'll be well placed for food supplies while self isolating.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Safety as an enabler of growth</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-18</dd>
</dl>


<p>My friend Alex Chan <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2020/03/rich-enough-to-make-bad-choices/">recently wrote about how one of the big advantages of being rich is that the rich can afford to make risky investments</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Being rich gives you a safety net to make bad investments, which helps you find more good ones. Over time, the rich don’t just spend less money, they find new ways to earn more money. In terms Samuel Vimes would understand: they don’t just invest in a pair of sturdy boots, they invest in experimental boot-making startups.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As Alex points out, this ties in to my argument that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-22-11:37.html">you should try bad things</a>.
You can only try bad things if you have the resources to ensure that failure is no big deal.</p>


<p>For some bad things, this isn't an issue, but for things which have a relatively high cost (financial, time, or otherwise), being poor (or even just not rich!) blocks them off from you.
This is particularly egregious in the examples that Alex points out, where the lack of financial security is the very thing that prevents you from gaining more financial security.</p>


<p>This is a general pattern that repeats in many other contexts.
In order to grow, it needs to be safe to try things, and lacking the thing that you want to grow is what makes it unsafe.</p>


<p>This is often connected with learning. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">The fastest way to learn something is to do something</a>, but if doing something can go catastrophically wrong then you're not going to risk it, so whole avenues of learning are blocked off for you.</p>


<p>As well as financial, two common places this occurs are social and emotional safety (which can be tightly connected, but also can fail independently in their own way).
There's all the literature on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety">psychological safety</a> about how feeling safe in your team is an enabler of success, because people are more able to propose ideas and learn from them.
This ties in to what I was saying yesterday about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html">permission</a>: One of the key features of psychological safety in a group environment is the way it gives you permission to experiment and try things that might not work.</p>


<p>Another type of safety is <em>emotional</em> safety. For a lot of us the insides of our own heads are not safe. As I wrote about in <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/01/a-crash-course-in-having-feelings/">a crash course in having feelings</a>, one of the key steps to emotional growth is getting to a point where you can have feelings (especially negative ones) without being overwhelmed by them. As long as your feelings are dangerous to you, it's impossible to experiment with and learn about them, and this stops you from growing emotionally.</p>


<p>There are a couple of insidious traps that one can fall into that can make an otherwise safe situation unsafe:</p>


<ul>
<li>Overidentification with success. You see this a lot with smart people and learning. If failure is an indication that you are not smart, because a smart person would have succeeded at this, and you strongly identify with being smart, you will often struggle to learn because anything that fails is a direct attack on your self-identity.</li>
<li>Success as implying commitment. By doing something, you have demonstrated that you are able to do it, and now in future you can be coerced or pressured into doing it.</li>
</ul>


<p>In both of these cases, the cost of trying things is raised considerably: In the first, the cost of failure is made much worse. In the second, success itself becomes the costly thing. Either way, you have found yourself in an environment where trying things cannot be safe, because success has become too high stakes.</p>
