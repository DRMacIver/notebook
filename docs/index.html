<p class="subtitle">Probably enough probability for you</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-29</dd>
</dl>


<p>I found myself writing a new newsletter issue in which it would be really useful for readers to have a basic working knowledge of probability. I started trying to explain it in the middle of the issue, and this seemed like a bad idea, so instead here is an out of band explanation where I'll attempt to provide a decent working explanation of probability for people who are not already familiar with it.</p>


<p>Advance warning: In this piece I will be expressing strong philosophical positions, not all of which will be perfectly aligned with other people's strong philosophical positions on the subject. Obviously mine are correct and everyone else is a fool, and I shall show them all.</p>


<p>...which is to say, treat this as a useful way of thinking about it rather than necessarily a 100% definitive account that everyone else would agree with. My view on this is a somewhat pragmatic hybrid of two major schools of probability, which I think corresponds pretty well to what people actually do in practice, but I take that hybrid as central rather than treating one of them as correct and also grudgingly borrowing ideas from the other.</p>


<p>Another thing to note is that I am being very sloppy with or brushing over details. This is because what I am trying to convey is a rough sense of probability sufficient to get a handle on what it's for and how to use it. If you want to fill in the details, that's more work, but it's also mostly not necessary.</p>


<h3>What is a probability?</h3>


<p>Probability is two separate things, which are often conflated:</p>


<ol>
<li>The skilled practice of putting a number on some source of uncertainty, in a way that usefully improves your ability to work with that uncertainty. These quantified uncertainties are called probabilities.</li>
<li>A body of mathematical theory, based on certain idealised models of uncertainty that are only found in pure forms in mathematical objects, that nevertheless usefully describes and informs that skilled practice.</li>
</ol>


<p>Most explanations of probability start with the second, and end up a bit confused on the first.
In particular they try to explain what probability <em>is</em>, when in reality probability is not a single thing,
and is best thought of as something you do rather than something that exists.</p>


<p>In particular you end up with a lot of arguments about whether probability is a subjective representation of uncertainty or a feature of the world itself, which is about as sensible a thing to argue about as whether numbers represent weights or lengths.
Probability is a <em>tool of description</em>, and as such its use contains both subjective and objective elements,
informed by both the thing being described, the entity describing it, and the specific details of the process resulting in the description (e.g. how much work is put in).</p>


<p>Instead it is better to think of probability in a pluralist way: There are multiple notions of probability, each corresponding to a given instance of trying to quantify uncertainty, and the mathematical theory suggests various rules that a notion of probability should ideally attempt to follow, which may or may not be followed in practice.</p>


<h3>Quantifying uncertainty</h3>


<p>Here are several motivating questions, each of which invite different notions of probability:</p>


<ol>
<li>If you roll two dice, how likely is the total value shown on the dice to be greater than or equal to 10?</li>
<li>How confident are you that there are currently more than 67 million people in the UK?</li>
<li>How likely is it to rain tomorrow?</li>
</ol>


<p>A notion of probability associated with these questions is an attempt to answer them with a number. Conventionally, these numbers are between 0 and 1, with 0 representing "I am completely certain that this will not happen" and 1 representing "I am completely certain that this will happen", although often it's more natural to report them as a percentage between 0% (0) and 100% (1) instead.</p>


<p>Slightly more formally, a notion of probability for some set of possibilities (rolls of a dice, range of plausible populations of the UK, weather over the course of the day) is any method of taking subsets of those possibilities (e.g. the subset where the dice roll total is greater than or equal to 10, the subset where there are more than 67 million, the subset where it rains at least once in the course of the day), and assigning a number between 0 and 1 (or, if you prefer, 0% and 100%) to that event. Intuitively that number represents some idea of how "likely" that event is, but that is not part of the notion of probability, it is part of what we are using the notion of probability to try to do.</p>


<p>There are a couple reasons that I am emphasising this pluralism about probabilities,
but the first and biggest one is that these questions each have a slightly different type of uncertainty to them.</p>


<p>In the first instance, the dice are in some sense "truly random". There is an element of actual randomness in the world, and your uncertainty about it derives purely from that randomness (arguably you could perfectly predict the dice rolls if you had sufficiently good information and predictive power, but when I talk about dice or coin flips in this post please assume I mean ideal dice that are powered by some underlying source of genuine randomness like radioactive decay where you cannot predict it even in principle). This is sometimes called <em>aleatoric uncertainty</em>, meaning uncertainty deriving from pure randomness, but I'll avoid using the term much.</p>


<p>In the second instance there is an objectively correct answer - there either are or aren't more than 67 million people in the UK right now - and you could in principle find it out, but your knowledge is imperfect. You can e.g. google and get a population estimate of 67.22 million which suggests pretty strongly the answer is yes, but where do those numbers come from? How recent are they? Do they take into account Brexit and COVID departures? etc. Taking into account all of these considerations might make you less certain, but either way that uncertainty lives in your head, not in the world, where there is a true answer to the question that you can in principle find out. This sort of uncertainty is often called <em>epistemic</em> uncertainty, meaning uncertainty purely in your knowledge, and again I won't use this term too much.</p>


<p>The third example however combines the two. Weather forecasting is an imprecise science, but it's increasingly pretty good, especially with satellite imagery. Additionally, there are questions of general knowledge - e.g. if you have historical records you could answer with the fraction of times it's rained on that date - but at some point you start being affected by true underlying randomness and there is a limit to how well you can do regardless of how much knowledge you gain.</p>


<p>This discussion of these three types of things hopefully indicates two important features:</p>


<ol>
<li>These questions do not uniquely define a notion of probability each. A notion of probability is a way of answering the question, but there are many different ways of answering the question.</li>
<li>Some ways of answering the question produce better answers than others.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, suppose I answered 0 to the dice question. Perfectly allowed, there's no rule against it. I could genuinely be 100% certain that two dice when rolled and added together will never total 10 or more. Of course, I will then look pretty stupid when the dice roll a 5 and a 6. This is in some sense a <em>bad</em> notion of probability, even if it's a perfectly valid one.</p>


<p>I could take my best guess on the population thing (I'm like 95% certain that there are more than 67 million people in the UK right now. The 67.22 million figure is from mid-2020, and between COVID and Brexit I think there's a decent chance we've popped below the 67 million mark. 95% feels a bit low, but 99% feels too high). A "better" way of doing it would be to go out and exhaustively count every single person and report 0% if the answer is no and 100% if the answer is yes. Or we could run the survey that resulted in that 67.22 million again and see what it says and do the same, which is a bit lower effort than a perfect accounting but probably good enough.</p>


<p>Similarly on the weather forecasting, we could make a complete guess ("IDK, 50%?"), we could use historical data, we could use satellite data, we could use complicated modelling... the more effort we put in to weather forecasting, the better we should hope our notion of probability that we get from those efforts is.</p>


<p>But what does "better" mean?</p>


<h3>Well calibrated probabilities</h3>


<p>The only way to be obviously, definitively, wrong, is to assign a probability of 0 or 1 (0% or 100%). If I say something is impossible and it happens, I was wrong, there is no doubt about that.</p>


<p>But it feels like this is too low a bar to clear, right? If I say something is a one in a million chance and it happens anyway then, well, maybe I just got unlucky, but if my one in a million chances happen nine times out of 10, this starts to look pretty fishy.</p>


<p>A distinction I think it is useful to make here is that it is not that my one in a million chance estimate is <em>wrong</em> in these cases, it's that it's <em>bad</em>. I have not expressed total certainty in this outcome, so you could make a legitimate case that I am still technically correct in my opinion, but also in a practical action guiding sense my level of confidence is garbage and regardless of whether I am technically correct you shouldn't listen to me.</p>


<p>The problem there is not I made a one in a million prediction, or even that something I predicted as one in a million happened. Things that you should predict as one in a million chances happen all the time, because there are millions of such things. If I claim that a million different things are each likely to happen with a one in a million chance, it's pretty reasonable that <em>one</em> of them happens.</p>


<p>Say, for example, that I claim there's a one in a million chance of winning the lottery (it's actually much lower than this given a better notion of probability, but there's nothing stopping me <em>saying</em> this), and 50 million people play the lottery and someone wins. I would have said that each of their individual chances was one in a million, and the fact that <em>this person in particular</em> won is not evidence against that, because it could have been any one of the millions of others.</p>


<p>In fact, the problem my prediction would have here is that far too few people would win for it to feel well calibrated. If 50 million people play, that suggests about 50 people should win, and the fact that only one person wins suggests that my one in a million claim was too high, and that a better notion of probability.</p>


<p>This leads to the idea of the <em>calibration</em> of a notion of probability: My notion of probability is well calibrated on a series of questions, if when I assign a certain level of confidence to an outcome, the outcome happens about that often.</p>


<p>This is a little subtle, so let me expand with some examples.</p>


<p>Let's start with a series of (ideal) coin flips. Suppose, with each coin flip, you ask me to assign a probability that the coin will turn up heads, and I say 60%. You flip a coin, it turns up tails. This is not particularly strong evidence that my answer of 60% is badly calibrated - I said it was more likely than not to turn up heads, but I didn't claim tails was <em>very</em> unlikely. If I'd say 99.999% and it turned up tails, that would have been much stronger evidence that my notion was badly calibrated.</p>


<p>If, on the other hand, you keep flipping the coin, I keep saying 60%, and after 10000 coin flips it's turned up heads 4897 times, that's pretty good evidence that my estimate of 60% is off - certainly an estimate of 50% would be better calibrated. Currently the number that would be <em>best</em> calibrated would be 48.97%, but if I kept flipping the coin another 10000 times and got 5041 heads this time, the new total would be 9938, or 49.69%, at which point 50% looks better calibrated than 48.97%.</p>


<p>In some sense, for this very simple process, there is an objectively correct well calibrated answer that is that you should always be estimating 50%. This is because the uncertainty in it is "all in the randomness", and also beause we've supposed that by hypothesis.</p>


<p>Over a more complicated series of questions, the question is less clear, in particular because the probability might not be the same every time. If you ask me each day whether or not it's going to rain, and I answered 60% each time, you could measure the calibration in the same way, but suppose some days I answered 10%, some days I answered 90%, how would you determine how well calibrated I was?</p>


<p>One answer to this is what are called <em>scoring rules</em>, which attempt to score how well you do on a series of question. The way these work is that when you make a prediction, you are rewarded for a high probability if the event happened, or for a low probability if the event didn't happen. For example, a common choice of scoring rule is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score">Brier score</a>, where if you chose probability \(p\) you get a reward of \(p^2\) if the event happens, or \((1 - p)^2\) if it did not. In the extreme case where \(p = 1\) you get a reward of \(1\) where it happens and \(0\) if it doesn't (vice versa if you chose \(p = 0\)), while if you chose \(p = \frac{1}{2}\) you get a score of \(\frac{1}{4}\) either way.</p>


<p>(Some scoring rules may not work exactly like this, in that they aren't necessarily an independent sum of your score on each question, but the general idea remains the same)</p>


<p>There is a whole bunch of theory of scoring rules and what makes a good or bad scoring rule, but the most important part is that some scoring rules are <em>proper</em>, which means that the strategy that gets you the best score is to have perfectly calibrated set of probabilities, but different strategies will reward how close you are to being well calibrated in different ways. For example, the Brier score is fairly forgiving about if you occasionally said that something is a one in a million chance and it happens, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Logarithmic_scoring_rule">Logarithmic scoring rule</a> will penalise that comparatively harshly.</p>


<p>All of which is to say, as well as different notions of probability, there are also different ways of measuring how good a given notion of probability is.</p>


<p>There is one particularly useful notion of practical calibration that I'll talk about in a bit, but before I do I want to really hammer home something about calibrated probabilities, partly because even though I thoroughly understand it I continue to find it intuitively weird.</p>


<h3>Why are there multiple calibrated probabilities?</h3>


<p>Let's go back to the question of predicting rainfall.</p>


<p>Suppose, each day, you asked me if it would rain tomorrow somewhere in the UK, and each day I said 46.6% likely. This is the number <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/610677/annual-raindays-uk/">some brief googling gives me for 2020</a>, so this number is pretty well calibrated.</p>


<p>This is what you can think of as the "zero effort well-calibrated" notion of probability. It's well calibrated, but I've made no attempt to take into account any information available to me.</p>


<p>Now suppose I pay attention to if it's raining today. Say I claim that if it's raining today it's 60% likely to rain tomorrow, and if it's not raining today it's 35% likely to rain tomorrow (I have no idea if this is more accurate, I'd have to look at more data than I could find in 30 seconds of Googling, but <em>something</em> like it will be true - it's very unlikely that whether it rains tomorrow is completely independent of whether it rains today. Let's pretend it's right for the sake of simplicity).</p>


<p>The difference between these two notions of probability is not that one is better calibrated than the other, it's that one takes into account more work and information. It is more useful for action guidance (although still probably not quite useful enough), because we can have a better sense of whether it's going to rain on any given day.</p>


<p>("Is it going to rain anywhere in the UK?" is not necessarily particularly useful for action, mind, but you can imagine the same thing with more local forecasts).</p>


<p>An important thing to note here is that sometimes the day-dependent prediction gives a higher chance of rain, and sometimes a lower chance of rain. If it had always produced a lower, or higher, chance of rain, both of them could not have been equally well calibrated, because over a long series of predictions calibration means that they have to be right on average about the same amount, and if one was consistently higher it would predict a higher number of rainy days than the other over time, so they can't both be consistently right.</p>


<h3>The logic of probability</h3>


<p>As well as calibration, one way you can judge how good probabilities are is whether they make sense when compared to each other. Perfectly calibrated probabilities will always make sense in this way under various technical assumptions, but this is one way of seeing that your probabilities are definitely not perfectly calibrated and maybe improving them if it seems worth it.</p>


<p>For example, one obvious way your probabilities could be nonsensical is if you give an event that logically must be more likely than another a lower probability. The question "Will it rain in the next week?" cannot reasonably have a lower probability than "Will it rain tomorrow?", because every time it rains tomorrow it rains in the next week.</p>


<p>This will show up as being badly calibrated through a series of questions which asks both at the same time, because over a large number of predictions the number of times it rained in the next week must be at least as high as the number of times it rained tomorrow, so if the probability given for the former was lower than that for the latter you'd end up with one or the other probabilities being wrong.</p>


<p>(There are a number of reasons why this might actually show up as being the case if you arrange all the details right, but hopefully you can at least agree that such a prediction is silly).</p>


<p>The most important rule probabilities should satisfy is this: If two events are disjoint, that is they cannot happen together, then the probability of at least one of them happening is the sum of the probabilities of either of them happening. For example, the probability you assign to a die roll being five or six should be the sum of the probability you assign to it rolling five plus the probability you assign to it rolling six.</p>


<p>From this, we can derive most other useful rules about probability. For example, the first rule I mentioned can be expressed as follow: If whenever A happens, B also happens, then the probability of B is the probability of A plus the probability of B without A. The latter probability must be at least 0, so the probability of B must be the probability of A plus a non-negative quantity, and thus at least that of A.</p>


<p>Another rule is that, because the probability we assign to certainty is 1, if we assign probability \(p\) to some event then we should assign probability \(1 - p\) to it <em>not</em> happening.</p>


<p>I won't go into these logical rules of probability too much here, but it's worth noting that understanding them is often one of the most beneficial parts of learning probability theory, because they tend to result in fairly general rules of reasoning that you can use even when you're not using probability explicitly.</p>


<p>For example, we've got the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy">conjunction fallacy</a>, which people often fall prey to:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations.</p>
<p>Which is more probable?</p>
<ol>
<li>Linda is a bank teller.</li>
<li>Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>


<p>The correct answer is (1), because if (2) is true then (1) has to be true as well, but people often get this wrong.</p>


<p>(Although as a side note, I'm a little suspicious of this claim, and there are a number of critiques of it).</p>


<p>Learning to spot problems in your reasoning like this tends to be one of the reasons people are very into probability theory.</p>


<h3>From probability to expected values</h3>


<p>Often when we make decisions based on probabilities, we're interested not just in the probabilities of events but some number that depends on them.
For example, when we're planning a project, we will typically want to know how much it's going to cost.</p>


<p>For a given notion of probability, we can define the <em>expected value</em> of some score, as the sum of the score under the various possible events.</p>


<p>So for example, if we were to assign a probability of \(\frac{1}{6}\) to each possible face of a die when rolling it (which is, presumably, perfectly calibrated if the die is fair), the expected value of the roll is \(\frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = 3\frac{1}{2}\).</p>


<p>The important thing about expected values is that when you have a well calibrated notion of probability,
and take many actions, then the average actual value of those actions will be pretty close to the average expected value.</p>


<p>This is a little hard to justify in general and this post has gone on long enough as it is, but to see it in the specific case let's look at the dice case:</p>


<p>Suppose our probability of \(\frac{1}{6}\) for each face is well calibrated. Then over a large number of rolls,\(N\), typically about \(\frac{N}{6}\) of the rolls will have each value. Therefore the average is about \(\frac{N}{6} \times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) \times \frac{1}{N} = \frac{1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6}{6} = 3\frac{1}{2}\), as desired.</p>


<p>This argument will work for any similar situation where you're repeating exactly the same sort of action over and over again, but the claim is true in general (with some mild technical caveats), it's just harder to justify and I'll ask you to take it on faith.</p>


<h3>Practical calibration through betting</h3>


<p>This notion of expected values leads to one of the easiest indicators that you're well calibrated:
you can make money from betting on your probabilities.</p>


<p>Suppose I offer you a bet: If an event happens, I'll give you £1, otherwise you give me £1.
Should you take the bet or not?</p>


<p>Well, as a one off, it doesn't matter very much, but if you're presented with many such bets it starts to add up, and being able to make the bets well will lead to profit.</p>


<p>Now, suppose you have a well calibrated notion of probability for these questions, and you give the event a probability of \(p\). How much do you make off this?</p>


<p>Well, the expected value of your bet is \(p - (1 - p) = 2p - 1\), because if the event happens (probability \(p\)) you make £1, and if it doesn't (probability \(1 - p\) because your probabilities are well calibrated) you lose £1 (or "make" -£1).</p>


<p>What this means is that if you think the event is more likely than not (i.e. \(p &gt; \frac{1}{2}\)) you would expect to make money, and so should take the bet, and otherwise you expect to lose (or not gain if \(p = \frac{1}{2}\)).</p>


<p>More generally, if you make £n when the event happens or pay £m when it doesn't, you expect to earn \(np - m(1 - p) = p(n + m) - m\), so the expected value of the bet is positive when you assign \(p &gt; \frac{m}{m + n}\).</p>


<p>Why should you bet on events with a positive expected value? Well, because of the property that over many bets you expect the average value of your bets to be roughly the average value of their expected values. As a result, if you make a lot of positive expected value bets, the average value of your bets is positive, and thus the total value of your bets is positive and you've made money.</p>


<p>Now, I should add to this that actual practical gambling is much more complicated than this, and involves a lot of subjects like bankroll management. The above logic really only works as long as you are gambling amounts that are small compared to how much money you have in reserve: You only get to make many bets if you don't go bankrupt first!</p>


<p>This also isn't <em>really</em> about gambling, and I probably don't recommend gambling as a general choice (particularly against professional bookies, who almost certainly have a better notion of probability than you do and can make sure the odds you're being offered are not worth it), but it's true for general strategic choices too: Trying many safe things that have, in some sense, a positive expected value for you, and you'll probably do pretty well.</p>


<h3>Is all of this worth it?</h3>


<p>One of the big philosophical debates around probability is between "All uncertainty can usefully be represented as probabilities" and "Oh yeah, how certain are you of that?".</p>


<p>My view on the subject is this: You can always assign a probability to any question, but your probabilities will often not be very good, and whether it is worth the effort to make them better is highly variable.
In particular on questions that are very complicated and involve a lot of unknown unknowns, it's very unclear that thinking of them in terms of probabilities improves your thinking on the subject much,
or that "Making your probabilities better" is a good way to think about learning more.</p>


<p>There are a lot of arguments that an ideal agent represents all uncertainty as probabilities. This may well be, I don't have a very strong opinion on the behaviour of ideal agents, but I think idealising often elides the fact that these ideal agents have suspiciously godlike powers of thought and observation.
With actual real practical agents, quantifying your uncertainty that way may not be the best use of your time.</p>


<p>However, there are situations in which probability really shines. In particular when you are dealing with many similar questions which involve a mix of genuine randomness and uncertain knowledge, it is often very helpful to be able to do at least a rough and ready probability estimate of various things in order to get a feel for how to reason about it, and for some jobs and tasks that are at the cutting edge of working with uncertainty (e.g. finance, logistics, forecasting), thinking in terms of probabilities is a vital skill.</p>


<p>Even if you don't regularly encounter such situations, learning the basics of probability is often a useful thing to do, because it gives you tools for reasoning about the uncertainties of daily life, and generally gets you comfortable with working with uncertainty in a way that is hard to get elsewhere.</p>


<p>Is it worth it to think of everything in terms of probability? Almost certainly (about 99.5%) not,
but often it's worth learning <em>how</em> to think of everything in terms of probability so that you can then make the sensible choice not to.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How is laughter social?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-25</dd>
</dl>


<p>Random book prompt, from page 54 of John Moreall's "Comic Relief":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>First, the natural setting for humor, as for play generally, is a group, not an individual. Kierkegaard asked a friend, "Answer me honestly ... do you really laugh when you are alone?" He concluded that you have to be "a little more than queer" if you do. According to Henri Bergson, "You would hardly appreciate the comic if you felt yourself isolated from others. Laughter appears to stand in need of an echo."</p>
<p>It's hard to get into the play mode by oneself. Often when I expereince events alone, especially those involving setbacks, I don't see the humor in them until I am later describing them to other people. And even if I expereince an event as funny while I'm by myself, it's unlikely that I'll enjoy it <em>as much</em> as when I later share it in conversation.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Perhaps I'm a little more than queer (I'm certainly more than a little queer), but I don't believe this at all. I think laughing on your own is normal and Kierkegaard needed to read funnier books.</p>


<p>In fact I think I am likely to laugh much harder on my own than in company.</p>


<p>For example, the hardest I've laughed recently was at the following image:</p>


<p><img src="/images/piiswhat.png"/></p>

<p>I don't know why I find this as funny as I do. It's objectively very funny, but also I laughed to the point of struggling to breathe for nearly a minute. I was on my own.</p>


<p>I've similarly been in hysterics reading a Terry Pratchett novel, to a degree that I wouldn't normally in company.</p>


<p>In contrast, watching comedy, or having a funny conversation with a friend or partner, I will laugh regularly, but rarely to that level of intensity.</p>


<p>It does happen. My sister, L, and I have been known to trigger this in each other.</p>


<p>For example, a few years ago, she and I were sitting in the kitchen at my parents' place in the lead up to Christmas, having a long conversation. At some point the conversation was talking about how annoying it was that we'd both inherited the genes from my mother's side of the family that makes it very easy for us to put on weight (my brother is, in comparison to us, very skinny), and that we'd both like to be a bit lighter than we were.</p>


<p>At some point in this conversation, we looked down at our shared task, and our hands that were just absolutely <em>covered</em> in chocolate from the brandy truffles that we were making (My grandmother's recipe. It's like <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-14-11:44.html">processing redcurrants</a> but more delicious) and simultaneously cracked up.</p>


<p>L and I have done this a few times. There was a soup conversation that did it too, but you had to be there for that one to be even slightly funny.</p>


<p>It's fairly rare for me to be able to do this with someone (I think all my examples of this happening are family or romantic partners), and I think the reason is that in order to achieve this you have to have a fairly large degree of comfort and synchronicity with the other person or people, and even with such people it's not the norm unless you're currently <em>very</em> in synch.</p>


<p>What happens instead seems to be that although you don't laugh as hard in company, you laugh more easily.</p>


<p>Social laughter seems to obey a very simple rule which explains both these things: You should be laughing about the same amount as everyone else.</p>


<p>As a result, laughter in a group follows a rise and a fall, where some people "seed" the laughter, and it rises, bringing everyone along with them for a bit, and then as people stop laughing it brings the overall level down and people follow, everyone dynamically adjusting their level of laughter to be not too far from the overall average.</p>


<p>As a result, you tend not to laugh too intensely unless everyone is in synch, because you have to raise your intensity at a rate everyone will follow, but also you tend to laugh more easily because once someone starts laughing probably so does everybody else.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A simple model of depression and "depressive realism"</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-19</dd>
</dl>


<p>I was talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/fvathynevgl/">Vathy</a> about depressive realism,
and when I expressed skepticism about its existence they asked me to say more. I did,
and it seemed an unusual enough perspective that I thought I'd quickly write it up in a blog post.</p>


<p>So here's what I think, roughly. This is a simplified version of what I actually think (because what I actually think is a giant tangle of stuff I haven't fully figured out), and what I actually think is probably no more than roughly right, but I still think this is a good model that is helpful to bear in mind.</p>


<p>Basically it's this: Humans have all sorts of biases in their thinking. No matter what anyone tells you, this isn't bad. Biases are good, as long as you're expecting to make mistakes (and, I hate to break it to you, humans make a lot of mistakes and are going to keep doing that), because <em>not all mistakes are created equal</em>. If you're going to make mistakes, you want to bias in the direction of mistakes that are safe to make.</p>


<p>(See e.g. <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/02/theres-no-single-error-rate/">There's no single error rate</a>).</p>


<p>One of the ways that depression differs from healthy cognition is that it has a much stronger bias in the direction of inaction than healthy cognition does. If you see a problem, you can decide to do something about it or not. A depressed person is much more likely than a non-depressed person to choose inaction,
and as a result is more likely to believe things that justify that inaction (this latter feature isn't specific to depression - a non-depressed person who chooses action is more likely to believe things that justify that action. Motivated reasoning is a whole big thing).</p>


<p>As a result, a depressed person is more likely to get the right answer in situations where the right answer is inaction, and less likely to get the right answer in situations where the right answer is action.</p>


<p>In situations where the right answer is typically inaction (which can happen if you're in a dangerous environment which you have little control over, certainly, and as a matter of numbers this is probably more likely for depressed people) this will tend to mean that depressed people are more likely to be right than people who are neutral or biased towards action, but it's not that the depressed person is more realistic than the non-depressed person, it's that their biases are currently well adapted to their situation, and if the situation changes they would retain those biases and be less well adapted. I'm no more inclined to call this realism than I am to call a stopped clock accurate because it happens to be stopped at the current time.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Learning how to tell a joke</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>From page 10 of Ted Cohen's "Jokes":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Joking is a "two-stage" art, like music and theater. Someone must make up the joke, and someone must tell it, and these two jokers need not be the same. Those good at making up jokes are not the same as those good at telling them. Telling a joke well may require specific abilities, like being able to affect an Irish dialect, or it may require a subtle knack, like a sense of timing.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>He goes on to say that this presentation is particularly important because some jokes don't translate well onto the page, and illustrates this with the following joke that you are legally required to include in all books about philosophy of comedy or they take your license away:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Q: According to Freud, what comes between fear and sex?</p>
<p>A: Fünf.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Cohen is wrong here, this joke translates to the page just fine, because you can just read it out loud.</p>


<p>This routine on the other hand is an example of a joke that <em>actually</em> doesn't translate to the page:</p>


<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkCBhKs4faI" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>


<p>This both illustrates the strengths and the flaws of the two-stage art concept.</p>


<p>From a writing point of view, the joke isn't very good, right? It's perfectly well written, there's nothing wrong with it, but as written it's not funny, because the humour is entirely in the presentation.
This is why it demonstrates the strength of the two stage model: it's a very good illustration of the verbal skills of humour.</p>


<p>But it also demonstrates that the idea is something of a lie, in that you can't actually separate this into two stages. It's not just that the joke doesn't work written down, it's that there is no joke without the performance of it here.</p>


<p>This is, perhaps, an artefact of the fact that comedy isn't really about telling jokes, it's about performing routines, but I think this distinction doesn't work, and you experience the same problems with hypercontextual jokes that cannot be extracted from their situation.</p>


<p>What instead is going on, I think, is that for any given joke there is a <em>skill of telling that joke</em>, and some jokes you can teach that skill in writing better than others.</p>


<p>Another interesting example of this sort of skill is poetry reading. Some poems work written, but this one I've linked to before in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-06-13:53.html">Start from amazing</a> isn't one of them:</p>


<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFTASR8BMps" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>


<p>The poem is good, but the presentation of it is <em>very</em> good, and the poem rests on the vocal skill of its delivery.</p>


<p>Back in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-28-04:40.html">You can't write life down</a> I talked about the difficulty in transcribing oral stories, and this feels like another aspect of that. At the time I talked about how taking a Raven story outside of its cultural context would lose essential features of the culture that created it, leaving it in a diminished and abstracted form, but actually I think the problem is deeper than that: You can write down a Raven story, but I'm not sure you can write down how to <em>tell</em> a Raven story.</p>

<p class="subtitle">We must imagine the steelman happy</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-11</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm getting increasingly frustrated with the core of virtue ethics around eudaimonia,
so today I would like to put together a steelmanned version of something that is <em>almost</em> what they are saying and I think is actually true.</p>


<p>It's entirely possible that what I am doing is recreating something they actually are saying,
and that I disagree with them less than I think I do, but if so they have very much failed to communicate this to me.</p>


<h3>Do people pursue happiness?</h3>


<p>So here is, in summary, what I think virtue ethicists are claiming:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>People (unconsciously or consciously) organise their lives around a single goal, and that goal is happiness (or eudaimonia, but as far as I can tell eudaimonia just means "happiness but we don't like the connotations of that word").</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It is possible that this is a strawman and if so I would appreciate correction. </p>


<p>I think this is wrong, and the true version of it is a composite of three things that almost but not quite add up to this.</p>


<ol>
<li>People wish to be happy to a degree they endorse as appropriate for their situation.</li>
<li>They wish their situations to be ones that would make them happy under this endorsed happiness.</li>
<li>They take on ends that they believe will help them achieve this wish.</li>
</ol>


<p>Adding this up together you could summarise this as "People seek their happiness as an end", but I think that summary would be wrong in a way that the tripartite version is not.</p>


<p>(I don't think this tripartite version is <em>perfectly</em> right either - I'll point out some problems in a bit).</p>


<p>Let's consider the following test case: Someone you love has just died. You are, understandably, quite unhappy about this. Someone offers you a pill that will erase all the grief and will cause you to feel euphoric. Do you take it?</p>


<p>Some people will say yes to this of course. Even more people would (and do) say yes to something that merely blunts the grief. I think, particularly near to the event, many people would say no. Certainly I would.</p>


<p>My point with this thought experiment is not that there is a correct answer. My point is that the correct answer is not <em>obviously</em> that yes you should take the pill, and I don't think most people would consider it strange that it's not.</p>


<p>Further, this idea of appropriate happiness seems in general true. For example, I think most people who are not particularly sadistic would not want to be sadistic, even if it might strictly increase their happiness, because sadism does not seem like the sort of thing you should be happy about.</p>


<p>I don't think this is a controversial perspective in virtue ethics, but I think by binding together the ideas of "appropriately happy" and "happy" they have committed themselves to some weird takes where they have to say "Ah, but that's not <em>really</em> happiness".</p>


<p>Take <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-09-20:42.html">The problem of Susan</a> from the other day.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Susan thinks of her life as a happy one; she is married with children, and all is well except that her husband is frequently away on business. She discovers that in fact these absences were spent with a second family, and that he has divided his time between the two families for some years. Uncontroversially, Susan evaluated her life positively before the discovery, and no longer did so after the discovery. The question is: before the discovery, was her life happy or not?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This example is not remotely problematic under this separation: Susan was happy, but a version of Susan in posession of all the facts would not endorse that happiness as appropriate (even though Susan at the time might have).</p>


<p>I think one of the reasons virtue ethicists ignore this split is to some degree it goes away for virtuous agents, because one of the key features of the way virtue ethics treats virtue is that through the development of phronesis and the cultivation of the virtues one pursues (1) automatically: A perfectly virtuous agent feels happy precisely to the degree they would endorse as appropriate.</p>


<p>But note that the problem of Susan doesn't go away even if Susan is perfectly virtuous: The problem is not that prior to the revelation Susan was living unvirtuously, it's that she was deceived. A sufficiently intelligent adversary (e.g. a Cartesian demon) can deceive even a perfectly virtuous agent, and besides which a perfectly virtuous agent can simply be wrong by virtue of not being omniscient. I can be happy about the prospect of things that I expect to happen over the coming years, not knowing that actually the world is going to be destroyed by an unknown asteroid next year, and this is not a failure of appropriateness I just don't know everything.</p>


<h3>Do you even want to be happy?</h3>


<p>Another important way this split comes up is in therapy. People are unhappy, so they go to therapy to try to figure out how to be happy. And sometimes it's genuinely "just" an emotional issue, but more often than not it's actually perfectly reasonable for them to be unhappy and if they're really lucky they won't get a therapist who teaches them how to gaslight themselves into thinking otherwise.</p>


<p>I'm a fan of this piece in good housekeeping: <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a45386/gratitude-lists-dont-work/">Gratitude lists are BS</a>.</p>


<p>First she describes her attempts to be happier:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>After about 100 days of making gratitude lists, tens of thousands of dollars of psychotherapy, five different antidepressants, four months in an outpatient psychiatric hospital (where they strongly recommended we make gratitude lists) and myriad of high-priced alternative treatments, I had pretty much given up all hope of ever feeling better. Then my psychiatrist suggested I speak with a therapist in his office who worked with people with a history of trauma. Great, I thought, another opportunity to shell out more money to someone who can't help me. I shushed myself, told myself to be grateful for his offer — and to add it tomorrow's gratitude list.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This didn't work for her, because...</p>


<blockquote>
<p>My new therapist told me to write down everything I did and thought and said to myself throughout the day and send him the record each night so he could try to get some insight into what was really going on. I did, being sure to highlight the positives in my day to show him that I did recognize that there were some good things in my life. When I got to my next session, he told me the words I'd been so desperately longing to hear for years:</p>
<p>"Man, your life just SUCKS right now."</p>
<p>"It's not that bad," I said nervously, assuming he was either grossly incompetent or trying to trick me. "I have a lot to be grateful for."</p>
<p>"Really?" he replied, then proceeded to list off what he'd observed in my daily records: that I'd worked the overnight shift at jobs for years, which meant I barely slept; that the apartment I lived in was only so cheap because it was dark, cramped, ant-infested and falling apart; that my husband and I were raising a baby in one of the most expensive cities in the country, where decaying two-bedroom bungalows with no yards or parking spaces started at $800,000; that I had no family support system, since my closest relative lived 3,000 miles away; that years of working from home left me completely isolated with very few friends; that I was under extreme financial stress due to massive student loan debt; that I was a writer who had no time or energy to write because I was so busy trying to put out the fires in the rest of my life; that the few things I did have time to write got rejected over and over again; that I'd auditioned for over 150 commercials and had never booked one; that I'd blown my meager life savings on years of out-of-network psychotherapy treatment that hadn't worked; that I woke up in excruciating back pain every day; that I'd grown up in an emotionally abusive household where my mother encouraged me to watch "Pollyanna" on a regular basis while my father, who had combat PTSD and a traumatic brain injury, exploded in rages without warning; that I had to literally carry my baby over the passed out bodies of the homeless drug addicts who slept in front of our house; that my transmission had gone up in smoke four months after I'd paid my car; that all three of my cats had died over the past three years, and that my dog now had cancer — the most severe and fast moving case my vet said she'd seen in her 20 years of practice.</p>
<p>It all kind of sucked pretty effing hard, my new therapist said.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think it is reasonable to say that the problem here is not that she's unhappy, but that she is unhappy because of all of the problems, and that the natural and reasonable way to "pursue happiness" here is not to try to become happier but to try to solve the problems that are making her unhappy.</p>


<p>There is an argument to be made for acceptance, and I think there is a <em>strong</em> argument to make that one should ideally be able to cope with those problems without becoming overwhelmingly depressed, but I think either approach starts with acknowledging that yeah actually these things suck, and you cannot "pursue happiness" as a goal independently from how you navigate the practical things that are impacting your happiness.</p>


<p>I suggest that the very idea that people want to be happy is a confusion of how situations like this work, and it's a harmful one. People don't want to be happy, happiness is the feeling of things going as you want.</p>


<h3>Acting while depressed</h3>


<p>Another way the notion of "endorsed happiness" is useful is that one can treat it as action guiding even while not currently feeling particularly equipped to feel happy. i.e. depressed.</p>


<p>Often when I'm depressed I do things not because I feel any emotional motivation to do them, but because I know that a less depressed version of me would. There is a sort of wanting to achieve things that is possible somewhat independently of the emotional motivation for it.</p>


<p>This tends to be hard during long depressive periods, or without much extrinsic motivation to do things, but I do find that it's possible to just weather through a short depressive period because you intellectually still know what you want even if you don't feel happy about getting it, and can just act on that. It's harder to give it your all, and you generally feel tired and low energy, but it's not like the conceptual understanding of what you want to achieve is inaccessible, it "just" doesn't <em>feel</em> rewarding when you do those things.</p>


<p>This certainly isn't all that depression is, but I do think one of the key features of depression is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html">a restriction on emotional range</a>, and a key part of that is that you can often still fully understand and act on your motivational structure without feeling it.</p>


<h3>Speaking of...</h3>


<p>Speaking of the emotional difficulties and motivational structure, writer's block just kicked in. Apparently I'm still struggling with writing complete essays even when it's on the notebook blog, so I'm going to finish here and maybe continue another day.</p>
