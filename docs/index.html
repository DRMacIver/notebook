<p class="subtitle">Book Speedrun: Intelligent Virtue by Julia Annas</p>


<dl class="metadata">

<p>This is a book speedrun, where I set a timer for one hour and write a bunch of stuff inspired by a book.
The goal is to get one hour's worth of value out of the book.
It's far from a complete and comprehensive engagement with the book, it's just me flicking through the pages and seeing what comes to mind as I do.</p>


<h3>Backstory</h3>


<p>Often when I try to explain or justify virtue ethics to people, I describe it thus: Virtue ethics is what happens when you treat the problem of doing good in the world like you would any other skilled practice, as something that you have to develop expertise in in order to do it well. Being a good person is not simpler than, say, repairing a car, and nobody thinks you can reduce repairing a car to a simple set of rules, so why should being a good person be simple?</p>


<p>This is the book I got that framing from, although it's been filtered through and combined with a lot of other thoughts from other books and discussions about ethics.</p>


<p>I probably first read it because it's referenced in the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy's entry on virtue ethics</a>.
This page was authored by Rosalind Hursthouse, who wrote "On Virtue Ethics", which I have with me while I'm writing this and may also refer to.</p>


<h3>The opportunity for virtue</h3>


<p>From page 31:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Some of us grow up in bad environments which warp our ability to come to understand the virtues. Are we not excluding these people from the community of the virtuous for something they can do nothing about?</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>It is important, though, not to confuse the fact that we do not expect virtue here, which is reasonable, with the different thought that these people are incapable of virtue, which is mistaken. Most of these people fail to become virtuous because of the difficulties of their situation, not because they are not capable of it.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>The present account is not, then, committed to elitism about virtue. We are all capable of developing the kind of understanding that virtue requires. For some their circumstances make it hard for them to develop this, but we we have no reason to think that any are naturally incapable of it. It remains the case that, given the world as it is, not everybody does actually develop the virtues; but this is a problem for every account, not for this one in particular.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This seems like a reasonable and important position: Not everyone is good, and sometimes when people are bad, it is because they were raised in an environment which did not enable them to learn to be good.</p>


<p>But it leaves me with two questions:</p>


<ol>
<li>What, exactly, are we to do with this information? If someone is a bad person because of the environment they are raised in, but are unlikely to change that, why should we treat that differently than if they had every opportunity to be virtuous and chose not to take it? In particular for the purposes of interacting with them, their actual ethical character seems more important than whether they are culpable for it.</li>
<li>Why are her examples so bad?</li>
</ol>


<p>To elaborate on the second one I need to include some of the bits that I left out of the above: </p>


<blockquote>
<p>There are very many people in the world today who live in terrible conditions of poverty and violence (for example, in the slums of large cities) which makes it unreasonable to expect them to reflect on and criticize the lessons tey are taught by the role models they have, people who frequently (and understandably) emphasize the importance not of the virtues but of looking out for yourself, not getting held back by caring baout others, becoming used to violence and cruelty, and worse.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>We do not expect people raised on garbage dumps outside a Third World megalopolis to be kind and generous in their everyday behaviour, but this is, I suggest, for the same kind of reason that we also do not expect them to play the piano or do crowsswords. Their environment has obviously lacked the opportunities to learn and do these things, and because this is so obvious we do not assume that they are naturally unable to do them. The same holds for failure to develop the virtues.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I don't know, these don't actually seem like very reasonable expectations to me. It seems to me that people in conditions of poverty are more likely to develop a sort of community minded approach where they're all in it together. I'd want to see an actual survey of behaviour in third world slums - it's certainly not going to be a bed of roses, and low trust environments definitely exists, but it seems to me that often the worst environments for developing virtue are actually highly privileged ones. The sort that produce billionaires and politicians more than the sort that produce communities.</p>


<p>I could be completely wrong, but this seems to be an opinion formed on fairly narrow stereotyping of groups of people unlike the author, and I'm not wild about that. [citation needed] I guess.</p>


<p>There's also a footnote on page 32 that I don't like very much:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Paul Bloomfield has emphasize to me that the development of virtue does require a minimum of intelligence not possessed by, for example, people with Down's syndrome. Such people can develop analogues to the virtues, but not the virtues themselves. I think that any ethical theory has to allow that in cases like this there is a qualification to the way such people can be full members of the ethical community in so far as this is thought of as a community of active reasoners.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I don't know what the author's experience, but most people I've met with Downs' syndrome have been lovely. Can they reach the highest heights of virtue? I don't know, probably not, it certainly requires a degree of influence over the world that they probably lack, but I'm not sure that's a limitation of their character. To the degree that they are excluded from the ethical community, this feels more like a problem for the conception of ethics than the people in question.</p>


<p>I don't have a real conclusion to this section except to note that a close reading of this bit very much made me go "Hmm" and suggests to me the author's conception of ethics is useful to a much smaller set of people than I would previously have thought, and the defence of her conception of ethics as non-elitist seems suspicious to me.</p>


<p>Although fortunately I still think I'm within that set of people, so it's probably still a useful book for me.</p>


<h3>Is this ðŸ¦‹ a virtue?</h3>


<p>From page 97-98:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Being generous, kind, etc. carries no implication that you will be clean, hard-working, or witty; and none of these traits implies that you will be generous or kind. It is obvious that you can be clean, hard-wrking, or witty in a generous or ungenerous, kind or unkind way. In general, it is a good indication that a character trait is not a virtue if it neither implies nor is implied by central virtues, such as courage, but could be exercised in ways which are either courageous or cowardly, virtuous or vicious.</p>
<p>This is a way of working out which traits are <em>not</em> virtues; can the theory say anything useful about which traits <em>are</em>? Earlier I treated patience and generosity as vitues; on what grounds? They pass the 'filter' test of fitting into the virtues thoguht of as unified by the holistic development of practical wisdom. Does this imply that they are really just forms of a more basic virtue such as benevolence? What would show that they are forms of a more basic virtue or distinct virtues?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is all as part of a chapter on the unity of the virtues, which is a concept I continue to be a bit ambivalent about. The unity of the virtues is the claim that to attain the highest level of mastery of any given virtue you need to attain it for all the virtues. You cannot be maximally courageous without being maximally kind, etc.</p>


<p>I think what seems to me the strongest argument in favour is roughly that to the degree that virtue is the skilled practice of being a good person, <em>relative to a particular conception of good</em>, virtue is unitary in the sense that you have to in principle be able to do all of it all of the time. A given situation might elicit both the virtues of generosity and courage, and one requires the practical wisdom to navigate the combination of the two. If their is a virtue of courage and a virtue of benevolence, there is a joint virtue of benevolence-and-courage, and the exercise of any one of the individual virtues will sometimes be bottlenecked on the exercise of the joint virtue.</p>


<p>This is not, I think, the traditional conception of the unity of the virtues, and I might hold off thinking more about this for a future research speedrun on the subject.</p>


<h3>The skill analogy is better than she thinks it is</h3>


<p>In the chapter "Virtue and enjoyment", Annas argues that virtues have a trait above and beyond skills, which is that they have a strong emotional component.</p>


<p>From page 66:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>A skill can be exerised in independence of affective commitment; a skilled potter can produce pots, and a skilled plumber can fix leakes, in an unconcerned way. A virtuous person, by contrast, does not perform virtuous actions impassively and with lack of concern. The virtuous person not only does the right thing for the right reason, she has the right feelings about it. Someone handing out money, for example, but indifferent to the people receiving it and their responses, is not generous.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Actually I think this is entirely wrong, and misunderstands both generosity and pottery.</p>


<p>I'm slightly nitpicking here, and will delve further into the chapter in a bit, but I think this is an important point.</p>


<p>It's absolutely true that you can produce pots in an unconcerned way. You know what happens if you always do that? You produce shitty pots.</p>


<p>I'm a big fan of Radimentary's <a href="https://radimentary.wordpress.com/2020/11/24/pain-is-not-the-unit-of-effort/">Pain is not the unit of effort</a>, in which he makes the argument that if you're not enjoying yourself you're probably not doing your best work. This is crucial to the development of skill - people learn what Thomas Green calls a "professional voice of conscience" with regards to their skills. They've got a sense of pride in making a good pot, a sense of dissatisfaction at a bad pot, etc.
It's true that any given pot that they make they're probably not pouring their heart and soul into it, but in order to get to the point where they're able to make good pots without much emotional investment, they've probably developed pretty strong feelings about pot making.</p>


<p>Conversely, suppose you are someone who spends every day helping people, and you wake up one morning feeling super depressed. Nothing feels particularly good, you have no love in your heart for your fellow human, and you're certainly not feeling particularly benevolent. What do you do?
Typically you go out and help people anyway.</p>


<p>As with pots, you probably never get to the point where you're living your life like this unless you have a strong emotional investment in helping people, but also as with pots once you know how to help people skillfully you probably do not require the emotional investment of doing so every time your help is deployed.</p>


<p>I think probably she is still right that there is a different emotional component to virtues and "normal" skills, but I don't think that the mere presence of <em>an</em> emotional component is key.</p>


<p>She goes on to say:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>A learner, such as a child can perform a just action because her parents tell her to, and without caring about being just, or even resenting the whole business. As she becomes more virtuous she learns to perform just actions for the right reasons. We expect the process to lead to her giving fair shares, not being unduly influenced in friends' favour and so on, easily and without effort; eventually she may give gladly. Suppose that this does not happen: she learns to give fair shares and be unbiased, but continues to resent having to do so. Such a person is not just; there is something lacking that a virtuous person would have.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This may be a naive question but... does this actually happen?</p>


<p>My model of someone who does the right things for the wrong reasons is that they tend not to be very good at it, only do it when other people are watching, and do the bare minimum. People who aren't actually just and only pretend to be tend to be <em>very</em> obvious, because they lack the easy and automatic attitude towards it. They are often stuck at the conscious competence stage at best.</p>


<p>I would agree, in principle, that someone who goes around behaving perfectly virtuously but with malice and resentment in their heart shouldn't count as virtuous, but I'm somewhat skeptical of the relevance of such a person unless they actually exist. I think most people who can sufficiently maintain a habit of virtue are going to learn the feelings of virtue associated with that habit automatically, and this may be more of a bleen and grue situation than something that we need to take particularly seriously at a practical level.</p>


<h3>Lives worth living</h3>


<p>From page 147:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Is virtue even a starter as a candidate for making you happy? By now it's obvious that the answer is: probably not, on contemporary accounts of happiness as feeling good, getting what you want, and feeling satisfied with your life. But we've seen we don't have to think of happiness this way. If happiness is the overall end you aim to achieve by living your life well, then virtue does look like a very obvious starter, for it looks like a better idea to be loyal and sincere than to be disloyal and deceptive. It is absurd to think that we really have no more reason to acquire the virtues than not when we are thinking about how best to live. Rosalind Hursthouse has made the point forcefully: we want our children to grow up honest and brave, rather than shifty and cowardly, and we bring them up to have these virtues (as far as we can) not just for our own sake, in order to be able to rely on them in pursuing our own interests, but for their sae, because we think that they will live better lives being honest and brave rather than being shifty and cowardly.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>There seems something to this.</p>


<p>I started from the claim that virtue ethics was the skill of "doing good in the world", but perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it is the skill of leading a good life.</p>


<p>She goes on to say:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>When we are thinking of a happy life, then, it is just common sense that we want ourselves and our children to have the virtues.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I agree, but perhaps I'm not entirely sure why.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The intuitive place to start is the ordinary, commonplace assumption that a person's life will, to put it generally, <em>go better</em> if they have the virtues - if they are generous and brave, for example - than if they don't.</p>
<p>... we moderns have come to have a problematic conception of happiness. On the one hand, we think of it as an overall end to be achieved in living a happy life, and to this extent we can make ready sense of the idea that living a good life is a way of living a happy life.(...) But on the other hand we also have another, more passive notion of happiness - the more recent idea that happiness is pleasant feeling, or getting what you want, or being satisfied with your life.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I don't really understand why she thinks these are in tension. I don't think she's <em>wrong</em> necessarily, I just don't understand here.</p>


<p>In particular I think the thing that confuses me is that "being satisfied with your life" seems inextricably bound up with the question of living a good life? What does it mean to be dissatisfied with your life except to have judged it to not be a good one? This seems to tie in again to the ideas of <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia">burnout as acedia</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-03-08:59.html">moral disorder</a>.</p>


<h3>Conclusion and notes on the format</h3>


<p>Honestly I think I'm coming to the, somewhat unsurprising, conclusion that I cannot really do a good book justice in an hour, especially not one like this where I probably last read it in detail over a year ago. Certainly the format of randomly flipping through the book and writing based on prompts doesn't seem to be doing it.</p>


<p>That isn't necessarily bad. This still produces a set of interesting thoughts and writing. But perhaps the random book prompt is enough on its own.</p>


<p>I think I might in future try something closer to Lucy's original conception of the research speedruns, and might try a different format for book speedruns. I'm not yet sure what though.</p>


<p>Two questions that might make interesting future speedruns:</p>


<ul>
<li>Unity of the virtues: What is it, and is it true?</li>
<li>What exactly is the eudaimonist account of human happiness / flourishing?</li>
</ul>


<p>I'll probably try doing another speedrun on this book about each of those questions specifically.</p>

<p>From Intelligent Virtue by Julia Annas, page 106:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"A philosopher", says "Hume, "might select this character as a model of perfect virtue". It is always hard to be sure that we have got Hume's tone right, but if he is not being ironic here it is obvious that something is amiss. A yuppy lawyer who is great company at parties is a model perfect virtue? Can this be serious? What has gone wrong here? We do not need to go into Hume's account of virtue in depth to discover it (one reasonw hy the example is useful in the present connection). What the description of Cleanthes brings out is that someone may have a character that is useful and agreeable to himself and others, and still be utterly <em>uninspiring</em>, somebody tha tnobody could take an <em>ideal</em> of a 8good* person to be.</p>
<p>Let us compare Cleanthes with someone who really is admirable and inspiring and has served as an ideal to countlessly many: Socrates. Socrates' dispositions were of course not all useful to himself or his family; his commitment to searching for truth led him to neglect his own business affairs and reduce them all to poverty. Socrates' character was in fact useful to the Athenians, in stirring them to think about their values, but this was hardly clear to them, since they recognised this too late after executing him. Also, Socrates' character may or may not have been agreeable to himself, but it was certainly very disagreeable to others.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This passage follows a description of Cleanthes which makes him sounds pleasant but very bland.</p>


<p>When trying to be a better person, you can try to do less harm, or you can try to do more good.</p>


<p>In theory you can do both, but in practice doing good requires doing more and more interesting things, and this includes increased risk of doing harm. Also one has only so much time, and time spent working on learning to do less harm is often trading directly against time to do more good.</p>


<p>All of which is sortof irrelevant, because regardless of whether you <em>can</em> be perfectly good, most people aren't, and this picture Annas paints does feel like it rings fairly true: You can have pleasant and harmless people who are, ultimately, fairly mediocre forces for good in the world, and the ones who are out there actively doing good are often deeply flawed people with many problems.</p>


<p>I feel like a lot of people, especially on the left, have an attitude that people like this are a problem. This tends to come from a good place ("Nobody is above criticism"), but I'm not sure it's helpful. </p>


<p>Perhaps this doesn't affect the people in question (Although they did very much kill Socrates), but it tends to drive people to become very morally risk averse, and provides a lack of good role models for developing agency, because the people who are actually doing good in the world are more likely to be held up as bad examples.</p>


<p>I don't have a good solution for this. It's important not to let good works act as moral license for bad - e.g. just because someone saves hundreds of lives it's not suddenly OK for them to murder just one person as a treat - but I do think we need to start cutting people some slack.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on moral disorder</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-03</dd>
</dl>


<p>There's a problem I keep trying to write about and failing to write a coherent longer piece on,
so here's some rough notes on it.</p>


<p>Many people have emotional problems that are centrally concerned with <em>moral emotions</em>. Guilt, shame, pride (in the good sense of pride).
Emotions that are centrally concerned with the question of whether you are acting or living morally.</p>


<p>The central example of moral disorder is this: Your life is made substantially worse, on an ongoing basis, by feelings of guilt and shame, stemming from a fear that your behaviour is bad or that you are a bad person.</p>


<p>Something that <em>might</em> count as moral disorder is <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/burnout-as-acedia">Acedia-based burnout</a>, burnout from living out of line with your values. Not necessarily guilt and shame over your actions, but a lack of pride in your actions, </p>


<p>Non-examples of moral disorder include:</p>


<ul>
<li>Someone who has done a thing they feel guilty about, makes restitution, and stops feeling guilty about it (this is the emotion of guilt working as intended).</li>
<li>Someone who is a genuinely bad person but doesn't feel guilty about or ashamed of that (this is still a problem, but it's not what I would think of as moral disorder)</li>
</ul>


<p>If you're experiencing moral disorder people will probably tell you that genuinely bad people don't feel this way, your therapist might tell you that it's an attachment problem, or help you analyse where these feelings come from, and doubtless you'll find that they're part of some lesson you learned incorrectly or from the wrong people or etc.</p>


<p>But very few people helping you with this problem will consider what I think is a crucial question here: What if the reason you feel like a bad person is that you're a bad person?</p>


<p>It is important to be able to ask this, even if the answer is no, because you can't trust the answer "no" unless the answer "yes" is allowed.
If you are not able to acknowledge moral failings if you have them, you will keep worrying about the possibility because you can't just shove feelings of guilt away like that.</p>


<p>Also the answer is probably actually yes, sorry.</p>


<p>I think the most common reason for moral disorder actually <em>is</em> something like "being a bad person".
Moral disorder will often not shift in response to therapeutic means, because your emotional responses are broadly correct: Your actions are ones you consider morally bad,
and you are experiencing the correct emotional response to that,
so attempting to feel fine by persuading yourself that your actions are fine won't work because you're basically just gaslighting yourself.</p>


<p>Instead I think moral disorder typically comes from one of the following:</p>


<ol>
<li>An incorrect moral framework. A moral framework that declares necessary actions to be bad, or makes no allowance for human limitations, will leave you always feeling guilty because you cannot act in a way that you judge to be moral.</li>
<li>An incorrect understanding of the relationship between bad action and being a bad person - there is no option for doing good in the world that does not sometimes have you doing harm, and the appropriate response to a harm is to feel guilty and, if possible, make restitution. Importantly, the amount of guilt should be proportionate to the amount of badness. If you step on someone's toe you should say "oops, sorry" and then mostly forget about it. You don't need to go full "Oh no I am the worst I am a worm can you ever forgive me?"</li>
<li>Unhealthy emotional behaviours where you cannot deal with any amount of guilt, causing you to push it away, causing the level of guilt to rise until you can't ignore it, because that's how emotions work.</li>
</ol>


<p>(In case you're wondering which of these is me: Yes, all of them at one point or another)</p>


<p>There are definitely more problems than this, e.g. I haven't currently got a good theory for where moral disorder that is an absence of positive moral emotions come from, or what to do about it.</p>


<p>The solution, I think, is some combination of therapy and ethical philosophy (especially virtue ethics, which is the good one for this, and especially not utilitarianism, which is a central example of (1). Yes I've heard your argument about why if you do utilitarianism hard enough it's good actually because it becomes one of the moral systems that actually work. I'd prefer to <em>start</em> with one that actually works without having to do five dimensional chess to get to the right answer though) - working with both right action and the emotions that go along with it.</p>


<p>The details? Ah, well, I'm still working on that.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Book speedrun: On Humour by Simon Critchley</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>Lucy Keer has a thing she does called <a href="https://drossbucket.com/2021/09/17/research-speedruns/">Research Speedruns</a> where she sets a timer for an hour and learns everything she can about a topic during that time, writing as she goes. I've liked the idea for a while but rarely have this sort of problem where there's a topic I want to speedrun finding out about, but I do have a lot of books that I'd like to delve more deeply into (usually ones I've done a first pass on) and an intention to write more, so I thought I'd try a similar experiment of doing book speedruns.</p>


<p>The basic plan is to just write about the book for an hour in whatever mode takes me. A lot of it will be about random prompts from the book, some of it will be non-random thoughts on the book. It won't necessarily hang together in any especially coherent way. In particular it's not a book review, it's just thoughts inspired by the book.</p>


<p>The book I'll be speedrunning to start with is "On Humour" by Simon Critchely. It's a book about philosophy of humour that I found because Critchley was mentioned in Carr and Greeve's book about humour "The Naked Jape". It's short and I've read it in full, but at the time I didn't feel like I got a great deal out of it. It was locally interesting, but I didn't feel like I really changed my thinking based on it at all, so I thought it would be good to see if a speedrun could help with that.</p>


<h3>Structured Fun</h3>


<p>From page 12:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Humour is being employed as a management tool by consultants - imagine, if you will, a company called 'Humour Solutions International' - who endeavour to show how it can produce greater cohesion amongst the workforce and thereby increase efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p>(...)</p>
<p>...it is difficult not to feel a little cynical about these endeavours, and the question that one wants to pose to the idea of 'structured fun' is: who is structure the fun and for what end?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I must admit I've never run into this, and I'm very thankful for that because it probably wouldn't have gone well for me.</p>


<p>I have a couple objections to this sort of structured fun use of humour. I guess the morally strongest of them is the one that Critchley goes on to mention, which is that it's a tool of control by management, and trying to impose humour on people is interfering with their private lives.</p>


<p>It also reminds me of the whole problem of corporate mindfulness. One of the virtues of humour is that it helps cope with a bad situation, but when that virtue is being touted by people responsible for that bad situation, that seems intrinsically problematic.</p>


<p>I must admit though my true objection is that I bet such corporate workshops are painfully unfunny.
I have a real aversion to people trying too hard to be funny and falling short.</p>


<p>I am in fact interested in humour partly for its benefits to organisations, and as a communal practice among workers, but I can't help but think that any attempt to impose that from above is likely to do more harm than good.</p>


<h3>Humour's us</h3>


<p>From page 73:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>So, humour is what returns us to our locale, to a specific <em>ethos</em> which is often identified with a particular people possessing a shared set of customs and characteristics. A sense of humour is often what is felt to be best shared with people who are from the same place as us, and it is that aspect of social life which is perhaps the most difficult to explain to people from somewhere else.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In context this is talking about literal places - countries, villages, etc. But I do think this is more general - in "Jokes: Philosophical Reflections on Joking Matters", Ted Cohen talks about how contextual humour is - there is always an audience of people for whom the joke is intended - and talks about <em>hermetic jokes</em> which are those that you have to be part of a specific profession to get. I think humour can return us to a parochial "place" within their profession as well as their country. There are very much the sorts of jokes you tell as engineers, etc.</p>


<p>A shared sense of humour with someone is how you know they are "one of us", and helps define what that "us" is.</p>


<p>This ties back in to the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-04-12:52.html">humour test for expertise</a>, but in a very broad sense of expertise. Getting the national sense of humour is often how you know you're a native, fluent in the local culture.</p>


<h3>Humour's them</h3>


<p>From page 76:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>jokes can be read in terms of what or who a particular society is subordinating, scapegoating, or denigrating.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The fact of the matter is that a lot of humour is about people you look down on. In context, Critchley is talking about anti-semitism and other racist jokes, and what they say about our subconscious feelings that we are repressing (though of course they can equally say things about the conscious things that we are expressing).</p>


<p>I can't help but tie this back to a bit from the structured fun section. From page 14:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Anyone who has worked in a factory or office knows how the most scurrilous and usually obscene stories, songs and cartoons about the management are the very bread and butter of survival. Humour might well be a management tool but it is also a tool against the management.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is of course very different from the case of racist jokes, in that it is humour against those with power rather than those who are marginalised (punching up vs punching down, if you must).</p>


<p>Nevertheless, the jokes do have one common function: They are very clearly delineating the line of us vs them. If "us" is the group of people we laugh <em>with</em>, then "them" are the group of people we laugh <em>about</em>.</p>


<p>Whether this us and them division is bad is hard to comment on in generality - it seems like it's clearly sometimes bad and clearly sometimes a necessary coping mechanism.
e.g. you can tell how politics is going by how Soviet the jokes get.</p>


<p>I can't find the original source of this joke but it's been doing the rounds recently:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Boris Johnson visited a village in Cornwall and asked the inhabitants what the government could do for them.</p>
<p>"We have two big needs" said the village spokesman. "The first is we have a health centre but no doctor."</p>
<p>Boris whipped out his phone, talked for a while then said, "OK, =that's sorted, you'll have a doctor here tomorrow. Now, what was your other need?"</p>
<p>"Well, we have no mobile reception at all in our village."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Yeah, so that's how our politics is going.</p>


<p>While I have you here, here's a joke from page 21 of "Forbidden Laughter (Soviet Underground Jokes)".</p>


<blockquote>
<p>An old woman ran with all her might to catch the jam-packed city bus. "Thank God!" she sighed, having made it.</p>
<p>A citizen sitting next to her said: "You expressed that improperly, auntie. You should know that there is no God. You should have said 'Thank Stalin'."
"You're right, son, you're right," said the old woman in agreement. "Excuse me, I'm a little behind the times."</p>
<p>But after thinking awhile, the old woman asked:</p>
<p>"God forbid this should happen, but what am I supposed to say if Stalin should die?"</p>
<p>"In that case, perhaps you may say 'Thank God'."</p>
</blockquote>


<h3>Well you've got to laugh about it</h3>


<p>Page 101 has a section called "Humour as an antidepressant". His approach to this is very Freudian and I'm not sure I fully follow his argument, but on page 102 he declares:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I would argue that humour recalls to us the modesty and limitedness of the human condition, a limitedness that calls not only for tragic-heroic affirmation but comic <em>acknowledgement</em>, not Promethean authencity but a laughable inauthenticity."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I recently finished reading John Marmysz's "Laughing at Nothing: Humour as a response to nihilism", which argues that nihilism can be viewed as a conjunction of three things:</p>


<ol>
<li>Humanity is alienated from perfection (true meaning, perfect goodness, etc)</li>
<li>This is other than it should be.</li>
<li>This situation cannot be remedied.</li>
</ol>


<p>The book was a (ultimately somewhat unconvincing, though I enjoyed it anyway) argument that instead of, as nihilists traditionally do, regarding that combination as tragic, we can regard it as comedic, laughing at the incongruity.</p>


<p>Critchley's argument that humour acts as an antidepressant by reminding us of "the modesty and limitedness of the human condition" feels similar. We take the tragic and attempt to find it funny, perhaps by putting it into perspective.</p>


<p>This seems to tie in to the laughing at the people with power over you. That power exists and is other than it should be, but we can find it funny as well as oppressive.</p>


<p>At the end of the book, on page 111, Critchley recounts an extract from a French city that had been bombed in world war 2 and the concludes the book:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>For me, it is this smile - deriding the having and the not having, the pleasure and the pain, the sublimiity and suffering of the human situation - that is the essence of humour. This is the <em>risus purus</em>, the highest laugh, the laugh that laughs at that which is unhappy, the mirthless laugh of the epigraph of this book. Yet, this smile does not bring unhappiness, but rather elevation and liberation, the lucidity of consolation. This is why, melancholy animals that we are, human beings are also the most cheerful. We smile and find ourselves ridiclous. Our wretchedness is our greatness.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The epigraph in question is the following:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The bitter, the hollow and - haw! haw! - the mirthless. The bitter laugh laughs at that which is not good, it is the ethical laugh. The holow laugh laughs at that which is not true, it is the intellectual laugh. Not good! Not true! Well, well. But the mirthless laugh is the dianoetic laugh, down the snout - haw! - so. It is the laugh of laughs, the <em>risusu purus</em>, the laugh laughing at the laugh, the beholding, the saluting of the highest joke, in a word the laugh that laughs - silence please - at that which is unhappy.</p>
<p>Samuel Becket, <strong>Watt</strong></p>
</blockquote>


<p>Hey Critchley, what's yellow and equivalent to the axiom of choice? Zorn's Lemon.</p>


<p>Try finding some misery in that joke, gloomy guts.</p>


<p>As you can tell, I'm starting to lose a bit of patience with Critchley. If humour is, as he claims, an antidepressant, why is his book on humour coming across so morbid?</p>


<p>There is, I think, a thing that happens with a lot of philosophy of humour where you're supposed to make what is ultimately a light hearted subject very serious, and the easiest way to do that seems to be to ground it in human misery. Humour is cruel, humour is exclusionary, humour is a coping mechanism for the intrinsic misery of the human condition, etc.</p>


<p>All of this is true, but I do think it misses one of the most important features of humour, which is that humour is <em>funny</em>, and in being funny is fun.</p>


<p>I think this is me being a little unfair to Critchley and is in part a consequence of the thread I pulled on with these samples so far, but I do think there is a significant undercurrent of this in the book, and the epigraph and conclusion very much highlight that.</p>


<h3>Only as good as its jokes</h3>


<p>From page 66:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Any study of humour, again like anthropology, requires fieldwork and detailed contextualisation. Finally, it is only as good as its examples.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As I mentioned above, I recently finished reading "The Naked Jape". It's not an amazing book, but it's a lot of fun to read, and one of its virtues is that it has a joke at the bottom of every page.</p>


<p>I'm particularly fond of the following:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Two nuns are driving through Transylvania when Count Dracula suddenly jumps on their car. "Quick, show him your cross" says one of the nuns. The other nun shouts, "Hey, Dracula! Fuck off!"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/rikkhill/status/1432051001264156674">Previously introduced to me by Rikk Hill</a>)</p>


<p>And I think the difference between this and On Humour is telling. A study of humour might only be as good as its examples, but a book of philosophy of humour is only as good as its jokes, and honestly the jokes in On Humour aren't very good. There are a few that raised a smile (The chapter on humour of the body is entitled "Post-Colonal Theory", and I must admit that's a good one), but the book takes itself more seriously than I think is warranted, and some better jokes might have helped offset that.</p>


<h3>In Conclusion</h3>


<p>I'm sortof surprised by how this went, as I thought I liked the book, but I apparently have some quite negative feelings about it that I hadn't noticed before.</p>


<p>I liked doing a speedrun based on it, but I don't really feel like it gave the book a fair showing. Its was more like pulling on an interesting thread of the book, and that thread was certainly there in the book, but I don't think it was the whole of the book.</p>


<p>It might be worth returning to it later and doing another run through with a clear set of eyes and seeing if I get a different thread, but I will probably speedrun some other books first.</p>

<p class="subtitle">On feeling blocked, redux</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>Ages ago, when struggling to write, I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-20-10:33.html">On feeling blocked</a>, in which I describe the phenomenology of writer's block.</p>


<p>I've been really struggling with writing my newsletter recently, so I've decided to solve this with resuming daily writing, and it seemed natural to start by returning to the subject. A year and a half on I have a very different perspective on writer's block.</p>


<p>It's this: Writer's block is not wanting to write, or wanting not to write.</p>


<p>This may seem overly simple, but it's not. It just moves the complexity. Wanting is complicated.</p>


<p>In particular, often some parts of you will want to write, and some parts of you will want not to write, and the resulting inner conflict leads to writer's block.</p>


<p>In "On feeling blocked":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Being blocked feels like this. It's not that there's an actual block, it's that you reach for a part of your brain where the words come from and it's not there. You can't run out of ideas and you know this, but you try to follow the steps of the idea generating process and the world glitches and you realise you cut off mid-sentence and have been reading Twitter for the last half hour.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>That sort of distraction is exactly what (at least one type of) an inner conflict feels like. A part of you drives you to write, a part of you resists with some emotional judo and redirects you somewhere else.</p>


<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3l08rfl">On Writer's Block</a> by Victoria Nelson is a good book about the emotional dynamics of writer's block which, ultimately, boils down to a long discussion of reasons why you might want not to write. Typically they're some variation on wanting to write something that you don't feel able to, or that you feel scared about in some way.</p>


<p>In particular they often come down to trying to adhere to a standard that you don't feel you can be good enough for, or feeling that you should write in a way that isn't actually very good.
e.g. a lot of people get blocked because they're trying to write like they learned to in school and everything comes out boring.</p>


<p>I'm blocked on my newsletter at the moment. I don't entirely know why, but the symptom is that I have lots of unfinished posts. The solution is probably to write the newsletter more like I do the notebook. I don't feel able to do that, I don't know why yet.</p>


<p>In the meantime, I'm going to get back to writing even if I can't write the newsletter. Life is much better when I write.</p>


<p>The fundamental principles are the same as they always are. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-05-08:59.html">Make success trivial</a> then apply <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">the fully general system</a>. The fact that in this case the hard thing is something that I already in theory know how to do doesn't matter, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-12-08:19.html">things can be hard for lots of reasons</a>.</p>
