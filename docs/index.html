<p class="subtitle">Losing the story for the style</p>

<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2LYdFGs">100 Ways to Improve your Writing</a> by Gary Provost, page 57:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>There is no subject that cannot be made fascinating by a well-informed and competent writer. And there is no subject that cannot be quickly turned into a literary sleeping pill by an incompetent writer.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(This is as part of a section on style)</p>


<p>This isn't true, and the fact that Provost thinks it's true is heavily informed by sorts of things he writes about,
which tend to be of more general interest.</p>


<p>Part of the problem is that fascination is a question of audience/writing fit. In a similar way that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-08-08:53.html">you can't teach everything to a layperson</a>, you cannot fascinate someone who refuses to be fascinated,
and some people are just never going to be fascinated by some subjects, and you may well need to write about those subjects (possibly because of the people who <em>are</em> going to be fascinated by it!).</p>


<p>It's true that there is a fascinating story to be told about most subjects for most people, but often you shouldn't tell that one because it's not the important bit.
This reminds me of Zinsser's fucking terrible advice to tell a story about your engagement with the subject matter rather than the subject matter itself. There are circumstances under which that is the right thing to do, but those circumstances require me to care about you personally rather than the thing that I was expecting to learn.</p>


<p>It's certainly true that any story can be told in a way that fascinates the maximum number of people who are capable of being fascinated by it, and that style has a huge part to play in that.
I'm in favour of good writing style, of course I am, and of not writing in a style that bores your audience, but it's important to not overstate the importance of style: You can't <em>make</em> people fascinated by your writing, except by writing about a subject that they will be fascinated by when properly told, and sometimes that's not the subject you're there to write about.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Don't anthropomorphise fate, it hates that</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-10</dd>
</dl>


<p>From Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Fate. Fates, the: The Greeks and Romans supposed there were three Parcae or Fates, who arbitrarily controlled the birth, life and death of everyone. They were CLOTHO, LACHESIS and ATROPOS. They are sometimes called the 'cruel Fates' because they paid no head to anyone's wishes.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Looking up each of these individually:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Atropos (Greek, 'not turning', 'unchangeable'). In Greek mythology the eldest of the three FATES, the the one who severs the thread of life.</p>
<p>Clotho (Greek klothein, 'to draw thread', 'to spin'). One of the three FATES in classic mythology. She presided over birth and drew from her distaff the thread of life. (See also Atropos, Lachesis)</p>
<p>Lachesis. One of the three FATES, and the one who spins life's thread and determines its length. Her name represents Greek <em>lakhesis</em>, 'destiny'</p>
</blockquote>


<p>One thing I notice is how utterly inconsistent the formatting is on the three fates. Only Clotho references the other two. Lachesis has a different formatting for the Greek representation of her name.
That's by the by though.</p>


<p>(By the by. Incidentally. 'By-' can often denote something subsidiary or secondary, such as: by-election, an election in a single constituency; by-play, the secondary action in a play; by-product, a subsidiary product; and byroad, a minor road)</p>


<p>I've talked about <a href="https://amzn.to/2TCbsoa">Random Justice</a> before (e.g. in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-23-07:48.html">Proportionality and identity</a>), and about its point that one of the problems with lotteries for decision making is that they are a bit too arbitrary and impersonal in their fairness.</p>


<p>I still haven't got around to reading The Secret of our Success but reviews of it (e.g. <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/06/04/book-review-the-secret-of-our-success/">Scott Alexander's review</a> and <a href="https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html">Scholar's Stage's review</a>) exposed me to its idea that one of the historic functions of divination is to introduce randomisation into your decision making, and the personification of it as a message from the gods was part of how you got over the unfairness of it.</p>


<p>Given that, it's interesting (if not entirely surprising) that the personifications of chance are the <em>cruel</em> fates,
who you can't argue with.</p>


<p>It seems like often one of the ways we deal with things is to personify them - treat them as an actual person. This works varyingly well. Sometimes it drives you to do useful activities like divination, where the reason it works is unrelated to the claimed purpose driven by that personification, but sometimes is causes you to treat objective reality as if it could be argued with, and that doesn't work out so great.</p>


<p>"Facts don't care about your feelings" is a bad meme because facts are socially constructed statements about the underlying reality. But it's true that the underlying reality does not, necessarily, care much what you think of it - a volcano is going to erupt no matter what you sacrifice to it, a pandemic is going to pandemic regardless of whether you're bored of it.</p>


<p>I think part of the problem is that we're used to the giant impersonal powers that control our fates being made out of people. Politics, capitalism, etc. aren't necessarily any less prone to crushing us with utter indifference to our lives, but that's because it feels like that's because the people involved in those systems <em>don't</em> care. They could, in principle, be made to care if we exerted enough power over them (e.g. via protest). Whether or not that caring would result in systemic change is a bit more of a question mark, but the possibility is at least there.</p>


<p>A natural disaster has no such potential to care. Yellowstone could erupt tomorrow killing us all, and it really doesn't matter how problematic we think that is.</p>


<p>The temptation to personify is still there, and I think as long as we don't take it too seriously it's probably fine and maybe useful (omg coronachan is so mean), but it's important to remember: Fate is not cruel, fate is not kind, she isn't a person at all. The fates don't care about your feelings.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A Book is a Tool for Thinking With</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-09</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew">Talking About Machines</a> by Julian Orr, page 106:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>...documentation is not just a representation of the machine and its prescriptions but must be regarded as a mechanism in and of itself. A service manual is a device which someone constructs to convey information to someone else, and choices of inclusion and exclusion significantly constrain what can be done with the manual.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this is an underappreciated point, especially when writing technical documentation, but I would go further than this: A document is not just a device for conveying information, it is a tool for thinking with.</p>


<p>You can see this in, well, the current post where I'm using <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html">the random book prompt I described before</a> (although I actually picked page 107 and scanned backwards for context and found this passage was the one that I wanted to write about).
The random prompt isn't really "conveying information" per se (I've already read this passage and am already aware of the general theme), but I am using the book as a way to have thoughts that I wouldn't otherwise have had, by picking a random passage from it and writing about it, which causes me to have thoughts that I would not otherwise have been having.</p>


<p>As I talked about in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-13-09:56.html">How to read a book</a>, the actual physical design of the tool (the book) matters quite significantly for its use. If you just think of it as a document for conveying information, the information is all that matters, but the physical design constrains its usage. <a href="https://ramble.rixx.de/2020/06/08/a-blog-upon-the-deep.html">As Tobi discovered yesterday</a>, if all you've got is a library of ebooks you're significantly constrained in your ability to pick random passages from it (unless you create your own programmatic tooling on top).</p>


<p>Over the next few pages, Orr talks about the corporation's use of "directive documentation" - documentation which goes through explicit procedures that you are supposed to follow exactly in the course of debugging the (photocopier) machine:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The directive documentation is designed not to provide information for thinking about the machine and its problems but to direct the technician to the solution through a minimal decision tree.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>He then goes on to explain how this doesn't really work, because reality is irreducibly messy. The technicians use the documentation anyway, because it is often the result of knowledge they don't have (e.g. about the specific workings of a specific machine), but they do so in their own way:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>...a system that fixes the machine without either customer or technician knowing how or why is unlikely to be acceptable. Consequently, when the technicians use the directive documentation, they try to determine the purpose of the various tests, to understand what the documentation is testing, to know what they are doing.</p>
<p>This is not done just so they can reassure the customer; the technicians are also developing their understanding for future problems.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As I keep saying <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">the fastest way to learn something is to do something</a>, but often you run into the problem is that you have no idea what to do in order to learn something. Working through a preset procedure is often a good way to go.</p>


<p>A lot of people were complaining at me recently because I had the audacity to suggest that you could learn programming from books. Obviously you learn programming from doing programming, and the idea of learning programming from books is ridiculous (except for all of these books that are <em>not</em> about programming that you should read to become a better programmer, because apparently it's perfectly possible to learn about programming by reading as long as you pretend you're not doing that).</p>


<p>I suggest that one reason why people think this is that they are using books wrong. They have this wrong-headed idea that the way a book is supposed to work is that you read the book, you now have the book's information, and you now know the subject. Because this is not possible with programming (you <em>do</em> have to program to learn to program, there really is no way around that), it must be impossible to learn programming from a book.</p>


<p>This is, of course, obviously nonsense, because this is a fully general argument against learning <em>anything</em> from a book. Everything you learn has to be actively engaged with in order to learn it - even books which are pure information content you still need a much more active process of learning than that or the information will mostly disappear from your brain as soon as it enters, leaving only a vague sense that there's a there there (which is still useful of course - this is a form of <a href="https://jmestn.com/15485/naval-doesn-t-take-notes">reading to maximize your exposure to ideas</a>).</p>


<p>Instead, books about programming (or any other subject) should be thought of as tools you can use as part of your learning process. Just reading a book won't help you any more than thoroughly learning the details of a hammer will. You have to actually hit things with it. </p>

<p class="subtitle">A Guide to Starting a Daily Writing Practice</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-08</dd>
</dl>


<p>Apparently I'm now <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1265999121057546242">that guy who gets people to start daily writing practices</a>, so here's a daily writing about daily writing practices.</p>


<h3>The short version</h3>


<p>The daily writing practice I'd advocate for is to write at least one sentence, as close to every day as you can manage, in a location that gives you the opportunity to easily write something closer to a short essay should you choose to do so. Ideally this would be in public, under a pseudonym if you prefer, but if you can't bring yourself to do that it's also find to write <em>as if</em> it were intended for other people to read but to do it somewhere in private.</p>


<p>The rest of this post will be some guidance on how to make this work for you.</p>


<h3>What is the purpose of the practice?</h3>


<p>The purpose of the practice is to write every day and enjoy doing so. That's it.</p>


<p>There are some <em>additional benefits</em> of the practice, but the practice is in and of itself supposed to be an enjoyable thing which puts something out into the world that would otherwise not be there.</p>


<p>Additional benefits include:</p>


<ul>
<li>It will improve your writing skills, and your communication skills in general, by giving you a place to practice writing.</li>
<li>It will help resolve writing anxiety. You are probably much better at writing than you think you are, but writing feels hard not because writing <em>is</em> hard but because you have a lot of associated anxiety with it (school does that to you). By getting to regularly experience writing as relatively easy, you'll start to drain some of that anxiety.</li>
<li>You will likely find you have a lot of thoughts that were not getting expressed, and a daily writing practice gives you somewhere to express them.</li>
<li>Daily writing is a good place to think. It doesn't <em>force</em> you to think deeply, but it gives you a place where you can develop your skills for deep thought should you choose to do so. You will almost certainly become a better thinker through a daily writing practice.</li>
<li>By writing daily you'll start to notice themes across your writing, and you can begin to draw them out, connecting up your knowledge and thouhts better.</li>
<li>If you share it, people will find your writing useful. They probably won't find <em>all</em> your writing useful - the point of a daily practice is that you get to write stuff that's not very good, and that's fine - but I'm sorry to inform you that if you write every day over a sustained period of time (months, certainly, but probably even within your first week) you're doomed to write something that people actually like.<ul>
<li>This is good for them, obviously.</li>
<li>It's also good for you. People will say nice things about you. You will like that.</li>
<li>It may also spark interesting conversations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Success criteria</h3>


<p>Success is writing one sentence, almost every day, and feeling neutral to positive about having done so.</p>


<p>Most days you will probably find yourself writing more than one sentence. If you only ever write one sentence you should probably try to write more some days, but I find writing more tends to come naturally for people and writing only a sentence every day is probably a sign that you're not enjoying the practice rather than a problem in and of itself,
so I wouldn't worry about length too much.
Success on any given day is just the one sentence.</p>


<p>It doesn't even have to be a good sentence.
Success in your daily writing practice does not require any quality. If you're putting it in public somewhere you can explicitly signal that it is <em>practice</em> - a lot of us are using blogs like this one labelled "notebook" to indicate that the writing is just some thoughts that we're writing down. You can write high quality stuff if you want to from time to time, but it's not required for success.</p>


<p>You probably won't write literally every day. Missing a day is fine. If you're missing a lot of days (more than about one a week on any sort of recurring basis, say) then something is up and you should figure out what that is and what to do about it. Don't beat yourself up about it - it means something about the practice isn't working for you, and you should treat figuring that out as a practical problem to solve. Chances are you're setting too high a bar for yourself.</p>


<p>You shouldn't hate your practice. If you hate your practice, you're probably either setting your standards too high, or you're uncovering some uncomfortable feelings around writing that it might be worth examining (may I recommend <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-03-09:56.html">some useful emotion management principles</a>?).
If it's the latter, remind yourself that this practice is successful if and only if you hit this incredibly low bar, and that it's a good practice to do, and that you can set aside your normal standards for writing while doing it.</p>


<h3>Failure criteria</h3>


<p>I want to be very clear on this: It is OK to try a writing practice and give it up. Beginning a daily writing practice does not oblige you to continue a daily writing practice.</p>


<p>My recommendation would be that if after a month you have not been able to make it work for you in the sense above - i.e. writing almost every day and enjoying it - then you should quit. Additionally, throughout that month you should be actively looking at any problems you run into and trying to solve them. If you get properly stuck feel free to ask me for advice.</p>


<p>The month is just an arbitrary deadline. If prior to that point you decide that the writing practice is making you miserable, and you cannot figure out how to solve that, quit earlier obviously. I'd recommend perseverance if it's at worstnot quite working for you, but I'd also recommend trying to figure out why it's not working for you and seeing if you can fix that.</p>


<h3>Prompts</h3>


<p>One of the most important things to maintaining a daily writing practice is that there should never be any uncertainty if you <em>can</em> do the writing today, and the key to that is to have a good set of prompts for writing.</p>


<p>My favourite prompt is to find some interesting passage of writing, copy it out, and add commentary. The commentary can be any sort of thought prompted by it, or if you're stuck for what to say you can just explain what the passage is about, provide context, etc. </p>


<p>This passage can come from anywhere - something you've read recently, a tweet you've seen, a conversation you've had, but my personal favourite procedure is to use random pages from books. This goes like this:</p>


<ol>
<li>Pick a book, ideally one that you've read. I prefer using physical books for this, but it's doable with ebooks. I randomize the book selection but it might be helpful to set aside a favourite novel for this as the default if you don't have anything you want to use on a given day.</li>
<li>Pick a random page within that book, either by flicking through it or using a random number generator such as <a href="https://www.random.org/">random.org</a>.</li>
<li>Find an interesting passage on that page and use that (possibly continuing on to the next page, or scanning back to the previous one for the start of a passage). If nothing catches your eye, pick another page. If still nothing catches your eye, pick another book.</li>
</ol>


<p>I find this is a <em>very</em> reliable prompt for being able to write something even when I'm not feeling it.</p>


<p>Another prompt that I've been enjoying reading but haven't tried myself is that Lisa has been doing <a href="https://notebook.lisamcnulty.co.uk/series/drabble/">drabbles</a> - picking a topic in philosophy (you can pick your own area, Lisa is a philosopher) and writing 100 word explanations of that topic.</p>


<p>Another useful thing is to keep a file of things that you could write about at some point and if you're stuck on any given day, scroll through that file and see if any of them catch your eye. I've not been using this much recently since I started using the book prompt as my default, but it's been very helpful in the past and if the book idea doesn't work for you then try this.</p>


<h3>How long should it take</h3>


<p>You should tailor your writing to how long you have. If you don't have long, the prompts are important.</p>


<p>For me I rarely spend less than 15 minutes on it, and even more rarely spend more than an hour on it (this post is unusually long to write because I'm trying to explain something specific rather than just rambling on a prompt, so it might take almost an hour to write).</p>


<p>Key to this is the low quality aspect. Daily writing involves almost minimal editing. If you want an editing practice, that's separate.</p>


<h3>Things to watch out for</h3>


<p>The notebook blog is supposed to be an enjoyable thing that you can keep up indefinitely. It can stop being this long before it "fails" and in order to avoid it,
it's worth watching out for some things:</p>


<ul>
<li>taking too long over posts.</li>
<li>starting to put off writing posts, or not wanting to write them.</li>
<li>doing a lot of editing.</li>
</ul>


<p>The easiest way to have this is by writing too many good posts! It's very easy to let your standards creep too high, and you won't be able to sustain that indefinitely. It's good to write good posts from time to time, but you're not going to be able to do it every day.</p>


<p>My recommendation is that to counteract this you should deliberately half-arse your posts at least a couple days per week. Pick a prompt and do the bare minimum amount of work needed to fulfill it.</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>


<p>You should avoid any nontrivial activation energy for getting started and just start. Pick wherever to write is the lowest effort for you to do so, don't try to do anything complicated to get set up.</p>


<p>Social media is not generally a good choice for this. Twitter, or Facebook, are not very good for the essay format, and I do think it is important to write somewhere where you could write longer posts if you wanted to.</p>


<p>My ideal recommendation is to start a blog or a newsletter somewhere. I've been enjoying Substack for <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/">my newsletter</a>. If you're at all programmery doing a static site on GitHub pages is also a good way to go, otherwise <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> is a good option. <a href="https://reading.supply/">reading.supply</a> seems nice but I haven't used it (and it's currently difficult to subscribe to if you've not got an account there, but that may be a feature depending on how shy you're feeling).</p>


<p>Also, you should get started now. Step away from this post, set up a place to write, and then write something.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A Meta For Computers</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>I use metaphors of legacy code and refactoring a lot, and this works very well but is comprehensible more or less in direct proportion to how well you understand software development.
It turns out that a lot of people I know understand software development well enough to benefit from this, but by no means all.</p>


<p>I was trying to think about how to explain this to other people, and I ended up with what I think is a reasonably pleasing way to explain how computers and software work in general.</p>


<p>So, here's the metaphor I want to use: Think of a computer as a kind of archive, but you're not allowed in to the archive, you can only access it through someone at the front desk. We'll call him Steve.</p>


<p>Behind the scenes the archive has a bunch of people working in it. When you ask Steve to do something, he doesn't do it himself, he just passes on appropriate orders to the people working there, they carry out the orders, bring something back to him, and he hands it over to you. Steve is not the one who is fulfilling your commands, he's just the interface to it.</p>


<p>Now due to regulations, the archive runs on <em>very</em> strict rules. There's a rule for everything, a protocol to every request. Steve and the workers in it <em>will</em> not violate the rules, no matter how much you plead. It's more than their job's worth, don't you know?</p>


<p>As long as you stick within the scenarios the rules are designed for this is mostly pretty well.
You bring Steve a document and ask him to file it. He says "Certainly, I'll file this as document XYZ-1234" or some other ID, hands it to the a clerk, who files it appropriately.
When you want it back you say "Steve, can I have document XYZ-1234?" and he passes on the request to a relevant clerk, they fetch the document and hand it back to you. The system is working as intended.</p>


<p>Suppose one day you come in and you've forgotten the ID of the document you want. "Steve, can I have the document I gave you on Wednesday?".
Steve can't do that. "The document I gave you on Wednesday" is not a request that the system has rules for, so he's not allowed to fulfill it.</p>


<p>Eventually, after consulting the rule book as to what sort of queries you <em>are</em> allowed to make, you ask Steve to give you all documents filed by you on 2020-06-03. You filed only one document on that date (the Wednesday in question), so Steve hands you the document on Wednesday.</p>


<p>This is what interacting with a computer is like: The computer is a system of rules that is there to do things you find useful, but everything you want to do with it has to be thought of and accounted for in advance.
Sometimes the rules are so complicated as to <em>seem</em> more sophisticated than that, but they're not they're just a really complicated rule system. Sometimes the rules contain rules for changing the rules (this is what programming is), but you're still constrained to follow the rules.</p>


<p>The fact that they're rules doesn't mean they're perfectly predictable of course. You can have rules for things like "Give me a random file" which involves a clerk drawing a card, rolling dice, etc. You can also have rules like "Send two clerks to do A and B and give me whichever result comes back" and the result will depend on which workers implement the task, whether they're having good days, etc. The rules can, in general, <em>underdetermine</em> the result, but they do specify how the result must be obtained.</p>


<h3>What does a crash look like?</h3>


<p>One day you go to Steve and you say "Steve, can you attach this note to document QP-567?". As per usual, Steve sends a Clerk off to get the document. As he goes through the procedure to attach the note to it for you, he pauses, a horrified look crosses his face, and he breaks down crying, without attaching the note.</p>


<p>You ask him what's wrong, but he can't tell you: There's no rule for that. Also, Steve now won't answer any of your other questions, because the rules don't allow him to proceed until he's completed your request.</p>


<p>Eventually, frustrated, you go to Kim, the administrator, who is in charge of managing the rules of the archive and ask them to look into it. After a while of investigating (they have a bunch of special privileges that allow them to ask Steve WTF is going on) they tell you that the problem is that the document you've asked for doesn't have an associated date or author, and that as part of their procedures Steve has to record those as part of the log of your request when handing you a document. The document you attempted to attach a note to came from before they were recording that information on entry, and the recording rules came in after recording that information was mandatory, so don't account for this possibility.</p>


<p>Kim updates the rules and tells you they've fixed the problem. You ask Steve to attach the note to QP-567 again. He informs you that you don't have permission to do that.</p>


<p>You are less than impressed by this response and ask Kim what's up with it. They inform you that this seemed like the logical fix: If attaching a note a document requires this information, you must not be allowed to attach notes to documents that lack it. You patiently explain that this is all very well but you need to attach the note to the document from and don't actually care about their recording requirements.
Why is that rule even there?</p>


<p>Kim consults Janet, the interface to their archive where they record information about the changes in the rules of the archive you want to manage, and after a number of queries comes to the following conclusion: The recording requirement doesn't seem to have been introduced for any particularly good reason, but all sorts of <em>other</em> rules and procedures depend on it now, so it's really hard to change.</p>


<p>After a bit of back and forth and arguing about how important it is for you to be able to actually add notes to documents in the archive anyway, you hit on a solution: When attaching a note to such a document, Steve will record it as having been authored by "Unknown" at the date of the creation of the archive.</p>


<p>You can now attach the note to the document.</p>


<h3>What does legacy code look like?</h3>


<p>One day you request a document and you get the wrong one back.</p>


<p>You go to Kim and ask what's up with that. "Jesus, I have no idea, document retrieval is <em>complicated</em>."</p>


<p>You express a certain amount of surprise about this. From your perspective you just give Steve the ID and he comes back to you with a document. What could be simpler?</p>


<p>So Kim sits you down and explains to you the realities of archiving.</p>


<p>First you have to understand, an archive is not some abstract place. These documents you're handing to Steve? They have to <em>go</em> somewhere. There are all these big rooms where the documents have to literally, physically, go. Although those rooms are big, there are a lot of documents, so sometimes rooms fill up and you have to build other rooms.</p>


<p>So, when you look up a document, first someone has to look up in an index somewhere to find out what room to look in for it. This was reasonable simple up until a couple of years ago when the size of the index got too large for the room they were storing it in, so now the index is split across multiple rooms. So first they have a procedure to figure out which index to look at.</p>


<p>This is all made more complicated by the fact that the ID system has changed multiple times over the lifetime of the archive, so depending on which room it's in and what ID system was in use when the item was entered into the archive you need different ways of looking it up (some rooms the documents are stored ordered by author, some by title, some by publication year, and this affects how you find a document there and is taken into account in the ID).</p>


<p>In order to illustrate their point, Kim shows you the rules for looking up a document. They span three books. They are not small books.</p>


<p>Eventually after making yourself enough of a nuisance, Kim acknowledges that yes of the dozen things they had to do today obviously your document is the most important thing they could be working on,
and so they go to Steve and ask him to walk them through how exactly the document was retrieved.</p>


<p>Eventually, after much deliberation, they determine that the problem is that it was looked up using the wrong ID system.
You see, the way they determine which ID system to use is based on the date the document was entered into the archive. If there is no entry date, they try all of the different ways in which it could have been entered (there are three from before the system started requiring recording the entry date) and if there is more than one document they ask the person requesting the document to resolve the ambiguity.</p>


<p>But the last time someone atached a note to this document, Steve noticed it didn't have an entry date, so as per the new rules implemented in response to your complaint before, set its entry date to the beginning of the archive. So now there is no ambiguity in what ID system it is using, but unfortunately it's a much more recent document than that, so it's unambiguously using the wrong one.</p>
