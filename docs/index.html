<p class="subtitle">You open one of the 999 boxes on this floor and find...</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-11</dd>
</dl>


<p>Yesterday evening I was, for reasons, talking to someone and coming up with strange and unsettling things you could do with surplus rooms in a house. Here are some of my entries:</p>


<ul>
<li>One room has all the walls mirrored but one of the mirrors is secretly a screen and doesn't flip the image.</li>
<li>One room is perfectly normal but for some reason the ceiling is a map of England. There is a "You are here" label on it. The label is, confusingly, pointing at a completely different city.</li>
<li>There is a pool room. We couldn't decide whether this was the sort with water or the sort where you hit a ball with a stick, so it's both.</li>
<li>A room with a microphone and speakers that generate an artificial echo that is on very slightly too long a delay to be comfortable, and also sometimes you'd swear there's another voice in the background.</li>
<li>An entire room which is just a giant playground for cats.</li>
<li>A room whose walls are an ant farm.</li>
</ul>


<p>I could keep going pretty much indefinitely.</p>


<ul>
<li>One room has many cupboards, but all the cupboards doors look identical to doors to other rooms.</li>
<li>A room with a window in it that on closer inspection looks out on the wrong side of the house.</li>
<li>A perfectly normal living room in which all the furniture is for some reason clad in brightly coloured padded foam.</li>
<li>A room with central heating that automatically adjusts to a temperature the current occupants will find uncomfortable.</li>
<li>A room where all the walls are lined with drawers.</li>
<li>A room that generates a slightly unpleasant noise every time someone talks, gradually training people into silence.</li>
<li>A room that is perfectly normal but all the wall sockets are that of a different country.</li>
</ul>


<p>Each of these took me no more than a couple of seconds to come up with, and I feel like I could do this for longer, though I expect I'd start to get a little repetitive at the 100 mark.</p>


<ul>
<li>A room whose walls are all different colours. When the room is occupied and nobody is looking at a particular wall, its colour changes very slightly.</li>
<li>A room whose walls "wrap around" visually so that looking at a wall you see the view from the opposite wall, stretching out into infinity.</li>
</ul>


<p>There's only so much you can do with walls.</p>


<ul>
<li>A reading room with several comfy chairs. Next to each is a small table with a pile of books on it. When you take a book off the pile, another one emerges from underneath to replenish the pile. Putting a book back on the pile does not cause any books to disappear.</li>
<li>Two identical rooms in separate parts of the house that are "sound linked". A cunning arrangement of microphones and directed speakers means that not only do you hear everything happening in the other room, you also hear it as if it were coming from the corresponding place in this room.</li>
</ul>


<p>I'm using screens and speakers a lot, but that's because they're so versatile. I'm sure I could do without.</p>


<ul>
<li>A room whose walls and floors are a giant jigsaw puzzle. The pieces are lightly magnetic so they stick to the wall easily. The puzzle is of the view you would see from the outside of the house looking in that direction.</li>
<li>A room where all the furniture is metal and is very gently electrified so you get a light tingle when you touch it.</li>
<li>A room filled with tiny ballerina dolls. As long as the lights are off, they will dance.</li>
</ul>


<p>The reason I'm able to do this is that this sort of idea generation is something I just practiced a lot as a child. It's easy to the point of being slightly surprising that other people can't do this so easily.
"How do you come up with all of these things?" "IDK I just think about the subject matter and reach for the place where ideas come from".</p>


<p>This sort of example is particularly easy because "normal" is so tightly constrained. Everyone does most things in broadly the same way - there's variation, but even the variation is within pretty tightly defined bounds. As a result it's easy to generate interesting ideas by moving at right angles. It's easy to make weird things - you just do something that makes people go "Sure, you could do that, but why would you?"</p>


<p>A lot of where I learned a taste for this sort of thing and developed this skill is, I think, in <a href="http://basement.warehouse23.com/">the Warehouse 23 basement</a>. Someone on Twitter described the Warehouse 23 basement as a kind of proto <a href="http://www.scpwiki.com/">SCP</a> and that's not wrong but I think misses something important about it: The things in the Warehouse 23 basement are really quite low effort, and that's part of their virtue. It's seconds or minutes of work, not hours, and so you can iterate on the skill of generating them quite easily.</p>


<p>This sort of idea generation is what Edward de Bono calls "lateral thinking". As with all Edward de Bono books, his book of the same is quite annoying, but it is genuinely useful. I'm particularly a big fan of his suggestion of making lists of a fixed size. Committing to generating, say, 100 ideas, forces you to come up with things that you wouldn't otherwise.</p>


<p>Lateral thinking is foundational to a lot of creative processes, because often the way to come up with a good idea is to generate many bad ones and see what resonates, then improve on some of the best or most interesting parts of it, and practicing the ability to do it in a generalised sense is useful.</p>


<p>Often when I think about developing useful general skills I think in terms of very sensible reasonable exercises that develop the skill. The warehouse 23 basement is a nice reminder that you can also just develop skills by having fun.</p>


<ul>
<li>There is an elevator room. It doesn't contain an elevator, it's just got lots of pictures of interesting elevators. A low voice is playing in the background, telling you endless interesting facts about elevators.</li>
<li>There is a room in which every time you say something a small child's voice plays, asking you "But <em>why</em>?"</li>
<li>There is a room in which anything is possible.</li>
</ul>

<p class="subtitle">What does one do on bad days?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-09</dd>
</dl>


<p>Today is not a particularly good day for me. I guess it would be a stretch to call it a bad day, but I'm tired and out of sorts, struggling to focus as a result, and generally not at my finest. Not particularly depressed or anything, just a bit meh.</p>


<p>I'm writing this piece anyway, because I wanted to write something every day and I think it's good for me to stick to that - both in the sense that I'm able to do it and I committed to doing it, so I should, and also in the sense that I want to do it and I think it's helpful for me to do so.</p>


<p>But at the same time, I have some actually involved writing projects I want to do. I'm still figuring out a (paid) newsletter issue on taste that I have to finish, am planning to write up a lot of my old notebook posts on emotions into a more coherent form, and am still reading "Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life". None of that really appeals today, nor does the slightly more sophisticated notebook post I was going to write instead of this one.</p>


<p>And honestly it's reasonable that they don't appeal today. I could do them if I had to, it's not that I'm literally incapable of them, but possibly I'm impaired enough that I shouldn't: the benefit is reduced from me at my peak performance, and the cost increased. They're things that are definitely worth doing on a good day, but maybe they're not today.</p>


<p>This is something of a recurring pattern for me. I couldn't really tell you how often it happens (I probably should be able to, but I'm not sure what counts as "it". Also I hate data entry. Please don't give me advice on this, I don't want your advice, and I will shout at you in my <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/no-backseating">No Backseating</a> voice), but certainly it's not an unusual occurrence. I'd guess I have a day at least this bad most weeks, sometimes more often than that.</p>


<p>And this often leaves me thinking about the question of what to do with those days.
Or, I guess, more specifically how to avoid losing them to dissociative activities. It's very easy to get to the end of a bad day and go "Wait, what did I <em>do</em> today?" and discover that the answer is that you spent all of it on Twitter, or playing games, or watching youtube videos, or something else of that ilk.
This seems bad.</p>


<p>If I had a real job of course (and sometimes even when I've not had a real job and it was purely self inflicted) what I would do with such days (if they fell on a weekday) is to sacrifice them on the altar of the god of presenteeism. Can't do anything useful today? Tough luck. We'll punish you for taking the day off, but turning up and being miserable and not getting any work done is fine, so...</p>


<p>It's relatively far down on the list of complaints I have about society, but definitely one of the failings is that we treat human beings as more reliable than they are, and then make it their problem when they fail to live up to that impossible ideal.</p>


<p>Setting that aside... In an ideal world, what would we like such days to be like?</p>


<p>I've suggested to coaching clients that it's good to build up a sort of library of things they can do for breaks, or when feeling bad. Going for a walk is one, doing some meditation or lying semisupine another, but these feel more like pause activities than fulfilling. Also I often don't <em>want</em> to do these things.</p>


<p>Maybe I'm just being melodramatic due to my low mood, but it feels like this question is butting up against foundational questions like "What is life for?". Having a day where one is feeling tired and low motivation feels like one is butting up against the "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-zEH8YmiM">We've got both kinds of sources of meaning, production <em>and</em> consumption</a>" that it feels too easy to settle into. You end up stripped of access to meaning, mostly by laying bare how limited your access to it was in the first place, and are forced to ask what's left. It's no wonder it's easy to lose these days in activities that are designed to help you fast forward life.</p>


<p>Reading that paragraph back to myself does rather feel like I was lying when I said I wasn't having a particularly depressed day, doesn't it? Oh well. I'm going to go for a walk and pretend to be thinking deep thoughts while I do.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Heading towards the ouch</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-08</dd>
</dl>


<p>Here's an interesting therapeutic technique that I've synthesized out of various practices.
It's not exactly a <em>safe</em> practice, but I do think it's a useful one.
I deployed a bit of it earlier in a coaching session (after extensive checking in with the client that this was really what they wanted me to do, including asking "This is going to require me to be an asshole to you. Are you sure you want me to do that?"),
but I haven't quite got a handle on how to facilitate it for someone else yet because I don't generally do it for other people.</p>


<p>The technique is as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>Say something that you don't want to say (or possibly think it clearly. Saying it out loud is supposed to work better, but I sometimes find the opposite).</li>
<li>Does it hurt? Good. Identify why it hurts.</li>
<li>Take the part that hurts and say something new based on it. If that hurts more, switch to that as your new starting point. If not, stick with the current one.</li>
<li>Keep doing this until you run out of "improvements" or it gets too much and you need to stop.</li>
<li>Use wherever you've ended up as a prompt for introspection. Explain why it feels so bad, in depth, what you're worried about, evaluate whether the statement is actually true, etc.</li>
</ol>


<p>For example, such a sequence for me might look like:</p>


<ol>
<li>I should get a real job.</li>
<li>I'm just kidding myself about being able to make writing work as a career.</li>
<li>I'm not going to see it through anyway.</li>
<li>I'll just quit as soon as it gets too difficult.</li>
</ol>


<p>I don't think this is necessarily true (I sure hope it's not!), but there's definitely some part of me that believes that,
and I can notice a real physical discomfort increasing as I move down the list. I really don't like the last entry at all.</p>


<p>This is roughly a shadow work / Focusing hybrid. It's designed to help you uncover emotionally painful beliefs that you're trying to ignore.
Generally these sorts of statements don't hurt unless some part of you believes on some level that they are true,
and this process gets you to a point where you have identified a specific acutely painful belief to interrogate (and ideally do something like coherence therapy to to defuse it, if indeed that belief is false. See e.g. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">Emotional reactions as legacy code</a>).</p>


<p>It's also, I think, probably quite a good tool for learning Focusing because of how unsubtle it is. This is not staying with a fuzzy unclear feeling until it makes sense, this is confronting you with exactly what a felt sense dialled up to 11 is like. It's oddly similar to the strategy I outlined in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-06-13:53.html">Start from amazing</a>, in that it dials up the feelings until they can be clearly identified so you know what to look for, rather than leaving you in a fuzzy in between space where you're not sure if anything is going on there or not.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Studying the mundane</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>One of the things that you might notice about the things that I write is that they're often about really mundane topics.</p>


<p>Here are some examples:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/telegraph-your-moves">Telegraph your moves</a> contains a significant discussion of why you should tell people when you're running late.</li>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/you-should-complain-about-it">You should complain about it</a> is about complaining (obviously).</li>
<li><a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-do-everything">How to do everything</a> is almost entirely about this (I do briefly talk about mathematics and writing, but mostly it's not about that) and touches on profound topics such as how to catch a ball, how to clean your bathroom, and how to open a bag of rice.</li>
</ul>


<p>I do not write about mundane topics because they are sources of deep philosophical insight. I write about them because I am actually trying to solve mundane problems. I said in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-03-13:55.html">No shortage of things to write about</a> that "in order to run out of things to write, I'd have to basically have life solved. I'm uh a little ways away from that". This is true. But necessarily a significant number of the problems I have not solved in my life are mundane, because most of life is mundane, and I still think these problems are worth writing about.</p>


<p>This isn't to say that I'm <em>only</em> interested in mundane problems, but mundane problems are important, and often <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/life-complete-problems">life complete</a> in interesting ways, and by their very mundanity will often have high impact. I don't know if my writing has ever made anyone blissfully happy, but I do know multiple people who have improved the way they cleaned their bathroom and had a slightly less annoying rice opening experience as a result, and that too is part of the good life.</p>


<p>A particular reason I study and think about mundane things is that I think that there's often a lot of low hanging fruit available for improving them. People don't spend much time thinking about mundane problems, and even less time on how to communicate improvements in them.</p>


<p>To a large degree this is rational: You essentially improve until what you've got is "good enough" and it's not worth figuring out how to improve further.
Importantly though, the effort that isn't worth it is that of <em>figuring out</em> how to improve further. Often doing better is lower effort than what you're doing now, or very high benefit. Once you know how to do something the better way, it's clearly worth doing it that way (if it weren't, it wouldn't be a better way, it would be a way with a different set of trade offs), but that doesn't mean it's worth inventing that better way.</p>


<p>(It may also still not be worth learning that better way, or you may not want to, and that's fine. I'm both not that great at tying my shoes and know full well I could fix this with a couple of hours spent studying <a href="https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm">Ian Fieggen's Shoe Lace website</a>, but have I done that? I absolutely have not)</p>


<p>I on the other hand am perfectly happy to put in that effort, because I find it interesting, and I have time to spend, and also there's a lot of stuff that other people seem to be "naturally" good at that I've had to figure out the hard way, so once I've invested all that mental infrastructure in learning this stuff I might as well keep going.</p>


<p>And... it turns out it's not that hard. There are some core skills that it's worth developing, but they're generally useful core skills for life, mundane or otherwise. Mostly you just need to learn to break out of habits, spot patterns, and identify where you've taken problems as immutable when they're actually easily fixable things. I'm not claiming this is <em>easy</em>, but it's not rocket surgery or anything, and almost by definition it's a skillset for making most parts of your life better.</p>


<p>It does take time and energy, and I'm aware those are both often in short supply, so I don't expect too many people to do as much thinking about this as I do, but that's fine. I don't mind having a niche, and I expect I'll keep it. After all, literally nobody else is ever going to <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/refusing-to-learn">explain how to keep your flat clean in terms of the work of James C. Scott on the early development of agrarian states</a>.</p>


<p>(Although I could totally see <a href="https://goula.sh/">Meekaale</a> doing this with Hubert Dreyfus and Alasdair MacIntyre instead)</p>

<p class="subtitle">Start from amazing</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-06</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm out of spoons for the piece about taste I was going to be writing today, so I'll finish it off some other day.
Instead, here's a short piece to think about.</p>


<p>You know that thing that happens, where you say you don't like something, and someone tells you that you've probably just never tried a good example of it?</p>


<p>It's annoying, right?</p>


<p>Sometimes it's annoying in that way where someone tells you that you should exercise more, get more daylight, eat your greens. That sort of thing. You know it, and you know it's true, but god it sounds like so much <em>work</em>.</p>


<p>Sometimes it's annoying because you <em>have</em> tried versions that everyone tells you are good, and they still haven't worked for you.
Maybe they were kinda fine, maybe they still had something you didn't like, maybe something else. Either way, you've tried the examples that people have collectively decided are good, and you've concluded the whole thing just isn't to you.</p>


<p>First off, I should say, it's completely OK to not like something. This is allowed. Not everything has to be for you. There's not nearly enough time to like everything, and there's no obligation to like things you don't want to.</p>


<p>But sometimes you find yourself in a position where you <em>want</em> to like something, but the things everyone suggests as good aren't really working for you.</p>


<p>I think this is because the recommendation of trying good things is wrong. Don't try good things, try amazing things. When you're trying to learn to like something, anything short of amazing isn't going to cut it.</p>


<p>Ideally, try things that even people who are no more than passingly into the genre think are amazing, because that the scene thinks is amazing is often a bit esoteric and relies on things that you will not really appreciate until you are more familiar with the genre (in much the same way <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-04-12:52.html">that you won't yet get the jokes</a>).</p>


<p>Really though, the goal here is not to use some external measure of amazingness - that's just a good way to find candidates - but to find things that <em>you</em> think are amazing, that are so good that all of your objections to the genre are blown away and you find yourself faced with the inescapable conclusion that <em>of course</em> you like this, how could you not?</p>


<p>In the long run, not everything you consume will be amazing of course, but finding things that are amazing lets you anchor your sense of what's good about what you are trying to learn to appreciate. The qualities that you experience in the amazing examples are the qualities you are looking for in subtler forms in the good. But it's easier to start with things that blow you away and work backwards from there than it is to spend a lot of time in an ambiguous space going "Am I enjoying this? I don't know? Maybe?" trying to appreciate the finer qualities of something that you are currently experiencing as merely OK.</p>


<p>Starting from the amazing examples is the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html">existence proof</a> that you need. You have demonstrated that you <em>can</em> enjoy the thing, all you need now is to expand outwards Now you just need to work outwards from there using the <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">fully general system</a>.</p>


<p>Part of the context for this is that I have an ongoing sense that I would like to learn to appreciate poetry. Not that I <em>should</em>, but that I would like to. I'll freely admit I haven't tried very hard, but what I have tried hasn't worked very well.</p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LisaIRMcNulty">Lisa</a> recently suggested that maybe I needed to listen to it instead of read it,
because really poetry is always intended to be experienced in spoken form, and suggested I try some of the videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ButtonPoetry">Button Poetry</a>.</p>


<p>I spent a while clicking through some no doubt perfectly good poetry that was doing absolutely nothing for me, and was just about to conclude this as a failed experiment when I happened across the following:</p>


<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFTASR8BMps" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>


<p>The experience of watching this was not unlike accidentally stepping out in front of a truck full of feelings, and left me shaking for about an hour. It may not hit you that way, that's fine. This reaction isn't for you, it's for me.</p>


<p>But this is the level of reaction you should be seeking. Something that takes your previous ambivalence and washes it away it away in a flood, a revelation leaving you with no choice but to say "Oh. I get it now."</p>
