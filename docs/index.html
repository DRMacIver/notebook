<p class="subtitle">How is laughter social?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>

<p>Random book prompt, from page 54 of John Moreall's "Comic Relief":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>First, the natural setting for humor, as for play generally, is a group, not an individual. Kierkegaard asked a friend, "Answer me honestly ... do you really laugh when you are alone?" He concluded that you have to be "a little more than queer" if you do. According to Henri Bergson, "You would hardly appreciate the comic if you felt yourself isolated from others. Laughter appears to stand in need of an echo."</p>
<p>It's hard to get into the play mode by oneself. Often when I expereince events alone, especially those involving setbacks, I don't see the humor in them until I am later describing them to other people. And even if I expereince an event as funny while I'm by myself, it's unlikely that I'll enjoy it <em>as much</em> as when I later share it in conversation.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Perhaps I'm a little more than queer (I'm certainly more than a little queer), but I don't believe this at all. I think laughing on your own is normal and Kierkegaard needed to read funnier books.</p>


<p>In fact I think I am likely to laugh much harder on my own than in company.</p>


<p>For example, the hardest I've laughed recently was at the following image:</p>


<p><img src="/images/piiswhat.png"/></p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/saleemrash1d/status/1451195339084492801">From this tweet</a>.</p>


<p>I don't know why I find this as funny as I do. It's objectively very funny, but also I laughed to the point of struggling to breathe for nearly a minute. I was on my own.</p>


<p>I've similarly been in hysterics reading a Terry Pratchett novel, to a degree that I wouldn't normally in company.</p>


<p>In contrast, watching comedy, or having a funny conversation with a friend or partner, I will laugh regularly, but rarely to that level of intensity.</p>


<p>It does happen. My sister, L, and I have been known to trigger this in each other.</p>


<p>For example, a few years ago, she and I were sitting in the kitchen at my parents' place in the lead up to Christmas, having a long conversation. At some point the conversation was talking about how annoying it was that we'd both inherited the genes from my mother's side of the family that makes it very easy for us to put on weight (my brother is, in comparison to us, very skinny), and that we'd both like to be a bit lighter than we were.</p>


<p>At some point in this conversation, we looked down at our shared task, and our hands that were just absolutely <em>covered</em> in chocolate from the brandy truffles that we were making (My grandmother's recipe. It's like <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-14-11:44.html">processing redcurrants</a> but more delicious) and simultaneously cracked up.</p>


<p>L and I have done this a few times. There was a soup conversation that did it too, but you had to be there for that one to be even slightly funny.</p>


<p>It's fairly rare for me to be able to do this with someone (I think all my examples of this happening are family or romantic partners), and I think the reason is that in order to achieve this you have to have a fairly large degree of comfort and synchronicity with the other person or people, and even with such people it's not the norm unless you're currently <em>very</em> in synch.</p>


<p>What happens instead seems to be that although you don't laugh as hard in company, you laugh more easily.</p>


<p>Social laughter seems to obey a very simple rule which explains both these things: You should be laughing about the same amount as everyone else.</p>


<p>As a result, laughter in a group follows a rise and a fall, where some people "seed" the laughter, and it rises, bringing everyone along with them for a bit, and then as people stop laughing it brings the overall level down and people follow, everyone dynamically adjusting their level of laughter to be not too far from the overall average.</p>


<p>As a result, you tend not to laugh too intensely unless everyone is in synch, because you have to raise your intensity at a rate everyone will follow, but also you tend to laugh more easily because once someone starts laughing probably so does everybody else.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A simple model of depression and "depressive realism"</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-19</dd>
</dl>


<p>I was talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/fvathynevgl/">Vathy</a> about depressive realism,
and when I expressed skepticism about its existence they asked me to say more. I did,
and it seemed an unusual enough perspective that I thought I'd quickly write it up in a blog post.</p>


<p>So here's what I think, roughly. This is a simplified version of what I actually think (because what I actually think is a giant tangle of stuff I haven't fully figured out), and what I actually think is probably no more than roughly right, but I still think this is a good model that is helpful to bear in mind.</p>


<p>Basically it's this: Humans have all sorts of biases in their thinking. No matter what anyone tells you, this isn't bad. Biases are good, as long as you're expecting to make mistakes (and, I hate to break it to you, humans make a lot of mistakes and are going to keep doing that), because <em>not all mistakes are created equal</em>. If you're going to make mistakes, you want to bias in the direction of mistakes that are safe to make.</p>


<p>(See e.g. <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/02/theres-no-single-error-rate/">There's no single error rate</a>).</p>


<p>One of the ways that depression differs from healthy cognition is that it has a much stronger bias in the direction of inaction than healthy cognition does. If you see a problem, you can decide to do something about it or not. A depressed person is much more likely than a non-depressed person to choose inaction,
and as a result is more likely to believe things that justify that inaction (this latter feature isn't specific to depression - a non-depressed person who chooses action is more likely to believe things that justify that action. Motivated reasoning is a whole big thing).</p>


<p>As a result, a depressed person is more likely to get the right answer in situations where the right answer is inaction, and less likely to get the right answer in situations where the right answer is action.</p>


<p>In situations where the right answer is typically inaction (which can happen if you're in a dangerous environment which you have little control over, certainly, and as a matter of numbers this is probably more likely for depressed people) this will tend to mean that depressed people are more likely to be right than people who are neutral or biased towards action, but it's not that the depressed person is more realistic than the non-depressed person, it's that their biases are currently well adapted to their situation, and if the situation changes they would retain those biases and be less well adapted. I'm no more inclined to call this realism than I am to call a stopped clock accurate because it happens to be stopped at the current time.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Learning how to tell a joke</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>From page 10 of Ted Cohen's "Jokes":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Joking is a "two-stage" art, like music and theater. Someone must make up the joke, and someone must tell it, and these two jokers need not be the same. Those good at making up jokes are not the same as those good at telling them. Telling a joke well may require specific abilities, like being able to affect an Irish dialect, or it may require a subtle knack, like a sense of timing.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>He goes on to say that this presentation is particularly important because some jokes don't translate well onto the page, and illustrates this with the following joke that you are legally required to include in all books about philosophy of comedy or they take your license away:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Q: According to Freud, what comes between fear and sex?</p>
<p>A: Fünf.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Cohen is wrong here, this joke translates to the page just fine, because you can just read it out loud.</p>


<p>This routine on the other hand is an example of a joke that <em>actually</em> doesn't translate to the page:</p>


<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XkCBhKs4faI" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>


<p>This both illustrates the strengths and the flaws of the two-stage art concept.</p>


<p>From a writing point of view, the joke isn't very good, right? It's perfectly well written, there's nothing wrong with it, but as written it's not funny, because the humour is entirely in the presentation.
This is why it demonstrates the strength of the two stage model: it's a very good illustration of the verbal skills of humour.</p>


<p>But it also demonstrates that the idea is something of a lie, in that you can't actually separate this into two stages. It's not just that the joke doesn't work written down, it's that there is no joke without the performance of it here.</p>


<p>This is, perhaps, an artefact of the fact that comedy isn't really about telling jokes, it's about performing routines, but I think this distinction doesn't work, and you experience the same problems with hypercontextual jokes that cannot be extracted from their situation.</p>


<p>What instead is going on, I think, is that for any given joke there is a <em>skill of telling that joke</em>, and some jokes you can teach that skill in writing better than others.</p>


<p>Another interesting example of this sort of skill is poetry reading. Some poems work written, but this one I've linked to before in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-06-13:53.html">Start from amazing</a> isn't one of them:</p>


<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tFTASR8BMps" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>


<p>The poem is good, but the presentation of it is <em>very</em> good, and the poem rests on the vocal skill of its delivery.</p>


<p>Back in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-28-04:40.html">You can't write life down</a> I talked about the difficulty in transcribing oral stories, and this feels like another aspect of that. At the time I talked about how taking a Raven story outside of its cultural context would lose essential features of the culture that created it, leaving it in a diminished and abstracted form, but actually I think the problem is deeper than that: You can write down a Raven story, but I'm not sure you can write down how to <em>tell</em> a Raven story.</p>

<p class="subtitle">We must imagine the steelman happy</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-11</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm getting increasingly frustrated with the core of virtue ethics around eudaimonia,
so today I would like to put together a steelmanned version of something that is <em>almost</em> what they are saying and I think is actually true.</p>


<p>It's entirely possible that what I am doing is recreating something they actually are saying,
and that I disagree with them less than I think I do, but if so they have very much failed to communicate this to me.</p>


<h3>Do people pursue happiness?</h3>


<p>So here is, in summary, what I think virtue ethicists are claiming:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>People (unconsciously or consciously) organise their lives around a single goal, and that goal is happiness (or eudaimonia, but as far as I can tell eudaimonia just means "happiness but we don't like the connotations of that word").</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It is possible that this is a strawman and if so I would appreciate correction. </p>


<p>I think this is wrong, and the true version of it is a composite of three things that almost but not quite add up to this.</p>


<ol>
<li>People wish to be happy to a degree they endorse as appropriate for their situation.</li>
<li>They wish their situations to be ones that would make them happy under this endorsed happiness.</li>
<li>They take on ends that they believe will help them achieve this wish.</li>
</ol>


<p>Adding this up together you could summarise this as "People seek their happiness as an end", but I think that summary would be wrong in a way that the tripartite version is not.</p>


<p>(I don't think this tripartite version is <em>perfectly</em> right either - I'll point out some problems in a bit).</p>


<p>Let's consider the following test case: Someone you love has just died. You are, understandably, quite unhappy about this. Someone offers you a pill that will erase all the grief and will cause you to feel euphoric. Do you take it?</p>


<p>Some people will say yes to this of course. Even more people would (and do) say yes to something that merely blunts the grief. I think, particularly near to the event, many people would say no. Certainly I would.</p>


<p>My point with this thought experiment is not that there is a correct answer. My point is that the correct answer is not <em>obviously</em> that yes you should take the pill, and I don't think most people would consider it strange that it's not.</p>


<p>Further, this idea of appropriate happiness seems in general true. For example, I think most people who are not particularly sadistic would not want to be sadistic, even if it might strictly increase their happiness, because sadism does not seem like the sort of thing you should be happy about.</p>


<p>I don't think this is a controversial perspective in virtue ethics, but I think by binding together the ideas of "appropriately happy" and "happy" they have committed themselves to some weird takes where they have to say "Ah, but that's not <em>really</em> happiness".</p>


<p>Take <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-10-09-20:42.html">The problem of Susan</a> from the other day.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Susan thinks of her life as a happy one; she is married with children, and all is well except that her husband is frequently away on business. She discovers that in fact these absences were spent with a second family, and that he has divided his time between the two families for some years. Uncontroversially, Susan evaluated her life positively before the discovery, and no longer did so after the discovery. The question is: before the discovery, was her life happy or not?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This example is not remotely problematic under this separation: Susan was happy, but a version of Susan in posession of all the facts would not endorse that happiness as appropriate (even though Susan at the time might have).</p>


<p>I think one of the reasons virtue ethicists ignore this split is to some degree it goes away for virtuous agents, because one of the key features of the way virtue ethics treats virtue is that through the development of phronesis and the cultivation of the virtues one pursues (1) automatically: A perfectly virtuous agent feels happy precisely to the degree they would endorse as appropriate.</p>


<p>But note that the problem of Susan doesn't go away even if Susan is perfectly virtuous: The problem is not that prior to the revelation Susan was living unvirtuously, it's that she was deceived. A sufficiently intelligent adversary (e.g. a Cartesian demon) can deceive even a perfectly virtuous agent, and besides which a perfectly virtuous agent can simply be wrong by virtue of not being omniscient. I can be happy about the prospect of things that I expect to happen over the coming years, not knowing that actually the world is going to be destroyed by an unknown asteroid next year, and this is not a failure of appropriateness I just don't know everything.</p>


<h3>Do you even want to be happy?</h3>


<p>Another important way this split comes up is in therapy. People are unhappy, so they go to therapy to try to figure out how to be happy. And sometimes it's genuinely "just" an emotional issue, but more often than not it's actually perfectly reasonable for them to be unhappy and if they're really lucky they won't get a therapist who teaches them how to gaslight themselves into thinking otherwise.</p>


<p>I'm a fan of this piece in good housekeeping: <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/a45386/gratitude-lists-dont-work/">Gratitude lists are BS</a>.</p>


<p>First she describes her attempts to be happier:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>After about 100 days of making gratitude lists, tens of thousands of dollars of psychotherapy, five different antidepressants, four months in an outpatient psychiatric hospital (where they strongly recommended we make gratitude lists) and myriad of high-priced alternative treatments, I had pretty much given up all hope of ever feeling better. Then my psychiatrist suggested I speak with a therapist in his office who worked with people with a history of trauma. Great, I thought, another opportunity to shell out more money to someone who can't help me. I shushed myself, told myself to be grateful for his offer — and to add it tomorrow's gratitude list.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This didn't work for her, because...</p>


<blockquote>
<p>My new therapist told me to write down everything I did and thought and said to myself throughout the day and send him the record each night so he could try to get some insight into what was really going on. I did, being sure to highlight the positives in my day to show him that I did recognize that there were some good things in my life. When I got to my next session, he told me the words I'd been so desperately longing to hear for years:</p>
<p>"Man, your life just SUCKS right now."</p>
<p>"It's not that bad," I said nervously, assuming he was either grossly incompetent or trying to trick me. "I have a lot to be grateful for."</p>
<p>"Really?" he replied, then proceeded to list off what he'd observed in my daily records: that I'd worked the overnight shift at jobs for years, which meant I barely slept; that the apartment I lived in was only so cheap because it was dark, cramped, ant-infested and falling apart; that my husband and I were raising a baby in one of the most expensive cities in the country, where decaying two-bedroom bungalows with no yards or parking spaces started at $800,000; that I had no family support system, since my closest relative lived 3,000 miles away; that years of working from home left me completely isolated with very few friends; that I was under extreme financial stress due to massive student loan debt; that I was a writer who had no time or energy to write because I was so busy trying to put out the fires in the rest of my life; that the few things I did have time to write got rejected over and over again; that I'd auditioned for over 150 commercials and had never booked one; that I'd blown my meager life savings on years of out-of-network psychotherapy treatment that hadn't worked; that I woke up in excruciating back pain every day; that I'd grown up in an emotionally abusive household where my mother encouraged me to watch "Pollyanna" on a regular basis while my father, who had combat PTSD and a traumatic brain injury, exploded in rages without warning; that I had to literally carry my baby over the passed out bodies of the homeless drug addicts who slept in front of our house; that my transmission had gone up in smoke four months after I'd paid my car; that all three of my cats had died over the past three years, and that my dog now had cancer — the most severe and fast moving case my vet said she'd seen in her 20 years of practice.</p>
<p>It all kind of sucked pretty effing hard, my new therapist said.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think it is reasonable to say that the problem here is not that she's unhappy, but that she is unhappy because of all of the problems, and that the natural and reasonable way to "pursue happiness" here is not to try to become happier but to try to solve the problems that are making her unhappy.</p>


<p>There is an argument to be made for acceptance, and I think there is a <em>strong</em> argument to make that one should ideally be able to cope with those problems without becoming overwhelmingly depressed, but I think either approach starts with acknowledging that yeah actually these things suck, and you cannot "pursue happiness" as a goal independently from how you navigate the practical things that are impacting your happiness.</p>


<p>I suggest that the very idea that people want to be happy is a confusion of how situations like this work, and it's a harmful one. People don't want to be happy, happiness is the feeling of things going as you want.</p>


<h3>Acting while depressed</h3>


<p>Another way the notion of "endorsed happiness" is useful is that one can treat it as action guiding even while not currently feeling particularly equipped to feel happy. i.e. depressed.</p>


<p>Often when I'm depressed I do things not because I feel any emotional motivation to do them, but because I know that a less depressed version of me would. There is a sort of wanting to achieve things that is possible somewhat independently of the emotional motivation for it.</p>


<p>This tends to be hard during long depressive periods, or without much extrinsic motivation to do things, but I do find that it's possible to just weather through a short depressive period because you intellectually still know what you want even if you don't feel happy about getting it, and can just act on that. It's harder to give it your all, and you generally feel tired and low energy, but it's not like the conceptual understanding of what you want to achieve is inaccessible, it "just" doesn't <em>feel</em> rewarding when you do those things.</p>


<p>This certainly isn't all that depression is, but I do think one of the key features of depression is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html">a restriction on emotional range</a>, and a key part of that is that you can often still fully understand and act on your motivational structure without feeling it.</p>


<h3>Speaking of...</h3>


<p>Speaking of the emotional difficulties and motivational structure, writer's block just kicked in. Apparently I'm still struggling with writing complete essays even when it's on the notebook blog, so I'm going to finish here and maybe continue another day.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The problem of Susan</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-10-09</dd>
</dl>


<p>Up front warning: I increasingly hate Julia Annas's account of happiness and every post that is about this subject will likely be very cranky. This is one such post.</p>


<p>From Intelligent Virtue, Page 141, we have the following example:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Susan thinks of her life as a happy one; she is married with children, and all is well except that her husband is frequently away on business. She discovers that in fact these absences were spent with a second family, and that he has divided his time between the two families for some years. Uncontroversially, Susan evaluated her life positively before the discovery, and no longer did so after the discovery. The question is: before the discovery, was her life happy or not?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1447177704760037376">asked about this on Twitter</a>. At present most people say yes, a couple of people make the subjective/objective happiness distinction that Annas is talking about in context.</p>


<p>A couple of people point out that it's likely that she <em>wasn't</em> happy, because probably someone living a life like that is not actually experiencing a very good life, and many low grade unhappinesses will probably be clarified and recontextualised in the light of the revelation. It's also possible she was engaged in self-deception to maintain a belief that she was happy. "Sure, there are a few problems, but can't complain you know?".</p>


<p>I think this is all true, but I'm happy to postulate that Susan could in principle have been genuinely happy with her life, even if it doesn't seem very likely. Likely that happiness came from other sources than her husband, but that's fine.</p>


<p>None of this touches on my actual complaint with this example, which a few other people also shared, which is that it's obviously a category error, the question doesn't actually make sense.</p>


<p>Moreover, it's clearly a <em>motivated</em> category error, one that only makes sense through conflating two distinct things that the author is committed to conflating in order to support her broader thesis.</p>


<p>Was Susan's life happy or not? No, it's a life. Happy is not a things life can be, any more than physics can be happy. "Happy" is an emotional evaluation, and lives are not things with emotions. I understand that when people say "Did they have a happy life?" that is normal colloquial English that means something more like "Were they happy with their life?" but when you are trying to make a precise statement on the nature of happiness there is absolutely no excuse for this sort of ambiguity which blurs precisely the distinction you are trying to make.</p>


<p>It's possible that I'm incorrectly translating the intent of this, but if so I think that makes it worse rather than better, because up to this point we have been talking about people seeking their own happiness, and if we mean something different from their own happiness by "having a happy life", why is this the question we're asking?</p>


<p>The questions I believe should be and are not being asked here are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Was Susan happy with her life?</li>
<li>Did Susan have a good life?</li>
</ul>


<p>And the only reason to blur the boundary between these very different questions is if you are committed to an unsupportable notion that happiness is the sole end of life, and to conflating the notion of "happy life" with "good life", in order to make them look like the same question.</p>


<p>The following further unasked questions are also particularly loud:</p>


<ul>
<li>Would Susan have chosen this life?</li>
<li>Before knowing the truth, would Susan have chosen to learn it if she knew the consequences?</li>
<li>Once Susan knows the truth, would she choose to go back if she could?</li>
</ul>


<p>Asking these questions probably results in a fairly consistent clustering around "Susan was happy", "Susan would have chosen to know" (certainly this is my answer), which is a problem if you are committed to the position that people's driving goal is happiness</p>


<blockquote>
<p>If positive evaluation of your life is what happiness is, then Susan had a happy life until the discovery. But this runs into the problem that we are also inclined to say that after the discovery Susan discovered that her life never was a happy one; she was deceived into thinking that it was.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Another presumptious we. I do not think it makes sense to say that she was deceived into believing her life was a happy one. She was deceived as to the nature of her life, and also she was happy.</p>
