<p class="subtitle">Does a fish have a face?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-21</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm trying a new thing today, which is to integrate my daily notebook practice, my daily rereading practice, and a bit of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">randomization of decision making</a>. I don't plan to do this every day, but I may do it more often.</p>


<p>The basic mechanism:</p>


<ol>
<li>I pick a book of my choosing.</li>
<li>I generate a page number uniformly at random from the main book contents.</li>
<li>I pick an interesting passage and copy it out here.</li>
<li>I then write something inspired by it.</li>
</ol>


<p>If this takes off I'll probably build some tooling into the notebook for getting me to do this properly but for now I'm mostly hand cranking it.</p>


<p>This is partly inspired by having recently-ish been listening to <a href="https://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/">Harry Potter and the Sacred Text</a>. I'm deeply indifferent to Harry Potter but have been enjoying their sacred text reading techniques. This process in particular is very loosely inspired by their (in turn somewhat loosely interpreted) practice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lectio_Divina">Lectio Divina</a></p>


<p>Today's reading comes from <a href="https://amzn.to/3exHrih">Finding Our Sea Legs</a>, page 126:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>While he hedges his bets when it comes to dogs, it is hard to imagine Levinas having much time for the idea that a fish might have a face, or the idea that I could be infinitely responsible for a fish. Fish, as far as we human beings are concerned, are more alien to us than the stranger who knocks on our door, or the dog who wags his tail in greeting. They move in a different element, they have no lungs, their blood is cold, not warm, they do not sleep. And yet, while they may not have faces in the sense that Levinas means, they still hav efaces, in the ordinary everyday sense: We can look them in the eye, and these denizens of another world can look back.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This might seem like a strange passage (of course fish have faces) but the idea of a "face" in this context is more about our experience of the other as a person. Backtracking to earlier in the book (pages 52-53) we have the following passage:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This curious and seemingly paradoxical idea of the 'face' is that the heart of Levinas's phenomenology of ethics. When we encounter the face of another [our relationship] is 'straightaway ethical.' When I encounter another person, I find myself responsible for them - I find myself unable to do anything other than to respond to them <em>as</em> another person - whether I like it or not.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So the question of whether a fish "has a face" is about whether our interactions with a fish have this phenomenological character: Do we treat a fish as a subject of ethical experience?</p>


<p>Experiences on this tend to differ, both by person and by context. Many people are vegetarian precisely because they experience animals as ethically relevant, and I know one person who as a child became vegetarian in a way that they literally framed as not wanting to eat anything with a face, a category in which they included fish.</p>


<p>Personally, I don't consider fish to be all that ethically relevant (oddly, I consider animals more ethically relevant than fish and yet I eat animals and mostly don't eat fish. This is primarily for environmental reasons though). I will not mourn the death of a fish. And yet, encountering a fish out of water, gasping on dry land, it is hard not to feel sorry for it.
In the abstract, I don't care about the fish, but confronted with the actual reality of the fish and its suffering, it is hard not to experience it as ethically relevant, as having a face.</p>


<p>Almost (I may have been subconsciously inspired in my choice of book) entirely coincidentally, yesterday I was listening to <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/02/18/episode-34-paul-bloom-on-empathy-rationality-morality-and-cruelty/">the Mindscape podcast episode with Paul Bloom</a>, the author of <a href="https://amzn.to/2xCBEYd">Against Empathy</a> (which I haven't read).
His essential argument is that this empathic experience leads us astray from good ethical behaviour. It causes us to overfocus on the individual in front of us - this empathy is what causes us to treat the fish as ethically relevant even if we don't "rationally" believe it to be. It's what causes us to be kind to our neighbour but ignore millions of people living in poverty.</p>


<p>It's also what causes us to overvalue people like us and undervalue people different to us - it's much easier to be empathic to someone whose lived experience we can easily understand, and if we tie our ethics to our empathy then we will tend to prioritise those like us and neglect the Other.</p>


<p>Of course, one can bite this philosophical bullet and say that yes we should be rational in our ethics but also we should consider fish as ethically relevant. This is how you end up with things like <a href="https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/wild-animal-suffering/">Effective Altruists who are very concerned about wild animal suffering</a>. It's possibly they're right - I don't agree with their concerns, but I don't think they're in principle invalid.</p>


<p>I do think he has a point, and that a certain amount of rationality and deliberation in ethics is important, but I think too much of that will drive us towards utilitarianism, which is more like <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-18-11:10.html">policy</a> than the sort of living ethics that I think improves our behaviour in day to day life.</p>


<p>It's worth using rationality as a tool to improve our ethical behaviour, but <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html">emotion is key to effective rationality</a>, and empathy and the experience of the other is a crucial tool in navigating any sort of rational ethics.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Accelerator/Brake Model</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-20</dd>
</dl>


<p>I recently read <a href="https://amzn.to/2VOS9IK">Come As You Are</a>, a book about sexuality (primarily women's sexuality, but it mostly works for everyone).</p>


<p>It is by far the most <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html">annoying</a> book that I will nevertheless recommend. It was about 50% stuff I already knew (which I only skimmed but seemed pretty good), but the other 50% contained a lot of useful ideas that helped make sense of some things I only partially knew. It was also 100% annoying and I hated the author's writing style. I will grant I am not in the target audience for it (it is primarily written for women), but the friend who recommended it was a woman and she also hates the writing style so I don't think that's why, I just think it's objectively very annoying (especially if you're not from the USA).
Nevertheless, it was on balance very worth reading.</p>


<p>One thing that was particularly helpful was the brake/accelerator model for sexual arousal. </p>


<p>The model is very simple: There are two systems, the Sexual Excitation System (SES), the accelerator, and the Sexual Inhibition System (SIS), the brake.
The SES is what turns you on, the SIS is what turns you off.</p>


<p>If you're currently not interested in sex and you'd like to be, you need to understand which of these is at play:
It might be that your accelerator isn't being pushed by the current sexual context, or it might be that something is pressing hard on your brake.</p>


<p>Different people have different levels of sensitivity on each of the brake and accelerator. On average women have much more sensitive brakes (i.e. are much easier to turn off) and men have much more sensitive accelerators (i.e. are much more easy to turn on), but there's a lot of individual variation.</p>


<p>One of the least helpful things you can do is make a mistake about which system is in play. It doesn't help to try to turn someone on if their foot is slammed hard on the brake, and it doesn't help to try to make someone comfortable and at ease if they're already fine and the problem is just that the context isn't at all arousing.</p>


<p>The former is particularly bad, because pressure is one of the things most likely to activate someone's brakes, because it creates negative emotional association with the whole experience. It's also particularly common, because people (especially people who have relatively insensitive brakes, like most guys) often don't realise that the brake is a potential problem at all.</p>


<p>Since reading about the brake/accelerator model I've been seeing it everywhere. I think a lot of motivation is like this, where there are things that we really want to do (the accelerator is on hard) but also procrastinate hard because there's a huge ugh field around the thing and we find it massively hard (so are the brakes) and we just end up with the gearbox in our head grinding.
In the same way as with sex, trying to want to do the thing even more isn't going to help, and treating it as an issue of motivation will just cause one to build up even more guilt and shame around the subject, making it even more aversive.</p>


<p>This likely also ties in to the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a> model of growth, where desire acts as the accelerator and a lack of safety acts as the brake (and indeed a lack of safety is often a major brake activator in a sexual context).
Given <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-19-10:52.html">the context</a> in which I've been thinking about a lot of the personal growth work, it's probably not entirely a coincidence that these track.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on becoming a cis man</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-19</dd>
</dl>


<p>Please note: I ask for clemency and/or good faith reading of this post. This is stuff that is difficult to talk about without stepping on someone's toes.</p>


<p>Required prior reading:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1251790486341390338">Lexie's thread about why cis people should be allowed to think about gender too</a> (to be possibly replaced with a link to a blog post later if they write one)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/the-inner-sense-of-gender/">The Inner Sense of Gender</a> (this was in fact written based on a conversation with Lexie)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/06/on-not-quite-fitting/">On Not Quite Fitting</a></li>
</ul>


<p>In particular this tweet from Lexie's thread is relevant:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>And I have cis friends who have done introspection of their gender, and are now more sure that they’re cis – but talking about it gets shouted down as “you’re trans but you haven’t realised yet”.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I'm one of those cis friends, and I thought it might be useful to talk about this process given that it's not one that gets talked about much.</p>


<p>First off, some politics: My basic stance on transition is that if you want to do it, go for it, you're entitled to. There may be some sort of intrinsic transness vs cisness, I don't know, but I don't think it matters for the purposes of who gets to count as eligible to transition. Bodily autonomy is important, gender is a thing that it is good for people to experiment with if they want to, and people should be trusted to make their own decisions in this space.</p>


<p><em>In particular</em> while I would never suggest this about anyone in particular (and indeed don't have anyone in particular I even suspect of this) I'm morally certain that there are people out there who are at about the same point on the cis/trans spectrum as I am and have decided to transition. That's cool by me. It would both be inappropriate of me to police that, and also I wouldn't want to police that. It's just a thing that they're entitled to do.</p>


<p>I personally decided that transition wasn't the most useful route for me to go down and took an alternative path, but there's no reason other people should make the same decisions as me even presented with broadly the same experience of gender as I have.</p>


<p>Another political-ish note: I'm going to be disagreeing with some things some trans people say in this post. This can be dicey, but I feel reasonably confident in doing so because what I'm going to be disagreeing with his how they interpret <em>my</em> lived experience, not how they interpret theirs. Also, almost all of these are things that I've also talked extensively with other trans people about and largely agreed with them on - there's no broad consensus that I'm disagreeing with, we're just all figuring this out together.</p>


<p>Anyway, on to the main point of this post...</p>


<p>When I wrote "the inner sense of gender" I described myself as "almost certain that I am cis". This fluctuated a bit (both up and down) in the interim, and various people predicted that I would in the end decide I was trans, but I have largely largely settled on certainty that I am cis, at least to the degree that I think the question still makes sense.</p>


<p>One of the reasons I'm not sure it makes sense is that I'm increasingly unconvinced that gender is really a thing.
Many things are <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/09/gendering/">gendered</a>, and that the orientation of gendering is kinda defined by the statistical differences between some sort of "archetypal cis" men and women, but that doesn't neatly fall into saying that there is any one thing that we might call gender. Gender isn't a linear progression from man to woman, it's more like a big ball of biopsychosocial... stuff. This is a lot of why my politics of transition are basically "bodily autonomy, end of story" (the other part is that gatekeeping is not a thing that has historically covered itself in glory in this space).</p>


<p>But, to be concrete: My pronouns will remain he/him, I'm unlikely to engage in any major gender defiance regarding my aesthetic, and it's basically certain that I will never attempt any sort of medical transition (I'll confess to a certain amount of curiosity about the effects of hormones, but it really is just curiosity). To a very large degree I will continue to play the social role of man, and I will become increasingly comfortable with that (and also comfortable with ditching the bits of masculinity that I think are bullshit).</p>


<p>I still think if we had magic Culture level body changing tech I would experiment with other gender presentations, and I still think there's a decent chance that I might end up choosing a feminine or androgynous presentation as my default given that option, but I'd also like to be able to fly and the level of emotional significance these two facts hold is broadly equivalent.</p>


<p>What's changed?</p>


<p>Well, Lexie has been writing about <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2020/04/adventures-in-embodiment/">embodiment</a> recently. I've been part of some of the conversations that prompted that, and have been working on it myself too. I've, sadly, not achieved the same level of euphoria, but I don't think this is a gender thing I just think euphoria is hard emotion for me to access (I'm working on it). I've specifically been working on it in the context of Focusing and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">my work on feelings</a>, which has been extraordinarily helpful. I've also been working on it in the context of Alexander Technique and some of what I've been learning from that in the context of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html">letting my body drive</a> (one of the minor personal annoyances of the pandemic is that it's interrupted my study of this).</p>


<p>One side effect of this is that it has resulted in a great deal more comfort in my body, and reduced my dissociation from it. A lot of things that previously looked kinda like gender dysphoria turned out to be fantasies of "If only my body were completely different I'd be able to connect to it", but it turns out to be perfectly possible for me to connect to my body as it is, and to enjoy my experience of it, it's just quite hard work to acquire the skillset. well maybe it would be easier (certainly it's a common reaction to going on estrogen, but I suspect that some of that is genuinely just that estrogen makes it easier to connect to your embodied emotional state).</p>


<p>This also ties in to a lot of trauma. A thing that I saw on Twitter the other day (I don't want to refind the tweet because it's a general theme and I don't want to pick on her in particular) was a trans woman saying that one of the reasons why she knew she was trans was that "cis men don't typically experience their masculinity as traumatic" and... I'm sorry to report that this is not true. I'm not going to say that we experience exactly the same sort of traumas from it as trans women do (I'd be very surprised if we do, but I'd also be very surprised if there weren't some large overlap). Some of this is that <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">norm acquisition in general is traumatic</a>, some of that is that many of our norms around masculinity are really quite bad.
Going through masculinity training just <em>is</em> traumatic. I expect the same is true for going through femininity training, though the traumas are different.</p>


<p>Some of my specific traumas around this are that many masculine norms are very violent, both literally and figuratively, and are quite damaging to be coerced into. Current western masculine norms are also very homophobic. This is both a problem if you're not actually straight (which I'm not), and if you just happen to have some more feminine traits (I perform masculinity reasonably well in some ways and quite badly in others - for example I'm much more into talking about feelings than I think even the average woman, let alone the average man).</p>


<p>In general, gender non-comformance is punished (both by people of the same gender and the opposite), and almost nobody is perfectly gender conformant, so most people will have gender related traumas. Unpacking some of mine was essential for acquiring a healthier relationship with masculinity (and part of that healthier relationship is boundaries! I'm now much happier saying "No, fuck off, that's a stupid way to be a man. Shan't." to the worse bits).</p>


<p>The final aspect for me has been sex. I've been having a lot of it over the last year or two, and it's been very helpful. I don't plan to go into details here, but I'll note a couple significant features.</p>


<p>First off, lets talk about autogynephilia. I basically agree with Scott Alexander on this: <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/02/10/autogenderphilia-is-common-and-not-especially-related-to-transgender/">Autogenderphilia is common and not especially related to transgender</a>. I've had more than a few fantasies about myself as a woman. I've had more than a few fantasies about myself as a man. I am reasonably gender flexible in fantasy. It's fun and I don't intend to stop. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">Gender is sexy</a> and fantasies are supposed to be sexy.</p>


<p>If you don't realise that this is a thing, it can be very confusing, and the way that literally everybody talks about it (from "autogynephilia isn't real" to "autogynephilia is the main reason people are trans". Both seem to be obviously false) is extraordinarily unhelpful for making sense of a perfectly healthy and common experience.
People do a lot of things in fantasies that they don't especially want to do in real life, and turning this into a whole big thing is a great way to confuse people.</p>


<p>Secondly, a lot of gender related traumas are connected to sex. I don't want to go into details here, but they definitely were for me (it's less dramatic than you might be imagining from that). There is a lot of shame connected up with masculinity and desire, and acquiring a whole bunch of emotions skills while also having a whole bunch of sex was a great way to expose, confront, and defuse those.</p>


<p>Thirdly, for me at least having a penis is fairly central to my experience of masculinity (I'm aware that this is complex for many trans people, so treat this as a personal claim, but I expect it's a personal claim a lot of cis men would make), so uh getting comfortable with using it was a pretty good way of getting comfortable with masculinity.</p>


<p>Finally, sex ties in a lot to embodiment. In many ways the key to good sex is to embody well during it, so sex works very well for providing the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a> for growth in this space (of course, finding people you feel <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safe</a> with is equally important here).</p>


<p>None of this has added up to me suddenly being completely clear or comfortable with my own gender or body, but I'm vastly more so than I've historically been, and I've acquired the skill set and the understanding that allows me to continually improve on that over time.</p>


<p>So, at this point, I am reasonably comfortable in saying that yes I've thought about my gender a lot and I have concluded that I am a cis man, and that I am confident that the more work I do in this space the more thoroughly I will come to understand and embody that.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Dust Motes and Electric Plugs</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>

</dl>


<p>In the last post I talked about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html">incommensurability</a>,
how in general you can't compare things and say that one is better than another.</p>


<p>This is absolutely true, but the reason (that context matters) is important: Without context, you can't say one thing is better than another. With context, you're probably going to have to choose. That choice doesn't have to be stable, it <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">doesn't even have to be deterministic</a>, but you're still going to have to choose, because not choosing is often the same as choosing by default to go with the status quo.
That may be fine sometimes, but often the status quo isn't so great.</p>


<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem">Trolley Problem</a> is very annoying, but one of the reasons it is very annoying is that it deliberately strips the decision making of context.
Implicit in the trolley problem is that you <em>can't ask questions</em>. Variations are tried to tease out your moral intuition (the fat man version, the surgeon version, etc), but within the frame of a particular trolley problem you are not allowed to defer your decision making to context.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, in trolley-like situations you are going to have to choose. You have access to the context, so you don't have to choose contextless, but you do have to choose.</p>


<p><a href="https://robots.law.miami.edu/2019/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/MoralMachineMonster.pdf">Why the moral machine is a monster</a> is a paper I really like which talks about the application of the trolley problem to self-driving cars and why you shouldn't: Software isn't ethics, it's policy, and if you consider the behaviour of self-driving cars having implemented a version of the trolley problem, you need to consider not just the effect of individual ethical choices, but also the way people shape their behaviour knowing that cars implement those choices.</p>


<p>In general this is what policy is: Decisions that are made in the absence of a specific context, to be implemented in specific cases using context only to the degree that it is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html">legible</a> to the policy makers.</p>


<p>The <a href="https://how.complexsystems.fail/">safety in complex systems literature</a> is a good source of evidence around how people behave in the presence of policy: Which is that they often violate it. Some of this is <a href="https://danluu.com/wat/">normalization of deviance</a>, and some of this is because policy can never be sufficiently powerful and flexible to adapt to local context.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, sometimes you have to set policy.</p>


<p>This is particularly true with coordination problems. When it comes to walking you can rely on <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">people deciding which side of the path to walk on</a> but with cars you actually want to set some policy as to which side of the road to drive on.</p>


<p>This is a harmless example because it doesn't actually matter which side you pick, but there are other less harmless ones where you're forced to make hard trade offs.</p>


<p>There are plenty of less harmless ones.</p>


<p>Another annoying thought experiment is <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3wYTFWY3LKQCnAptN/torture-vs-dust-specks">torture vs dust specks</a>, which asks whether it is better to torture someone horribly for 50 years or to give each of an inconceivably large (more than the number of atoms in the universe by some inconceviably large number of orders of magnitude) a speck of dust in their eye. Yudkowsky thinks the answer is obvious, and so do I: The answer is that the question is bad, and he should feel bad for posing it.</p>


<p>That being said, I reluctantly agree with what I presume is his position, that the torture is probably the preferable option, and we can see this with a (somewhat) less ridiculous variant: Would you rather one random person on earth have their eye painfully removed, or every single person on earth have a slightly annoying dust speck in their eye?</p>


<p>(Note: This is a question of <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/08/28/contra-askell-on-moral-offsets/">axiology</a>, not of ethics. I'm, for the moment, not asking you to choose policy or make a decision, I'm just asking which of these situations are better).</p>


<p>I think the answer is obvious: Removing a random eye is better.</p>


<p>Why?</p>


<p>There are currently about 7.5 billion people on the earth. Suppose each of those people had to choose between touching their eye to remove a minor inconvenience, and having a one in 7.5 billion chance of losing that eye.
Would they take it?</p>


<p>Of course they would. People touch their eyes <em>all the time</em>. COVID-19 is teaching us just how often we do it. This has potentially bad consequences, such as disease transmission, and eyes can definitely get infected to the point of losing them as a result of being touched. It's not very likely, but it doesn't have to be very likely for this to matter, all we have to argue is that people shouldn't credibly believe that there's a less than one in 7.5 billion chance of something at least as bad as losing an eye to happen as a result, and I think the reality is that the answer is that there's a significantly greater than one in 7.5 billion chance.</p>


<p>What does this have to do with policy?</p>


<p>Well, consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets">electrical plug design</a>. A friend of a friend once pointed out that there's an interesting trade off implicitly being made in the design of the UK sockets. UK sockets are among the safest in the world from the point of view of preventing electrocution - it's really very hard to electrocute yourself on a UK socket (though a sufficiently dedicated small child with exactly the right mix of ingenuity and stupidity can do it, as I learned the hard way). On the other hand, a UK plug can lie on its back in a way that makes it essentially a caltrop, and some people will step on that and hurt their foot (possibly falling over and injuring themselves badly! This too is a fatality risk, especially for older people).
So, here we are presented with a policy trade off between injured feet and electrocutions. You can't play a "Would you rather?" with these exactly, but people confronted with policy do absolutely have to trade these two off against each other. You can potentially improve both, but it will likely come at the cost of something else - possibly time and money as you roll out a new standard.</p>


<p>Another example of this is speed limits. Why is the speed limit not 20mph everywhere in a city? Why are cars allowed in cities at all? Either of banning cars or reducing the speed limit to 20mph everywhere would have a significant impact on mortality rate, but it would also be incredibly inconvenient for a lot of people, so currently policy is prioritising a large amount of inconvenience against a certain amount of death.</p>


<p>We're also seeing this in COVID-19 planning. Closing schools is an example where policy has chosen a truly vast amount of inconvenience against a relatively small amount of death (possibly partly because the error bars on "relatively small" are really quite large). I'm not saying if I think they're right or wrong to do so (this isn't a thing it's <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-09-11:13.html">useful for me to have an opinion on</a>), but I sure am glad I don't have to make the choice.</p>


<p>A long time ago, <a href="https://mindsarentmagic.org/">Paul Crowley</a> convinced me that the optimal decision for this is always going to take the form of a linear trade off between these. Say, we might choose that 1000 inconvenienced parents is worth 1 death. The argument only works if the set of available policies is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_set">convex</a> but it usually is. I don't think we'll necessarily be able to make good choices about those trade off parameters, andindeed think usually trying to make good choices is probably impossibly hard work, but it's probably often worth thinking about lower and upper bounds, especially ones that are revealed by your preferences in other ways.</p>


<p>For example there are, say, about 3 million cars in London (it's a bit lower than in terms of ownership but people also drive in. This isn't a precise measure). There are also about 100 road fatalities per year in London. So at the bare minimum we've decided that moderately inconveniencing 3 million people for 4 days is worse than a single death. It's not obvious that COVID-19 policy is consistent with that trade off, but equally there are arguments that it shouldn't be (policy during a crisis needn't reflect policy outside that crisis).</p>


<p>I am not a utilitarian. I think it's a bad ethical framework, and people shouldn't use it for individual ethical decisions, but I am increasingly coming around to the view point that it might be a good ethical framework for designing policy. You need to be careful about this, because <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/11/shaping-the-world/">trying to impose simple rules on complex systems often destroys them</a>, but if you're going to set policy this is probably the sort of thinking that you need to engage in.</p>


<p>One of the difficulties with this is that it implies that our individual ethical decision making process should be <em>very</em> different from those of people setting policy. The result will often be that they do things we regard as outrageous like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_life">attaching monetary value to a human life</a>, which they need to do in order to make policy like this.</p>


<p>This seems bad, but I increasingly feel that it seems bad for the same reason that national debt looks horribly fiscally irresponsible if you look at it like individual debt: We're trying to analogise between two things that are actually much more different than they look at first glance.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Ubiquitous Incommensurability</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-17</dd>
</dl>


<p>We were talking in <a href="https://discord.gg/jm97tDN">bookchat</a> about favourite books the other day, and how difficult some people find the problem of listing, say, your top ten favourite books.</p>


<p>I claim the reason that this question is hard is that it's actually impossible, and not in a good way, because even within a category such as books, many things are incommensurable - it doesn't really make sense to compare them in such a way as to say that one is definitively better than another.</p>


<p>In order to illustrate this, let me tell you about two of my favourite books. <a href="https://amzn.to/2VdFtMd">Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2yiOQBs">A Civil Campaign</a>.</p>


<p>Sorting Things Out is a nonfiction book about the way classification systems are developed and how this affects the people interacting with or being classified by them. A Civil Campaign is a book late in a space opera series that is mostly a romantic comedy about marriage and edible bug byproducts.</p>


<p>Both of these are favourite books of mine in the following senses:</p>


<ul>
<li>My life is significantly improved by having read them.</li>
<li>I would unambiguously recommend them to anyone who thought they sounded appealing.</li>
<li>There is no book I strictly prefer to them.</li>
</ul>


<p>Which of these books do I like better? I don't think the question makes sense.
Each book serves a very different role for me, and those roles are not at all interchangeable.</p>


<p>There is an idea in economics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference">revealed preferences</a>, which suggests that preferences can be inferred from behaviour. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">Von Neumann-Morgenstern Utility Theory</a> uses a similar idea to attach a single scalar utility value to a set of things being chosen over. These may both be true in some sense, but a naive adoption of them hides something very important: How incredibly context sensitive choices between objects are.</p>


<p>You might imagine that you can find out which of these books I prefer by asking me to make decisions, but the problem is that which book I choose will be heavily influenced by how you ask the question.</p>


<p>Some possible variants:</p>


<ul>
<li>If I had to give away one of these books, which would I pick? A Civil Campaign, because Sorting Things Out costs more to replace. (Advantage: Sorting Things Out)</li>
<li>If I were given an extra copy of one of these books, which would I pick? A Civil Campaign again, because I know many more people who would enjoy it than the former and I'd gift that on. (Advantage: A Civil Campaign)</li>
<li>If I could only ever read one of these books again, which would I pick? Sorting Things Out, because I use and refer to its ideas much more often. (Advantage: Sorting Things Out)</li>
<li>If I were stuck on a desert island with one of these books, which would I pick? A Civil Campaign, because it's much more emotionally comforting to reread and I'm not likely to be up to much more than that on a desert island. (Advantage: A Civil Campaign)</li>
</ul>


<p>One way to think of this is in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency">pareto optimality</a>: You can only count a book as better than another if it is better in all degrees. I think this is too strong - for example I'd consider either of these books better than, say, The Tao of Pooh, because I consider the latter to be a dreadful book that I would not recommend to anyone. Are there senses in which The Tao of Pooh is better than either of these books? Yeah, probably. It's more accessible than Sorting Things Out for example, but I would still say Sorting Things Out is the unambiguously better book.</p>


<p>Nevertheless, I think it is still true that many pairs of books are <em>incommensurable</em> - you cannot readily say that one of these things is better than the other, because "better" is so context dependent. Further, nothing about this is book specific - the same is true for meals, films, people, and almost everything else. Context is important a driver of preference between objects as the objects themselves.</p>


<p>You can certainly demand that I reduce those contexts to probabilities, and make decisions about what I would prefer in each context to reveal my preferences, in order decide which one I strictly prefer by comparing the resulting subjective utilities.</p>


<p>To this demand, I offer the following rebuttal: Nope. Shan't.</p>
