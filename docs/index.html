<p class="subtitle">Teach me of your human notions of love</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-15</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2y3eU3x">Finding Our Sea-Legs</a>, p 41:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it is not the oldest philosophical question in the book, but is one of the most recurrent, at least once puberty has kicked in: "What is this thing called love?"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Well, lets see what the book has to say about it. From Tiffany Watt Smith's <a href="https://amzn.to/2Lu4EEF">The Book of Human Emotions</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Is there anything left to say about love? Reams of poetry and songs, libraries' worth of philosophy, are dedicated to trying to express it, to understand and define it. The very volume of words tells us not only how much there is to say on the subject, but also how little can be said with any certainty.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Thanks Tiffany, that's very helpful.</p>


<p>Buckingham, on page 42, suggests that unlike philosophy (which asks questions like "What is love?"), storytelling tends to ask "What is love <em>like</em>?".</p>


<p>He is quick to point out the flaw in this question (on page 43):</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Here, however, we need to be philosophically cautious. The way that this second question is phrased, "What is love like?" risks seducing us into thinking that there <em>is</em> in fact, a single thing, love, towards which this new question will lead us. But the more we ask this kind of question, the more it becomes apparent that love is no more a single thing than is death. What emerges from our storytelling is not Love, but a multiplicity of loves.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This multiplicity of loves is, I think, part of the core of the practical problems of love. In reality, we are not so much interested in the question "What is love like?" any more than we are interested in the question "What is love?". What we want to know tends to be questions more like:</p>


<ul>
<li>Do they love me?</li>
<li>Do I love them?</li>
<li>How do I find someone who will love me?</li>
<li>How do I love myself?</li>
</ul>


<p>I think we will find that when we ask these questions they will not always mean the the same notion of love.</p>


<p>Love, like most things, doesn't really have a formal definition - you can look it up in a dictionary, but dictionaries describe use rather than providing authoritative definitions, and the dictionary's selection of meanings for love are particularly useless.</p>


<p>Most words used in practice are defined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostensive_definition">ostensively</a>, meaning that we point to a bunch of examples and hope that you can figure out the general pattern because we sure as hell don't know how explain it to you.</p>


<p>This is particularly tricky for things which are primarily phenomenological - purely or predominantly aspects of our subjective experience. We barely have a coherent vocabulary for talking about <em>pain</em>, and pain is at least relatively easy to reproduce on demand. How is this supposed to work for things like love, which are vastly more complicated, and which you cannot easily point to an example?</p>


<p>Buckingham's answer is to let go of the question and embrace this plurality. I think this concedes too much, because it runs into a substantial problem: We can <em>disagree</em> what love is.</p>


<p>I've talked about Bell Hooks's notion of love as "The will to extend one's self for the purpose of one's own or another's spiritual growth". I think this is a <em>good</em> definition. It's not true, in that I don't think one can meaningfully assign a truth value to the question of whether that is what love <em>is</em>, but I think that it provides a good starting point for reasoning about many of the positive aspects of love.</p>


<p>But it's certainly not a definition that everyone can agree on.</p>


<p>David Chapman talks about <a href="https://meaningness.com/nebulosity">nebulosity</a>, the cloudlike nature of things - clouds are ill defined at the boundary. If you ask "What is the weight of a cloud?" you will end up with uncertainty that is in some sense fundamentally ontological (concerned with categories - which bits of matter do you consider "part of the cloud"?) rather than epistemic (concerned with knowledge - trying to pin down facts of empirical reality). Some parts of reality are clearly part of the cloud, some parts of reality are clearly not part of the cloud, but at the boundary there is a region where it's... kinda part of the cloud but it's not really clear, and the answer to your question about the mass of the cloud will depend on how we decide that question of categorisation.</p>


<p>When you ask "Do I love them?" you will experience this nebulosity of love: Some people the answer is obviously no, hopefully some people the answer is obviously yes, but if you are asking the question you are probably in that boundary zone where the answer is the rather frustating "It depends what you mean by love?".</p>


<p>But when you ask "Do they love me?" the question is more complicated yet.</p>


<p>Not everyone has the same notion of love. Some notions of love are different, and some notions of love are better than others (there's no total ordering here - it's <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-17-10:16.html">very unlikely that there's a single best notion of love</a>). Many notions of love that we see in common use are coercive, abusive, or proprietary. "I would love you more if you changed to be what I want", "I hurt you because I love you", or "I love you, so you are mine".</p>


<p>In those cases the difficulty is still one of ontology. There are still questions about where the boundary of love is, but that boundary is now not merely fuzzy but contested. This is no longer a collaboration where you are trying to pin down an area of uncertainty, but a fight over the correct positioning of that boundary.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Joy in Sadness</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2T377tI">A Field Guide to Getting Lost</a>, pages 118-119:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>There is a voluptuous pleasure in all that sadness, and I wonder where it comes from, because as we usually construe the world, sadness and pleasure should be far apart. Is it that the joy that comes from other people always risks sadness, because even when love doesn't fail, mortality enters in; is it that there is a place where sadness and joy are not distinct, where all emotion lies together, a sort of ocean into which the tributary streams of distinct emotions go, a faraway deep inside; is it that such sadness is only the side effect of art that describes the depths of our lives, and to see that described in all its potential for loneliness and pain is beautiful? There are songs of insurgent power; they are essentially what rock and roll, an outgrowth of one strain of the blues, does best, these songs of being young and at the beginning of the world, full of a sense of your own potential. Country, at least the old stuff, has mostly been devoted instead to aftermath, to the hard work it takes to keep going or the awareness that comes after it is no longer possible to go on. If it is deeper than rock it is because failure is deeper than success. Failure is what we learn from, mostly.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I find that I am reluctant to write about this passage, partly because I do not fully understand it.</p>


<p>Is there pleasure in sadness? Well, there can be of course. That which grounds you in your body is often easy to experience as pleasurable, at least until it becomes too intense, or you become bored of it, and you dissociate in order to numb yourself away from it. Feelings are experienced bodily, so can be a source of pleasure, even when those feelings are sadness - they connect you up with yourself, and you can revel in that connection.</p>


<p>But joy? I don't know. Sadness and joy <em>do</em> seem opposed to me.</p>


<p>Perhaps the problem is that I don't really know what joy is.
I've been trying to figure out how to expand my positive emotional range, and this lack of understanding of joy is part of that.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/3bqscos">The Book of Human Emotions</a>, Tiffany Watt Smith cites Spinoza:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Believing the stories of our lives were fundamentally beyond our control, Spinoza linked joyfulness to the accidental and unforeseen. It surges up when something is better than we can possibly have imagined. "Joy is pleasure accompanied by the idea of something past, which has had an issue <em>beyond our hope</em>."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So perhaps there <em>can</em> be a joy in sadness. We are bad at self-reflection, and an upswelling of sadness (if we do not ignore it) grounds us, shows us an aspect of who we are that we didn't know was there. Accompanied with the pleasure of being grounded in ourself, it's like the sudden appearance of an old friend. A joyous greeting ensues: "Hello, what are you doing here? I didn't expect to see you here at at all."</p>


<p>But certainly not all sadness prompts joy, as I think we are collectively discovering in the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/avyfain/status/1260832192030097409">Avy observed the following earlier today</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Mindfulness is all about being fully present, and not letting your mind slip into thinking about past or future. It feels good.</p>
<p>At the same time, months of isolation have been all about the right now. Living in an infinite present is awful.</p>
<p>Not sure how to reconcile this.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this reading of joy has something to add here.</p>


<p>Mindfulness can definitely be experienced as pleasure - I do, and honestly it's usually a bit too much for me to handle for more than short periods of time - but fundamentally undifferentiated pleasure is <em>boring</em>.</p>


<p>You can see this when you use attention to turn off pain.</p>


<p>The next time you're experiencing pain, focus your attention on it. You can often turn it off, or reframe it as interesting and enjoyable (whether this works is somewhat variable. For example I can't do this with headaches). But how long will you last doing it? If you're like me, lasting more than scant minutes is impossible - at some point the pain becomes preferable to the boredom.</p>


<p>Perhaps this is a lack of skill, and once one is at the point where one can sustain a two hour seated meditation, the boredom is entirely manageable, or perhaps even the boredom can be experienced as pleasurable. I don't know. Meditation is not among my skills.</p>


<p>But I suspect most people lack the skill to reframe boredom as pleasurable.</p>


<p>If joy is pleasure in the unexpected, then it is no surprise that mindfulness can bring joy in a way that the eternal now of pandemic time cannot, because mindfulness comes with a suspension of judgement that we, for the most part, cannot manage all the time.</p>


<p><a href="https://meaningness.com/wonder">David Chapman recently wrote about wonder</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I suggest that wonder occurs in heightened agendaless attention combined with suspension of habitual interpretation. Heightened agendaless attention allows and perceives unexpected patterning; suspension of habitual interpretation allows and perceives unexpected nebulosity.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(<a href="https://meaningness.com/nebulosity">nebulosity</a> is a term he uses in a technical sense idiosyncratic to his meaningness project. Nebulosity is the property of things that seem well defined to become vague at their boundaries)</p>


<p>I propose that this suspension of habitual interpretation is also one of the key differences between mindfulness and pandemic time. We experience joy because we are able to put aside, for a moment, our interpretation and thus our understanding, so whatever comes next will be equally surprising.</p>


<p>In the pandemic we are not able to do that, partly because we are not able to maintain this suspension for long periods of time anyway, and partly because it is <em>hard</em> to suspend interpretation when we are under threat.
Interpretation is a key part of our threat assessment and merely <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">knowing</a> that doesn't help us feel safe enough to do it.</p>


<p>And without this suspension of interpretation, without the perpetual surprise that comes with it, an eternal now is not a joyous experience. We experience only the sadness, without the ability to joyously revel in it, because we <em>know</em> what is there, and we are bored of it.</p>


<p>And without that joy, the eternal now takes a darker turn, because although an eternal now is experienced in mindfulness, it is also a symptom of depression.</p>


<p>I've <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html">written before</a> about Matthew Ratcliffe's book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3fJk71w">Experiences of Depression</a>, and his notion of <em>existential feelings</em> - feelings which lack an aboutness, but are instead part of the background structure of our experience of reality. Feelings associated with the passage of time are a significant type of existential feeling.</p>


<p>Ratcliffe proposes that much of the depressive experience can be thought of as disruption to existential feelings. Given that, it's not surprising that we can experience the disruption to the passage of time as depression. Also, for those of us already prone to depression, I suspect that some disruption to existential feelings can prompt a broader depressive episode, through trained associations and kicking off feedback loops that drive us deeper into this depression.</p>


<p>What defines the difference between whether a disruption to the passage of time causes depression or joy?</p>


<p>I suspect part of it is <em>agency</em>. In mindfulness, we are in a situation which we can choose to end whenever we need to. We have voluntarily entered into that state. It's a weird, inverted, image of the difference between a rollercoaster and a genuine threat: Because we are there voluntarily, the experience of the fear is qualitatively different even when the level of fear may be the same. Because we have chosen to suspend our experience of time, we can maintain an open curiousity, and can experience that disruption as joyous.</p>


<p>What does all this mean?</p>


<p>Well, it suggests at least three routes for dealing with the eternal now.</p>


<p>The first is that we can end it. We can take steps to texture time for ourselves. I've been working on this a bit recently and so far my experience is that it's good but also doesn't work. Previously I was living day to day, now I'm living week to week. The world is textured but still small.</p>


<p>The second is that we can cultivate agency without the eternal now. We may not be able to deal with it, but we can start projects, we can control that which we have access to. I think many people are taking this route.</p>


<p>The third, which is hardest and I barely know where to start, but ultimately may be the only option that works, is that we can try to learn to take joy in it. We can practice curiousity, reconcile ourselves to the endlessness in all of it, and try to explore the details of the world that is available to us. Maybe we'll be surprised by what we find there.</p>

<p class="subtitle">How to read a book</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-13</dd>
</dl>


<p>I have mixed feelings about Adler and Van Doren's classic <a href="https://amzn.to/2LqWf50">How to read a book</a>. There's a lot I like about it, and my reading definitely improved after I read it, but I also disagree with a lot of it. I have not engaged with the book in a way that they think entitles me to disagree with it, but that's OK because I also disagree with their claims around when you are entitled to disagree with a book.</p>


<p>But that's not what this post is about. This post is about what one might think of the central failing of the book: Despite the title, it never actually tells you how to read a book.
It is not a book about how to read a book at all, it is a book about how to engage with the contents of a book.</p>


<p>This is not what reading is.
Reading is not an act conducted by a pure mind engaging with an idealised platonic flow of information.
Reading is an active engagement between a physical body and a physical object. The <em>purpose</em> of reading is to engage with the content, but reading itself is a physical act.</p>


<p>And the physical act matters, clearly.</p>


<p>This is obvious in the extreme cases. If you are in constant pain while reading you're not going to be able to concentrate on the reading, right? But I think it matters far more than we expect it to.</p>


<p>People often are amused at how strong my opinions on book formats are, but this is because book formats are important.</p>


<p>Briefly my opinions on book formats are:</p>


<ol>
<li>Audiobooks might be fine but I haven't been able to make them work for me (I should revisit this now that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-11-14:47.html">I have solved my problems with podcasts</a>)</li>
<li>Ebooks are a shit format for consuming hard material, but their convenience often outweighs their shittiness for lighter material.</li>
<li>Most hardbacks are a bad format made by bad people.</li>
<li>Trade paperbacks and other large paperback formats are a blight on humanity and the people responsible for them should be put on trial.</li>
<li>Small, light, ideally paperback, books are the god tier format and are the only one that allows you to properly engage with difficult material.</li>
</ol>


<p>You will tell me about textbooks etc that have too much content to be small and thus are better as large physical books or PDFs. I acknowledge those textbooks cannot be made smaller, but I contend that this is because they shouldn't have been written with that much content in the first place and should have been a series of shorter books. This is a separate argument.</p>


<p>The reason why ebooks are bad is twofold:</p>


<ul>
<li>The physicality of engaging with a book is actually very helpful for organising knowledge (you've got an intuitive sense of where things were in the book, and also physical libraries are a much better exobrain that digital ones).</li>
<li>They add significant latency and inconvenience to many of the actions you take in the course of reading (paging, especially backwards, flicking through the book at random, etc).</li>
</ul>


<p>The reason large physical books are bad is that it is almost impossible to maintain <a href="https://learnmuscles.com/blog/2017/10/18/reading-writing-and-posture/">a proper reading posture while reading them</a> without a book stand or something, which let's be honest literally nobody is using. They also can't be carried in your bag (and a book stand certainly can't), which means your opportunities to read them will be limited.</p>


<p>Why am I telling you all of this?</p>


<p>I'm telling you all of this because if the physicality of reading matters, and you are struggling to read, then you may be able to improve your reading not by "improving your reading skills" in some sense, or by fixing whatever is stopping you from concentrating, but by simply changing actual practical physical details about your reading habits. It's possible that you're just fine at reading but are attempting to read in a way that doesn't work well for you.</p>


<p>Here are some interventions in the act of reading that have all worked pretty well for me:</p>


<ol>
<li>Reading out loud. Reading out loud makes it <em>much</em> easier to engage with difficult material. It causes you to remember it better, and the act of reading out loud <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:12.html">makes it harder in a way that makes it possible to concentrate</a></li>
<li>Explicitly structuring your reading into a 20/10 pattern (20 minutes reading, 10 minutes mandatory break) so as to manage fatigue and concentration better.</li>
<li>Fix your reading posture so that you hold the book out in front of you rather than looking down at it. The looking down posture is not good for your neck and breathing in a way that I think disrupts the ability to concentrate and makes you feel more distracted while reading.</li>
<li>Reading while standing up (with the book held in front of you!) and vaguely walking or pacing is particularly good. This combines particularly well with reading out loud.</li>
<li>Reading while <a href="https://alexandertechnique.co.uk/learning-it/semi-supine">Semi-Supine</a> with the book held out in front of you. This combines particularly well with the 20/10 structure, with your phone deliberately left out of reach.</li>
</ol>


<p>All of these seem kinda dumb and like they shouldn't matter, because we have become overly attached to the idea of books as pure sources of information that we engage with intellectually, rather than physical objects that we interact with physically as part of a process with an intellectual goal, and little things often have a much larger effect on such processes than we think they do.</p>


<p>They're all also very easy, so if you really think they won't work, the fastest way to prove me wrong is to just <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">try them and see what happens</a>.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Why are things hard?</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-12</dd>
</dl>


<p>I've recently started a <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/coming-soon">Substack Newsletter</a> called "How to do hard things", based on <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">my unexpectedly popular post of the same name</a>.</p>


<p>There will be a lot of overlap between the newsletter and this notebook. I'm not quite sure how I'm going to use it yet, but I'm expecting there will be a bit of a back and forth, with the newsletter being a place I use to collect and develop themes I've written about here, which will in turn spark more notebook posts here. If you're enjoying the notebook, I'd also recommend subscribing to the substack. For now at least, you don't need to sign up for a paid tier - the content is the same for all subscribers, but with the discussion / community features turned on for paid ones.</p>


<p>Anyway, this has got me thinking about The Fully General System For Learning To Do Hard Things. I still think it's a good framework, but I think it's missing a lot of important features - some of which only require additions to it, some of which might require some modifications.</p>


<p>One of the principle problems with it is, I think, the fact that what it <em>does</em> is extremely under defined. What is a "hard thing"? And how does one learn to do it?</p>


<p>The principle assumption in the post is that things are hard because you lack the skill to do them effortlessly. It's true, some things are like that. But that's a relatively tiny fraction of the ways in which things can be hard, and most things that are hard in one way are hard in multiple, not necessarily easily distinguishable, ways.</p>


<p>The Fully General System as previously described really only admits three possible reasons why things might be hard:</p>


<ul>
<li>You might not know how to do them.</li>
<li>You might know how to do them but not be able to execute.</li>
<li>You might not know exactly what it is you're trying to do.</li>
</ul>


<p>But there are quite a few other ways in which things can be hard.
Here is a partial list:</p>


<ul>
<li>You might lack some simple trick.</li>
<li>You might be <em>wrong</em> about what it is you're trying to do.</li>
<li>You might lack resources that you need to do them.</li>
<li>You might lack motivation to do them.</li>
<li>You might find the whole subject of doing them aversive.</li>
<li>There might be some <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-11-14:47.html">trivial irritation</a> preventing you from doing the thing.</li>
<li>You might lack a foundational skill that they need but that isn't obvious.</li>
<li>You might be doing something foundational very badly.</li>
<li>You might lack awareness of or access to the expertise you need to learn how to do the thing.</li>
<li>You might need someone to help you do them.</li>
<li>You might be rusty at the relevant skills.</li>
<li>Someone else might be trying to stop you doing them.</li>
<li>The thing you are trying to do might have unacceptable consequences.</li>
<li>There might be social norms making it hard to do the thing in the easy way.</li>
<li>It might not be worth doing the thing.</li>
<li>The thing might be intrinsically hard in ways that require you to just do a lot of wor.</li>
<li>The thing might be intrinsically uncertain, making reliable success impossible.</li>
<li>The thing might be risky (and thus unsafe to experiment with while learning).</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally there are a whole bunch of general reasons why doing <em>anything</em> might be hard for you:</p>


<ul>
<li>You might not have enough time.</li>
<li>You might have a distracting environment.</li>
<li>You might not be getting enough sleep.</li>
<li>You might be depressed.</li>
<li>You might have ADHD.</li>
<li>You might have other mental health problems.</li>
<li>You might have physical health problems.</li>
<li>You might lack more general skills around learning and habit formation.</li>
<li>You might lack more general skills around debugging why things are hard.</li>
</ul>


<p>In general, most hard things are some mix of multiple of these things, and usually not a small number of them, and any truly general system for learning to do hard things must take this into account.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Building and Rebuilding Foundational Skills</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-05-11</dd>
</dl>


<p>I have a problem: I'm kinda OK at statistics.</p>


<p>Why is this a problem? Being kinda OK seems... kinda OK, right?</p>


<p>Well, it would be, but the problem isn't that I have an intermediate level of statistical skill. The problem is that I have a broad range of statistical skill, all of which I'm kinda OK at. I'm kinda OK at elementary statistics, and I'm kinda OK at advanced statistics too.</p>


<p>This is a real problem for learning more, because it is <em>hard</em> to relearn basics because they feel too basic for my skill level.</p>


<p>I have another problem: Climbing is a fun sport that makes a good social activity and works on a number of strength skills that I would like to work on. Also I give myself a back injury 100% of the time I do it, because my ability to climb is much greater than my skill at climbing, because I'm hypermobile and have a decent strength to body weight ratio, and the result is that despite some things feeling easy, I do them badly and this results in me inadvertently harming myself while doing them.</p>


<p>All of these share a common theme: It is possible for something to be easy while still being bad at it, and this is especially true with foundational skills, where you've built capabilities on top of them, and going back and relearning the basics is hard and boring.</p>


<p>In order to get good at statistics, I'd need to grind a bunch of exercises that I frankly feel are beneath me.
I'm probably going to try (despite my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-03-09:09.html">complicated feelings about mathematics</a>) because being good at statistics is important for me professionally and spiritually, and I'll never get good at it until I sort out the basics, and also being bad at those basics risks me tripping up in stupid ways.</p>


<p>In order to get good at climbing, I'd need to very carefully (and probably with supervision) try far easier routes than I can manage, and stop far sooner than it seems like I can. I'd have to deliberately hold myself back until I was much better at the basics than I am, despite my ability to do more. I don't value climbing enough at present to do this, so I probably will just avoid climbing.</p>


<p>Anyway, this is is why I'm currently restarting the first week of Couch to 5K despite having completed it relatively easily.</p>


<p>Here's another problem: I obviously breathe badly.</p>


<p>I'm not fully sold on the Buteyko method, which encourages you to breathe less and entirely through your nose, but I obviously mouth breathe at night based on my sleep quality and dry mouth in the morning, and my peak flow numbers aren't great. I'd like to work on this to the point where I breathe through my nose unconsciously and easily, even while sleeping. It probably won't change my life in the way that the Buteyko method promises (though it sure would be nice if it did!), but at the very least it might improve my sleep quality.</p>


<p>Breathing is definitely a foundational skill, and it's one I'm bad at, so I'd like to work on it, and working on breathing is <em>deathly</em> boring.</p>


<p>This is where I link in three previous tools:</p>


<p>I can nose breathe just fine while at rest. I can complete couch to 5k week one (consistent of eight repetitions of a 60 second run followed by a 90 second walk) just fine. What I absolutely cannot do is complete Couch to 5K week one while nasal breathing. I can just about manage the first run and then I am <em>wrecked</em>.</p>


<p>I think this is the way to rebuild foundations, and one of the core reasons why <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-21-10:04.html">learning a different skill</a> is often essential for progressing at your current goal: By transferring to a different context where the foundational skill is no longer easy, it becomes a thing that you can now actively work at. Working on a foundation in its existing context is often too easy to be possible, so <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:12.html">the way to work on it is to make it harder</a>.</p>


<p>I was in fact, already considering restarting week one of Couch to 5K, for two other reasons, both of which are also about foundational skills.</p>


<p>As well as breathing, I'm also bad at walking.</p>


<p>Yes, I'm aware that these are both ridiculous things to be bad at. I think a lot of you reading this are probably bad at them too though. As I said, we have <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html">a widespread lack of the basic skills of being a human being</a>.</p>


<p>Specifically, I have quite flat feet and weak arches, and a bunch of (probably) related joint pain. I've tried wearing arch support shoes and my considered opinion is that it was an expensive waste of time. (Well, it was a good <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">experiment</a>).</p>


<p>A slightly less fringe (but still fringe) opinion is that the solution to this is actually to have <em>less</em> arch support, and to wear barefoot shoes that are designed to protect your feet without supporting them,
because this causes you to actually develop your muscles rather than weaken them.</p>


<p>This seems worth a shot, and I was noticing that my ankles were already starting to hurt a bit as a result of week one. I don't want to end up in the situation like with climbing where my ability to do a run exceeds my ability to do a run without injuring myself, so this too seems like a thing I could reasonably make harder in order to work on the foundational skills of.</p>


<p>Even without these foundations of breathing and walking, I was still thinking it might be worth repeating Couch to 5K, because I disagree with some of its philosophical premises.</p>


<p>Couch to 5K is designed to ramp up the difficulty level by making you run more, and more consistently. I personally think it ramps up the difficulty too quickly. I basically agree with Sarah Perry's point in <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/03/body-pleasure/">Body Pleasure</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[...] people enjoy exercise up to a certain level of intensity, which varies for each person. Most people who do low-intensity exercise feel better during the mild exertion. At the point when the body can no longer maintain levels of oxygen and (separately) lactate in the muscles, the exercise becomes so intense that basic affect (feeling good or feeling bad, the lowest-level evaluation of anything) plummets. Everybody feels terrible when they exercise too hard. Once people rest for a few minutes, they start feeling good again. However, this may not be enough such that people evaluate the entire experience as pleasurable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most on-ramps to exercise are at an intensity too high for previously-sedentary people to find them pleasurable. If people go to a fitness class, or focus on running a particular distance at a particular speed, they’ll likely miss the pleasure zone entirely. Refocusing on exercising only for one’s own individual pleasure, as slowly as one prefers, and only at intensities that are pleasurable, is more likely to motivate repeat and habitual exercising. At that point, the enjoyment of exercise pleasure can build on itself, motivating longer and longer intervals of experiencing the pleasure. I summarize Ekkekakis et al.’s result as: “learn to exercise out of extreme selfish laziness.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I was a little skeptical about doing Couch to 5K because one of the things I'm trying to work on at the moment is to enjoy exercise, and honestly I don't enjoy running. I'd already been vaguely considering restarting week one so that I could get to the point where it was pleasurable rather than merely endurable.</p>


<p>I liked <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1258846038552489984">David Laing's point the other day</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Advice on how to get better at a given thing should often be replaced with advice on how to take more pleasure in doing that thing.</p>
<p>Pleasure doesn't lead directly to learning, but it leads to <em>volume</em>, which leads to learning. Also pleasure is an end in itself.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I don't know exactly how to create pleasure in a thing, but I suspect fluidity is a huge part of it. There is something intrinsically pleasurable about being good enough at something hard that you can do it automatically and reliably, and I think fluidity is extremely helpful for being able to play with a skill.</p>


<p>I suspect this points to a general reason why we are so often bad at foundations: We treat the point at which we should progress as to when we <em>can</em> do the thing, when in fact we should be progressing when it's <em>pleasurable</em> to do it (or at least fluid where pleasure is impossible). This ties in to the idea that you are not good at doing a thing until you are able to do it reliably rather than able to do it at all.</p>


<p>If you progress as soon as you clear some minimum bar of being <em>able</em> to do it, then what happens is that the skill will get progressively more and more frustrating as you move up it until you hit some "natural" limit where your frustration exceeds your willingness to progress, and you can no longer easily go back and work on the foundations, so you conclude that you're now as good as you're goign to get.</p>


<p>For reasons, I was reading about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem">Bloom's 2 sigma problem</a> recently, which is often used as evidence for the superiority of private tutoring over general classes, but I found the description of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_learning">mastery learning</a>, which is the specific system being compared, especially interesting:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Mastery learning maintains that students must achieve a level of mastery (e.g., 90% on a knowledge test) in prerequisite knowledge before moving forward to learn subsequent information. If a student does not achieve mastery on the test, they are given additional support in learning and reviewing the information and then tested again. This cycle continues until the learner accomplishes mastery, and they may then move on to the next stage.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In comparison, I think most of our school based learning techniques are like Couch to 5K: They assume that there is some straightforward time frame on which you can expect people to progress, and you should progress as long as you can just about manage the previous level, and failure to progress is a sign of significant failure.</p>


<p>How much of the 2 sigma system is about the benefits of individual instruction, and how much of it is just about giving people the time to build their foundations before progressing?</p>


<p>This all fits in well to the framework of the <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/">Fully General System for Learning to Do Hard Things</a>, but I think I have previously neglected something important: It's not at all obvious what <em>hard</em> and <em>easy</em> mean in this context. I suspect the threshold for progression should be set much higher than I previously would have set it.</p>


<p>Couch to 5K fits pretty well into the Fully General System, in that it repeatedly takes something that you can do (Week N) and makes it slightly harder (Week N + 1), eventually culminating in being able to do a half hour run. It seems pretty good, for a lot of people, in that it gets them to do something that would previously have seemed unattainable, but I'm no longer convinced that either it or the Fully General System are good enough for that.</p>


<p>I think this notion of foundational skills, and the question of mastery progression, point to a common flaw in Couch to 5K and the Fully General System: They are overly narrowly focused on the goal, and don't care about what possible future progress they burn along the way to getting there.</p>


<p>So I'm still going to try to do hard things, and I'm still going to complete Couch to 5K, but in doing so my aims are not merely to do a half hour run but to do a half hour run while breathing entirely through my nose, wearing barefoot shoes, and enjoying it, and all the while paying attention to the process and using it to learn more about progression and skill development in general.</p>
