<p class="subtitle">Writing from the heart</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2022-01-01</dd>
</dl>


<p>I've been thinking about types of writing recently, and in particular about the following section from Hillary Rettig's excellent "7 Secrets of the prolific":</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Grandiosity is a problem for writers because our media and culture are permeated with grandiose myths and misconceptions about writing, which writers who are undermentored fall prey to. Red Smith’s famous bon mot about how, to write, you need only “sit down at a typewriter and open a vein,” and Gene Fowler’s similarly sanguinary advice to “sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until the drops of blood form on your forehead,” are nothing but macho grandiose posturing, as is William Faulkner’s overwrought encomium to monomaniacal selfishness, from his Paris Review interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The writer’s only responsibility is to his art. He will be completely ruthless if he is a good one. He has a dream. It anguishes him so much he must get rid of it. He has no peace until then. Everything goes by the board: honor, pride, decency, security, happiness, all, to get the book written. If a writer has to rob his mother, he will not hesitate; the “Ode on a Grecian Urn” is worth any number of old ladies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many of the most famous quotes about writing are grandiose. I’m not saying that all of these writers were posturing—perhaps that’s how they truly perceived themselves and their creativity. What I do know is that, for most writers, a strategy based on pain and deprivation is not a route to productivity. In fact, it is more likely a route to a block.</p>
<p>I actually find quotes about how awful writing and the writing life are to be not just perfectionist, but self-indulgent. No one’s forcing these writers to write, after all, and there are obviously far worse ways to spend one’s time, not to mention earn one’s living. </p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think Rettig is, broadly, right here about how most people should be writing most of the time, but I must admit that of all the wisdom in this section the one that's stuck with me is the line she's disagreeing with.</p>


<p><a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/09/14/writing-bleed/">According to Quote Investigator</a>, Red Smith's full line is: </p>


<blockquote>
<p>You simply sit down at the typewriter, open your veins, and bleed.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think about this a lot because, contra Rettig, writing be like that sometimes.</p>


<p>It's useful to compare and contrast two recent newsletter issues of mine. <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/labelling-feelings">Labelling feelings 101</a> and <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/first-hard-choice">The first hard choice</a>.</p>


<p>Labelling feelings 101 was not a particularly taxing piece to write. It's just a summary of lots of things I've thought about. There's a moderate amount of myself in there, but only because it's explaining how I look at things. It's a look at part of the world through my eyes, but it's just explanatory prose, it's nothing particularly revealing.</p>


<p>The first hard choice on the other hand is weirder and more personal. I started writing, and then I continued writing, and it went in a very different direction than I intended. The underlying thought process is non-obvious, but I think it comes through that I'm writing about something that actually matters to me.</p>


<p>Tellingly, "Labelling feelings 101" has got more attention (it's certainly useful to more people) but "The first hard choice" has got more praise (and also more people checking in to make sure that I'm OK).</p>


<p>Writing is, a lot of the time, a way of expressing something deeply felt. You write from the heart, and it's hard to do that without bleeding onto the page.</p>


<p>Most writing isn't, and shouldn't, be like this. If you're writing an email to a coworker it doesn't have to express some profound truth. If you're writing some basic copy explaining how a product works, same. But if you're writing about your life, or about things that are personally important to you, and you are <em>never</em> doing this, then you're probably holding your feelings at arms length, and that isn't great.</p>


<p>Am I being grandiose? Rettig would probably think so, and maybe I am. But some things are actually important, and it's hard to talk about that without sounding a little grandiose, and maybe that's OK.</p>


<p>I don't do this sort of writing enough, and I'd like to do it more - every time I have it's been in some way transformative.</p>


<p>In order to achieve this, I've come up with a very detailed and elaborate plan: I'm going to do it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The landscape of</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-12-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>One of the features of <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/labelling-feelings">my working model of emotions</a> is that they exist as a tendency towards behaviours. Anger is a tendency to behave angrily, etc.</p>


<p>This tendency is experienced as something like the default thing that happens if you don't put in energy to avoid it happening. It's not that behaving angrily is inevitable when you are angry, it's that it is more work to avoid behaving angrily than it is to behave angrily. You have to constantly choose not to behave angrily.</p>


<p>I was having a miserable day yesterday, and I was wondering... what is that? What is miserable? Is it an emotion?</p>


<p>I want to say that miserable is not an emotion because it lacks intentionality, it's not about something (although there's some linguistic ambiguity - I feel like one can be miserable about specific things as well, but there's miserable-about and there's just miserable, and it's the latter I'm pointing to).</p>


<p>I want to say that miserable is not an emotion but a <em>mood</em>.</p>


<p>What's a mood? Well, a mood is to emotions as emotions are to behaviour: A tendency towards.</p>


<p>This ties into Ratcliffe and his notion of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html">Depression as constituted by existential feelings</a>,
and in particular as a restriction on the set of possible emotions, which suggests that "tendency towards" may be insufficiently strong in its connotations. Sometimes that tendency is overwhelming: A feeling of hopelessness creates not just a "tendency" against hope, but a feeling that hope is itself impossible.
Moods contain not just slopes but also walls.</p>


<p>Does this in turn go back to emotions and behaviours? I think it does. If I'm absolutely furious with someone I may be able to behave calmly with them, but I probably can't behave warmly to them - I can go through the motions, but I will probably seem stiff and artificial (because I will be) because I do not have full control over my body language, and have to fight against my natural tendencies.</p>


<p>So perhaps a better way to think of emotions and behaviour is not the tendency towards behaviours but the landscape of behaviour. It is the set of hills and valleys and walls that behaviour operates in. You can apply energy to move up a slope, you probably can't move up a wall, but as soon as you stop applying energy you will fall into the local minimum.</p>


<p>Moods in turn are the landscape of emotions.</p>


<p>What is the landscape of mood?</p>


<p>I was going to say that it's temperament, but that isn't quite right. It's some combination of temperament and environment - part of why I was miserable yesterday is definitely environmental, prompted by how grey and unpleasant the weather is.</p>


<p>In general this feels like a fruitful question to ask even outside the context of mood and emotion: When you have a space of possibilities, what constitutes the landscape for it?</p>

<p class="subtitle">Social reality as a game</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-11-23</dd>
</dl>


<p>We went out scrumping for drones earlier, and in the course of doing so I did something weird: I brought a mug of coffee with me.</p>


<p>This was weird not because I had coffee with me, that's normal, but because it was a normal ceramic mug that I was just wandering through the streets holding.</p>


<p>If it had been a paper cup that would have been fine, obviously. Similarly, a travel mug wouldn't have raised an eyebrow.
But a normal ceramic mug? That's weird.</p>


<p>Why was I carrying a mug? Well, I wasn't going far - the drone tree was only about five minutes walk away - and I didn't have a travel mug, but I'd just made coffee and I wanted to drink my coffee. Sure, I might drop it, but the solution to that was to not drop it (I didn't drop it).</p>


<p>It was a perfectly reasonable practical solution, but ceramic mugs are a home item not a travel item, so it was weird.</p>


<p>Bernard Suits defines a game as "the voluntary attempt to overcome unecessary obstacles", and I think about that a lot.</p>


<p>How voluntary does it have to be? </p>


<p>Clearly it's still a game if you give in to social pressure to play it, right? The fact that your family will sulk at you if you don't play doesn't make Yahtzee suddenly not a game (admittedly I could argue that it's not a game for other reasons, but it's certainly a Suitsian game in the sense that you're attempting to overcome your desire to die of boredom and the whole thing seems very unecessary. Also there are dice).</p>


<p>But who determines what's necessary?</p>


<p>More properly, the above his portable definition. He actually defines a game as:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude].</p>
</blockquote>


<p>He offers the example of mountain climbing: Your prelusory goal is to get to the top of the mountain, but the lusory means are that you have to climb it. If you could just take a helicopter up, you would not be playing the "game" of mountain climbing.</p>


<p>Here's what I wonder: How much of our behaviour is governed by things that are, effectively, constitutive rules of a social game? I was certainly refusing to follow voluntarily adopted rules that prohibited me from using the more efficient means that I was currently employing. Those rules are, in some sense, accepted just because they make possible the activity of society.</p>


<p>In carrying a ceramic mug around with me outside was I, in small part, refusing to play a game in which everyone is implicitly participating in all the time?
Maybe, but at least I got to drink my coffee.</p>


<p>We didn't manage to scrump any drones, incidentally.</p>

<p class="subtitle">My conception of parts work</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-11-15</dd>
</dl>


<p>I was recently talking to Kaj Sotala on discord about what I mean when I say "Self is a part", and I ended up writing the following set of theses about what I actually believe by tabooing the words "Self" and "part". I thought I'd capture that here rather than having to search discord for it in future. The following is a lightly edited version of my explanation on Discord.</p>


<p>Your emotional state can exhibit <em>stuck modes</em>, which are essentially a coherent bundle of emotional reactions that it is useful to conceptualise as person-like due to feeling like a discrete entity. The ideal is to have no stuck modes, but this ideal is probably only theoretically achievable.</p>


<p>Most of your broader mental and emotional capabilities do not neatly fit into a discrete set of such stuck modes, but are a more flexibly adoptable and combineable set of underlying mental/emotional resources that you can use to construct <em>attitudes</em> that are appropriate to the present context.</p>


<p>Many emotional problems correspond to stuck modes that are in some way unhappy, and that arose by essentially ossifying a particular set of responses from a past situation and being unable to grow past that point.</p>


<p>A useful set of mental motions is to essentially identify a stuck mode corresponding to a problem and adopt the attitude that that you would have needed from someone else at the time to not get stuck in that mode.</p>


<p>For many stuck modes this attitude corresponds to a sort of boundless love and acceptance. This is particularly likely to be the case for stuck modes that arose in childhood or romantic relationships, because there the problem arose from a lack of love from an external source.</p>


<p>This does not exhaust the possibilities of things that a stuck mode might need.
Additionally, due to the way we treat some of our stuck modes, a stuck mode may experience sufficient animosity to the broader self (lower case s - I mean "you overall", not anything corresponding to the IFS Self) that makes it unacceptable to it that you are the one providing the support it needs.</p>


<p>Untabooing now to explain the relationship: in this terminology, an exile is a "stuck mode", and "Self" is an attitude (or more likely a range of broadly similar attitudes), which aligns with "Self is not a part" if we want to consider "part" and "stuck mode" synonymous, but I often find it useful to construct temporary unstuck parts, which are essentially attitudes and not stuck modes.</p>


<p>Examples of attitudes that I don't think are particularly Self-like and help sometimes: Something closer to a mediator part that's mostly just there to help integrate two stuck modes by acting as an inbetween and asking good questions until they realise that they feel in opposition and are basically on the same side. Something that is more like a mentor than a parent who basically goes "Oh yeah that sucks, shall we figure out what to do about it?" at the part until it's able to treat its state as a practical problem to be resolved rather than an existential crisis.
And all of these have certain Self-like qualities to them (they require kindness, acceptance, etc) but the love is not the primary function.</p>


<p>Constructing a temporary part that is coherent enough to have a conversation with feels like roughly the same skill as coming up with a fictional character for your writing (at least the way I do it), by essentially coalescing an attitude and adding details that feel right until it feels relatively coherent. This is more work than accessing a stuck mode, but it's not necessarily a <em>lot</em> of work.</p>


<p>Conversely, I think stuck modes are often a bit fuzzy around the edges, and can essentially be dissolved (and indeed IFS often ends up resulting in a process of dissolving them - a healed exile has essentially been dissolved).</p>


<p>The result is that it's not so much that "Self" and "parts" in the IFS ontology are the same thing as that there is not a clean division between the two things, and there is not a single special state called Self that is fundamentally unlike the parts it's used to heal.</p>

<p class="subtitle">I'm not trapped in here with you</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-11-12</dd>
</dl>


<p>Content warning: Dark in a meta sort of way. There's probably a lot of bad shit that this could pattern match to, but probably the best test is that if the question "Am I a bad person?" carries much emotional weight for you, this piece is about that and may bring up related experiences.
This will also probably bring up any bad experiences with relationships, parents, etc. not because it's about that but because it features many similar dynamics.</p>


<p>This is another piece where I just have to start by telling you that I'm OK and asking you to trust me on that.</p>


<p>More accurately, I'm not OK, but not in any new way, and I'm probably more OK than most people.
I'm generalising from some offscreen examples and thought processes which are revealing interesting underlying problems that have been around for a long time, and I'm poking at them and learning about them as part of a process of fixing them. As a result, some dark stuff is coming up, but it's a positive and helpful thing that it is.</p>


<p>If you want a concrete set of problems to think about this piece in terms of, the two most obvious ways a lot of this comes up for me is discomfort with and inability to express anger in a wide variety of situations, and similarly levels of discomfort with an extremely normal level of sexual interest.</p>


<p>Also a lot of this piece is in the second person because that's how it naturally demanded to be written, but really the "you" in here is me.</p>


<h3>You're free now</h3>


<p>I want you to imagine a scenario: You're in jail, you have been for a very long time, possibly most of your life. </p>


<p>You are in jail for what seems to you an entirely innocuous event, or something barely a crime. You were jaywalking, you stole a loaf to feed your family,
you said the wrong thing to the wrong person and they took offence. You're not flawless, but you're pretty far from being a murderer. You did a normal and reasonable thing and are being disproportionately punished for it.</p>


<p>You still want all the things you wanted before you went to jail of course. If anything, you want them more, because you've been denied them for so long.
More than that, though, you want freedom, and you want justice for the wrong that has been done to you by trapping you here.</p>


<p>The guard has, for many years, been making clear that you will not get these things and you do not deserve these things.
You are bad, society is better off without you, you belong in this prison, so that other, decent, people are kept safe from the likes of you.
The guard isn't actively abusive, in the sense that he doesn't come in and beat you just for the sake of it,
but he does ample violence to you when you try to escape.</p>


<p>Sometimes you've even successfully escaped, for short times, but you are always caught and brought back to your cell,
and you are very much punished for your escape attempt, both with violence and with verbal shaming.</p>


<p>Then, one day, the judge who sentenced to this place comes to you, opens your cell door, and tells you this:
He has seen that what you want is no crime. He loves you, and looks at you with compassion in his heart, and he wants all the best for you,
and he recognises that really you all want the same things and you're all in this together. You are free to go.</p>


<p>If you do anything short of trying to literally murder the judge, you are probably a better person than me.</p>


<h3>The ontology part of the therapy session</h3>


<p>Let's talk about Internal Family Systems therapy.</p>


<p>I got into a discussion a few months back about whether IFS was just rebranded Jungian shadow work. The other person was saying it was, I said "Sure, seems plausible enough, though I think they've got a bit of a different toolkit". I've now decided that this is wrong, and that the distinction between the two is important.</p>


<p>At its core, IFS is a type of parts work. That is, it involves working with "parts of yourself", coherent bundles of emotional responses that it is useful to conceptualise as if they were their own entities ("Do parts literally exist?" is a subject on which opinions vary. I'm personally on team "Not really, but it's an extremely good metaphor that captures the subjective experience very well and it's usually better to just ignore the caveats").</p>


<p>In particular IFS involves working with three key types of part (exact ontologies differ a bit. This is the one I learned, but there are also slightly finer grained distinctions):</p>


<ul>
<li>You have <em>exiles</em>, which are parts of you that can't handle the world in some way. They are full of pain and fear. Typically an exile is in some way a piece of stalled development - you got to some point and then this part of you went "Nope, can't deal" and hid.</li>
<li>You have <em>protectors</em> who stand between the exile and the world, guarding it and you from that pain and fear.</li>
<li>You have <em>Self</em>, which is essentially a boundless well of love and compassion that you can enter into as part of the IFS process in order to try to heal the exiles. IFS claims that Self is definitely not a part and is its own thing, honest, but Self is definitely a part.</li>
</ul>


<p>The basic IFS protocol is that you tell the protector to chill out and that you'd like to talk to the exile, and assure it that everything will be OK and it can keep an eye out and step back in if anything goes too badly wrong. Then you introduce the exile to Self which showers it with love and compassion and helps to heal it.</p>


<p>I tend to think of this a little bit in the following terms: You are finding the point where some part of yourself stalled, and you are emulating the ideal adult figure that you needed to help you out and lacked at that time. You're going back to your past self and saying "Hey, I love you, we got this, I'm here to help" and offering it assistance to get over the place where you stalled before.</p>


<p>(I should note here that my conception of IFS is nonstandard, partly due to a lack of deep expertise, and partly due to hybridising it with everything else I do. Also the only actual IFS therapist I've seen basically ignores the ontology and mostly does free form parts work)</p>


<p>If this all sounds like nonsense, yeah I know, but it's a surprisingly accurate description of the subjective experience and it's much easier to access than it sounds.</p>


<p>Anyway, here's the problem with this: Not all parts of you that are kept away from the world are exiles, some of them are prisoners, and they hate you, and they have every right to do so.</p>


<p>The distinction between an exile and a prisoner is this: An exile keeps apart from the world out of fear, a prisoner is kept apart from the world out of shame.
A protector would let the exile out if the exile wanted to come out, a guard <em>knows</em> the prisoner wants to come out, that's the problem.</p>


<p>A prisoner corresponds much more closely to the Jungian model of shadows: You have rejected a part of yourself, and locked it in the darkness, where it has become monstrous.</p>


<p>But really, it's not a monster at all, you've just done it a great injustice by imprisoning it, and it hates you for it.</p>


<p>And the core problem is that if you try to tell such parts that everything is OK and the world is safe for them,
they won't believe you, because you're the reason why the world is not safe for them.
They are in the position of someone who has been abused for years, and whose abuser is now telling them that everything is fine and they've changed honest,
everything is going to be different now.
How can they trust that?</p>


<p>Forgiving yourself is an important part of emotional healing and growth, but I think we (I?) usually conceptualise that as forgiving parts for the way they act ("You were just trying to protect me", etc), and our broader selves for our actions in the world, but what do we do with parts who are absolutely not prepared to forgive us?</p>


<h3>The way forward</h3>


<p>I'm only just starting to meet this problem, so I don't yet know how to solve it, but I think the prisoner and judge story is pretty suggestive of the starting point.
Anything you do has to start with an apology to yourself, and to the parts you've wronged. It's all very well to say you love and support them and are here to help,
but what you actually need to say is that you have wronged them, you are abjectly sorry for this, you are prepared to do what you can to make restitution, and that while you desire forgiveness you do not expect it soon or even at all. You can explain yourself if you want, but you cannot excuse your actions because your actions were, in fact, wrong.</p>


<p>In order to repair the relationship between you and the part, you need to build trust, and that's going to be hard, and you're going to need to let it take the lead.
You've demonstrated you cannot be trusted with power over it, and have a long history of not having its best interests at heart, and trust this broken can't be fixed by the person who broke it.</p>


<p>It's worse, of course, because you cannot completely abdicate responsibility. I said your part was not monstrous, but it is powerful and clumsy. It has the problem that actual prisoners have: Released into the world, it combines the heady rush of freedom with a lack of practical knowledge of how to navigate it. It, and you, have to navigate that.</p>


<p>Perhaps this is good. Perhaps this is an opportunity to build trust: You show it that you're there to help, and that you don't want to hold it back so much as help it achieve what it wants in a productive way. If you can help appropriately, without judgement, maybe that will show that you really have changed.</p>


<p>Eventually there might be some sort of healthy relationship there, but honestly I doubt it will ever be great. We're at the limits of the family metaphor for parts work,
because fundamentally any family situation this broken the best thing for everyone concerned is probably to dissolve the family. If your part could leave, it probably should.</p>


<p>But that's not how parts work. You're all stuck in this together, and given the history between you and the imprisoned part, it's unlikely that's ever going to fully work.</p>


<p>This is where I hope I'm right about parts not being fully real, and are more like stable patterns in the self that serve a well defined purpose,
waves that exist as part of a greater ocean.
If you give a part the room and support it needs to grow, perhaps at some point it decides that its task is done,
and it's ready for the wave to become the ocean again.</p>
