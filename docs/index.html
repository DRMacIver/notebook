<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2AVz40p">Perplexities of Consciousness</a> by Eric Schwitzgebel, page 125:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Look around a bit. Consider your visual experience as you do. Does it seem to have a center and a periphery, differing somehow in clarity, precision of shape and color, richness of detail? Yes? It seems that way to me too. Now, how <em>broad</em> is that field of clarity? Thirdty degees? More? Maybe you are looking at your desk, as I am. Does it seem that a fairly wide swath of the desk (a square foot?) presents itself clearly in experience at any one moment, with th shapes, colors, textures all sharply defined? Most people, when I ask them, dendorse something like that. They are, I think, mistaken.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is as part of a broader segment where he walks you through to realising just how small your field of clear vision actually is - it looks larger because your eyes are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade">saccading</a> all over the place because vision is actually an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-30-13:17.html">active process of looking</a> rather than a passive receipt of a visual field, so you are implicitly using that to fill out a wider visual field.</p>


<p>This is an example of one of the interesting things I've been coming to terms with over the last year or so of personal development: the fact that people can be and usually are completely and totally wrong about their internal and embodied experiences.</p>


<p>(As per usual when I say "people are completely and totally wrong" I want to emphasise that "people" here <em>very</em> much includes me. I've been learning this in large part through becoming fractionally less wrong about my internal experience)</p>


<p>I think one way to understand why we are like this is to think about C++.</p>


<p>(Yes, sorry, this is going to be another <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">slightly strained analogy for how brains are like software development</a>)</p>


<p>C++ is an utter monster of a language. It's large, it doesn't so much have sharp edges as is made from razors glued together, and it's built out of a gradual accretion of features that made sense at the time. The <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/68564.html">latest C++ standard</a> is 1605 pages long and also costs CHF198. Nobody actually knows the whole thing because every time someone understands C++ in its completion their brain is eaten by creatures from the outer dark. Fortunately this has only ever happened twice.</p>


<p>And yet people write C++. A lot.</p>


<p>How? Well they don't even try to write using the whole thing. They pick a subset of it that is sufficient for their use case and is more or less manageable, and they use that. Often they don't even fully understand the bits they use, because they've got weird edge cases that basically never crop up - or don't crop up at all unless you use features of the language outside of your subset.</p>


<p>Typically when people write C++ together they mostly agree on which subset to use - different people will have different preferences, but they'll largely agree because when you use something your coworkers particularly dislike (even if it's only in "your" code) they'll start having angry words with you.</p>


<p>How are these subsets chosen? Generally, conservatively. You write the bits you know. If someone tells you about something neat you might start using it. If something bad happens, you learn to avoid that feature in future (often without really being able to explain why or what happened). Sometimes standards are codified, but more often than not there is a rough and messy process of negotiation and fumbling around that leads to something approximating a reasonable dialect.</p>


<p>Thus, even though every C++ project potentially has the entire vastness of C++ available to them, in practice they spend the entire time in a tiny subset of it that they are able to cope with.</p>


<p>One thing this subsetting enables people to do is have <em>completely wrong</em> mental models of how things work that just happen to work on the subset in question. Often this is a very good thing because these models are so much simpler than the reality. Thus as well as not requiring you to understand things you don't use, subsetting helps you understand how to work with the bits that you do use by letting you ignore complexity.</p>


<p>Until it doesn't. The nice thing about these simplified but wrong mental models is that they're simple. The bad thing about them is that they're wrong. And then you run into an edge case and discover that the reality is so much weirder and more broken than you had assumed it to be.</p>


<p>Anyway, to cut a long analogy short, life is like this: The actual range of human experience and capability is much more weird and complicated (and, occasionally, richer and more powerful) than we typically experience it as, because trying to keep on top of that all the time is impossible. Instead we've each learned a little subset of the possibilities available to us that mostly works, and we develop these simplified and wrong models of how it works (such as treating our field of clear vision as a simple static view of our visual field rather than a dynamically updated approximation to it). These work great, until some jerk does philosophy to us and forces us to confront how complicated being a human being actually is.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Books are never finished, only abandoned</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-24</dd>
</dl>


<p>I've been noticing something recently: I've really started to resent lending books.</p>


<p>If a book is good enough to be worth lending, it's probably good enough that I want to keep referring back to it, and lending out a book means that for an unknown amount of time I will lack access to the book.</p>


<p>I've turned this feeling into a feature rather than a bug: It helps me find out which books I really value. If I lend a book out to someone and find I'm missing it, I buy myself a new copy and now I have a loaner copy as well.</p>


<p>(This of course doesn't work that well with expensive or hard to find books. I'm going to solve that problem by not lending those books)</p>


<p>Part of why this has been interesting to observe is that it highlights some of my changing relationship with books. Instead of books being a thing to complete, <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1266093917885337600">books are part of an ongoing process of reading</a>. The fact that I have read a book cover to cover doesn't necessarily take it out of that process. If nothing else, it just moves it into fodder for the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html">writing practice</a>.</p>


<p><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-09-10:23.html">A Book is a Tool for Thinking With</a>, so a book is only done when you no longer need that tool.</p>


<p>This might be because:</p>


<ol>
<li>You've acquired a strictly better tool.</li>
<li>You've internalised the book so well that you no longer need the tool.</li>
<li>You're no longer interested in having the thoughts it enables.</li>
</ol>


<p>In my experience this is roughly in increasing order of likelihood for books that were worth reading in the first place: You can hit the point of diminishing returns, but you rarely hit the point where you <em>can't</em> get anything out of a book, you just get to the point where you're no longer interested in doing so.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Speech and Writing</p>

</dl>


<p>(Heads up: I'm really struggling at the moment so I'm leaning extra hard on the fact that it's better to phone it in than not write)</p>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2LZMM4W">The Art of Not Being Governed</a> by James C. Scott, page 389:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>This is why Socrates believed that writing out his teachings effectively destroyed their meaning and value, whil it is just this instability, spontaneity, and improvisation of speech that made Plato so suspicious of drama and poetry.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is an endnote to page 230:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>From the moment a spoken text (a particular performance) is frozen in writing as preserved speech, it effaces most of the particularity of its origin - cadence, tone, pauses, accompanying music and dance, audience reaction, bodily and facial expression - any one of which might be essential to its original meaning.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This connects up to a couple things for me:</p>


<ul>
<li>Ursula Le Guin's "Telling is Listening" Which is well summarised by <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/10/21/telling-is-listening-ursula-k-le-guin-communication/">Brain Pickings</a></li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3emI4ud">Conflict is not Abuse</a>, which claims that conflicts are generally better resolved in higher context higher bandwidth environments (ideally in person, if not in person on the phone, certainly not over text).</li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-14-10:26.html">My recent sadposting about friendships in the cloud</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I'm a big fan of writing. This should not be a surprise to you. But there does seem to be something fundamentally different about speech that is lost in writing (and vice versa), and I'm definitely feeling its lack at the moment.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Non-Experts and Status in Expert Communities</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>

</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew">Talking About Machines</a> by Julian Orr, page 93:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>the use of the machines causes some ambivalence for the technicians. On the one hand, the only reason for having the machines is to use them, and the only reason for having technicians is that when machines are used they break. [...] On th eother hand, while technicians have a certain amount of their identity invested in the machines, the customers do not, yet the customers have the machines. Figuratively speaking, the technicians machines are in the hands of the heathen.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this is a common problem for people with technical expertise: Technical expertise is useful more or less only to the degree that it serves the non-expert, but <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-08-08:53.html">the non-expert stubbornly refuses to understand your expertise</a>.</p>


<p>It is very easy to go from this to holding the non-expert in contempt: Looking down on the non-experts precisely because they are non-experts, despite the fact that your community of expertise is supported by the needs of the non-experts it serves.</p>


<p>I think this problem is particularly exacerbated by the fact that any area of expertise is a community of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">nerds</a> whose social bonds and status are centered on their area of expertise.
Status in an expert community is primarily (though not exclusively) defined by how good you are at the subject.</p>


<p>From this perspective, a lack of expertise <em>is</em> low status. Non-experts, more or less by definition, are not experts and thus do not do well by these stats metrics. They are outgroup.</p>


<p>This necessarily creates a deeply ambivalent relationship between the expert community and the non-experts on which they are dependent: The people who are essential for their survival are also people who they have to adopt a different mindset from their usual one in order to properly respect.</p>


<p>I think this feeds in to why usability work and user experience is so often considered low status within these communities: They force us to confront the congitive dissonance intrinsic in our dependence on those who are not one of us.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2TC15R4">Against the Grain</a> by James C. Scott, page 213:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Episodes of collapse are frequently succeeded by what comes to be known as a "dark age." Just as the meaning of collapse merits close and critical inspection, so the term "dark age" needs to be queried: "dark" for whom and in what respects? Dark ages are just as ubiquitous as storied dynastic highpoints of consolidation. The term is often a form of propaganda by which a centralizing dynasty contrasts its achievement with what it casts as the disunity and decentralization that preceded it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>There's a saying that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it (actually the original quote is probably "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it" - and yes I find it very funny that this quote is not properly remembered).</p>


<p>The problem with learning from history is that the very notion of "history" is a bait and switch.
We use it to mean two things:</p>


<ol>
<li>Stuff that happened in the past.</li>
<li>The study of said stuff.</li>
</ol>


<p>But the study of the past heavily over-represents the sort of thing that leaves stable records. We have access to the physical libraries of the past (except the bits that got burned) but not to the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-16-07:43.html">ghost library</a>.</p>


<p>Actual historians do, by and large, understand this of course, but to some extent there's only so much you can do: There's just vastly more information to study that represents what people with power wrote down. The best we can do with the rest is to read between the lines of that and infer what we can from archaeological remnants.</p>


<p>If you're not a historian, you may never really have learned how to engage properly with history (I certainly didn't), and so may have bought into a lot of historical propaganda.</p>


<p>People are, I think, aware of the problem of modern propaganda - we <em>know</em> journalists are mostly somewhere between highly selective and outright lying to us - but we tend to forget that historical records are mostly written by people who were doing the same at the time.</p>


<p>This is before you even get into the problem of modern propaganda efforts which are actively selecting from history to paint a particular narrative - a lot of the people telling us about the glories of the British Empire, for example, know full well how bad it was, they just don't want us to know that.</p>
