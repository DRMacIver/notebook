<p class="subtitle">Politics as long periods of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror</p>

<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2yvyoOw">Democracy in Small Groups</a> by John Gastil, page 145:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Consensus and democracy didn't always work to the satisfaction of the faculty and students at the Meeting School. Even as students obtained ever-greater power, they remaind reluctant to deal with many important issues.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think an under-appreciated constraint on the running of human civilisation is just how incredibly boring well-functioning politics is. (2020 politics is of course, sadly, not boring).</p>


<p>Worse, it manages to be simultaneously:</p>


<ul>
<li>Incredibly Boring</li>
<li>Extremely detailed</li>
<li>Highly Stressful</li>
<li>Utterly Vital</li>
</ul>


<p>I feel like this is a combination of factors that a democratic process is almost uniquely poorly suited for, which is I guess why we end up delegating so much of the running of a country to its civil service.</p>


<p>But there end up being all sorts of things which have these properties and you <em>can't</em> delegate to a civil service, because they require actual policy decisions, and I feel like we don't really have a good handle on how those work (or, at least <em>I</em> don't have a good handle on how those work. Is there some sort of ethnographic study of the UK parliament I could read?).</p>


<p>The worst combination seems to happen when a decision <em>requires</em> an understanding of all these boring details, but people who are not willing to believe that have democratic oversight over the decision anyway.
This is basically how you end up with Brexit.</p>


<p>On the other hand, I know enough about how the sausage is made that I wouldn't want a country run entirely by the civil service either (I admit I might still prefer this to the current lot). Experts are, ultimately, still people, and those people <em>do</em> in some way need to be aligned with the wishes of the populace, at least to the degree that those wishes are reality-based and not actively murderous.</p>


<p>(OK, maybe I <em>don't</em> want much democracy in the UK, as we seem to be pretty bad at both halves of that)</p>


<p>I don't have any sort of solution here. I often describe the problem of how to coordinate large groups of people whose interests are only weakly mutually aligned as the fundamental problem of civilisation, so it's not surprising that I'm not going to solve it in a dashed off notebook post, but I do feel like managing this boredom aspect is more important than I had previously realised.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, currently we manage the boredom of politics by getting increasingly frustrated with it and, as a result, eventually deciding to make politics exciting, and that doesn't go so well. </p>

<p class="subtitle">Inclusivity and Onboarding</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-29</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYeYew">Talking About Machines</a> by Julian Orr, page 70:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The conversation of a closely cooperating group can be quite cryptic when the members are sharing information about work; they are considering a well-defined field which can be discussed with considerable economy, verging on code.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>A thing I have been thinking about a lot recently is the trade off between making a community accessible and the community being able to serve the needs of its core members.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/being-deep-in-an-abstraction-stack">Being Deep in an Abstraction Stack</a> I talk about how you need a community of people who share your abstraction stack and there is really no substitute for this no matter how much we want one.</p>


<p>But unfortunately by creating such a community there is a certain amount of inherent gatekeeping: It is a community for people who have that abstraction stack, therefore if you do not have that abstraction stack you cannot participate in the community as a full member. I don't necessarily mean this as a moral judgement - sometimes gateekeeping is good - but there is nevertheless a certain amount of elitism implicit in the existence of such communities. In order to talk about our <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/maintaining-niche-interests">niche interests</a> we <em>need</em> this cryptic shared language, and attempts to make the group more inclusive by avoiding that will also make it worse for us.</p>


<p>I don't really have an answer to that other than "deal with it". "I need other people to talk about my interests with" is a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-15-09:33.html">nice problem to have</a>, but it's still a need and it's one that it is reasonable to satisfy, and creating slightly exclusionary communities is pretty much the only way to solve that problem..</p>


<p>Part of why I've been thinking about this is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3DkPGuAZiGbeNYlwje6jTlFxz9peIGnjSuZTwF4NGM/edit">Weird CS Theory Discord</a>. The opening paragraph includes the sentence:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>You don’t have to “be” a computer scientist, or even know much computer science, to be here, but if you’re not interested in computer science you probably won’t enjoy the space.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This hopefully makes it clear that we're not looking to gatekeep (I originally typoed that as "gategeek" which, well, valid) based on formal qualifications, but nevertheless there is a reasonably high bar to participating in the space. People are welcome to join, and they're welcome to learn to become full participants through their experience in the space, but that is there.</p>


<p>But, at the same time, we're a tiny free community that I created to serve my particular need for more chatter about weird CS theory. We're absolutely not a computer science institution. We cannot invest a tonne of effort in onboarding people, the best we can possibly hope to do is to be patient and welcoming to people who are still in the process of onboarding themselves.</p>


<p>One problem that occurs, and is important to avoid, is when this lack of inclusitivity becomes considered a feature rather than an unfortunate trade off. The specialised language becomes not a useful shorthand but a shibboleth.
I have tried to head that off by making it clear that asking us to explain ourselves is always valid:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[You are encouraged to] Ask questions. (“Can you explain that?” is always fine, though answering “No” is fine too)</p>
</blockquote>


<p>We have a specific norm that is designed to give people the space to indicate that they need help understanding something, but also a specific norm that we should not exhaust ourselves trying to bring people in.
If people want to bring themselves in, the door is open, but we can only help so much.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, this too is exclusionary: Many people don't have the time or resources to do that work themselves.
I feel bad about this, but ultimately the world is still a better place for the community, and there is only so much I can do about it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Seeing Your Working</p>


<dl class="metadata">

<dd class="post-date">2020-07-28</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2ZBIVTz">Style: Towards Clarity and Grace</a> by Joseph M. Williams, page 129:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>When someone is thoroughly at home in thinking through a problem, she can suppress in her prose the metadiscourse that records her thinking, allowing little or no of the intellectual process to reach the surface of her prose, or at least to remain the final draft.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Coincidentally, <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/writing-to-understand">today's newsletter is about the use of writing to understand rather than communicate</a>. Using writing specifically as a place where all your thinking goes on the page, and is thereby improved.</p>


<p>This reminds me of a complaint I often have: It's essentially impossible to learn to do mathematics by reading research level mathematics, because research level mathematics is performance of this form. A proof as presented is almost <em>never</em> a proof as discovered, because the authors have spent a great deal of time refining, generalising, and making the process more elegant. Additionally, it often contains little to no trace of the process that lead to that discovery, and is presented in an entirely different order from that which lead to the underlying insights.</p>


<p>It occurs to me that I would really enjoy reading a book that was just ethnographic studies and interviews of academics, where they talk about the process that lead to some great papers. Ideally these would be by embedded ethnographers who had spent some time observing the academics' actual research process, to try to offset the tendency to historical revisionism that we're all prone to.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Thinking Outside Your Head</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-27</dd>
</dl>


<p>As per <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-26-10:40.html">notes on reduced output</a> I'm trying to do more book post prompts. Right now I think this will be <em>very</em> rough and ready stuff where I'm just gathering together some related thoughts.</p>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/2LZNHSF">Behind Human Error</a> by Woods et al., page 173:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>flexibility tends to create and proliferate modes of operation which create new cognitive demands on practitioners. Practitioners must know more - both about how the system works in each different mode and about how to manage the new set of options in different operational contexts.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Long ago I wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-10-31-16:54.html">The No Genies Conjecture</a>, in which I proposed that all systems have at most two of the following properties:</p>


<ul>
<li>Powerful</li>
<li>Flexible</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
</ul>


<p>This prompted a good conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisamaphone/status/1252591089900572673">Chris Martens</a> about what "easy to use" meant, in that most experts presumably find their tools easy to use.
I think this is a good example of why that is not the case: As flexibility goes up, the amount of state that the expert has to manage in their head will usually exceed the capacity of their week fleshy game.</p>


<p>This is also the limitation of what I suggested in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-10-16:52.html">learning to use the system</a>, where I talked about how forming mental models is critical to using a system effectively.
In response to this pozorvlak pointed out how one of the features of good UI is to enable the formation of mental models.</p>


<p>In particular I thought <a href="https://twitter.com/pozorvlak/status/1282994011440021505">this point was particularly good</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>good UIs foster a good mental model of the system, <em>split over the mind of the user and the information available in the world</em>.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The problem is that this split is rarely well facilitated, especially in systems designed for experts, and this gets only worse as the flexibility of the system grows.</p>


<p>One of the big problems that comes up a lot in "Behind Human Error" is the problem of <em>modality</em>. Modal systems are ones where you need different mental models for different states of the system. People commit mode errors when they use a mental model for a different mode.</p>


<p>This, I think, points to one of the difficulties of externalising parts of your mental model: what you're externalising it as is, itself, something you need a model for.</p>


<p>I don't know what to do about this, but evidence suggests neither do the people who work on such systems unfortunately.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Notes on Reduced Output</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-07-26</dd>
</dl>


<p>You've probably noticed that, despite <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-08-10:11.html">my advocacy for daily writing</a> I've stopped writing here daily.</p>


<p>I think there are a couple of things going on.</p>


<p>The first is, as noted in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-16-09:22.html">habit overload</a> I've got just a bit too much going on habit-wise at the moment, and the daily notebook post has been crowded out a bit.</p>


<p>The second is, a lot of the utility of the notebook has been supplanted for me by other things.
This notebook is a place where I process thoughts and explain things I want to explain, but the former has been taken over by morning pages, and the latter has been taken over by the newsletter.</p>


<p>As a result, the notebook is left a bit vestigial. It's not clear what it's purpose is, and it's not quite clear where it fits into everything else in my habit schedule.</p>


<p>This is a shame, because I like the notebook and I'd quite like to stick with it,
so I think for the next week I'm going to double down on it as follows:</p>


<ol>
<li>I'm going to write the notebook post immediately after lunch.</li>
<li>I'm going to use a book prompt every day regardless of whether I feel like writing something else.</li>
</ol>


<p>This should hopefully help it find a better place in my schedule and use cases.</p>
