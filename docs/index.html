<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/36FzofT">Where Good Ideas Come From</a> by Steven Johnson, page 242:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>As Lawrence Lessig has so persuasively argued over the years, there is nothing "natural" about the artificial scarcity of intellectual property law. [...] Ideas are intrinsically copyable in the way that food and fuel are not. You have to build dams to keep ideas from flowing.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This is in the context of Johnson talking about what he calls the <em>fourth quadrant</em> - ideas generated by networks of people operating outside of market incentives. The fourth quadrant is in fact a great source of innovation, and a large part of that is this relative lack of intellectual property dams. If someone comes up with a great idea and isn't interested in making money off it, they're usually delighted if you copy them. Good etiquette requires that you <em>credit</em> them, and ideally (in the spirit of open source) if you make any improvements to the idea you pay it back by telling them or others about it, so as long as everyone behaves like a vaguely good citizen sharing ideas that you don't intend to monetize is a net positive for everyone.</p>


<p>One difficulty is when ideas escape the network and into the market - if you share your idea and someone goes "that's a great idea, I'm going to make money off it", that's less good. Firstly, you feel exploited (in many cases this will be literally <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2017/09/the-question-of-cultural-appropriation">cultural exploitation</a>) and secondly now there's an entity who likely has more money (and thus power) than you who is liable to claim ownership of the idea and/or make demands of you, and because you gave the idea away for free you have little leverage.</p>


<p>If I sound bitter, this is of course because we run into this problem in FOSS a lot.</p>


<p>But there's a nice example where this doesn't really come up that much, which is <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/the-missing-social-technology-sector/">social technology</a>. You do get people "selling" social technology through writing books and doing consulting or training courses, but even there it tends to be pretty much part of the network rather than the market, with members of the network also making money off it.</p>


<p>A lot more people are developing social technology, and more general technologies in the form of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html">the techniques of being human</a>. In the last year or so I've been hanging out with the group who I tend to refer to as "feelings Twitter" - a very loosely aligned group of people who basically do a lot of weird therapy and talk about their feelings and the tools they've used to explore them. This is very much an example of fourth quadrant innovation, with people mixing and matching, generating new techniques, boosting ideas that have worked well for them.</p>


<p>So far this all seems to work out pretty well, and I think a large part of that is that even though you can make money off this sort of thing very few of us are trying to do so (I suppose I kinda am trying to make money off it, in that the newsletter is paid, but I'm pretty far from being there). Being better humans is <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/what-do-you-do">our work but not our job</a>.</p>


<p>At the moment I don't see much risk of us falling into the FOSS trap of having to support companies who are using our stuff for free (providing free therapy in your DMs is a lot more likely, but I think quite a different problem and not necessarily a problem at all), and if a company uses our ideas that's generally going to be somewhere between neutral an positive for us (it might be a bit annoying if and when they butcher them).</p>


<p>And, to go back to the original quote, a lot of that is because you can't patent social technologies. Lets keep it that way.</p>

<p class="subtitle">I'm not actually that curious</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-28</dd>
</dl>


<p>Small personal note, but I've noticed a number of people have a particular misconception of me,
and thought I'd clear it up.</p>


<p>You know how I read insatiably, driven by pure curiosity, and know a huge amount of different things just because I wanted to know them?</p>


<p>Yeah, I don't do that.</p>


<p>At least, I don't do that often. It's a thing I do <em>sometimes</em>, but an idle scan of my bookshelves suggests that no more than about one book in twenty is something I've read out of pure interest. Generally speaking if I'm reading something nonfiction it's because I expect it will actually improve my life in some material way.</p>


<p>I'd like this to not be the case: It would be wonderful if I could just read things because I thought they were interesting, but I actually find it very difficult to be interested in knowledge that I can't use in some way to solve practical problems. I suspect that will improve as the ongoing project to improve my emotional landscape progresses, but I'm very much not there yet.</p>


<p>Don't get me wrong, a lot of the books I read are super interesting in their own right, and I do appreciate that aspect of them. I also don't do well at reading boring books. But I don't <em>select</em> books because they're interesting, I select books because they'll help me with something. The emotion that most commonly drives me to read a book isn't curiosity, it's distress: Something is bad, and my stress response is to understand more about the subject matter so I can make it better, so I read a book about it.</p>


<p>It's not <em>always</em> distress. Sometimes it's because I'm annoyed that something doesn't make sense. Sometimes it's a simple desire for improvement, or some really concrete problem to solve. Sometimes it's just a general background faith that even if I don't have a specific problem I'm trying to solve then the book will be good for <em>something</em>.</p>


<p>This might seem odd given my reading material ("David, what are you reading?" "I'm reading a Christian theology book about how giving yourself over to Christ will solve capitalism." "Of course you are.") but what you have to bear in mind is that I am a deeply unreasonable person with a very idiosyncratic approach to knowledge.</p>


<p>If you read my <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-09-11:26.html">notes towards a manifesto</a>, a lot of what I'm working on is "general humaning skills". What field do you need to read in in order to figure out how to do humaning better? Basically all of them I'm afraid.</p>


<p>When I say <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html">All knowledge is connected</a> I think most people nod sagely and agree that this is true in principle, and you do get people reading out their field a bit (e.g. Software developers reading architecture books is a thing, though mostly because books about software development are mostly terrible, and every field has a subculture of people telling you that you need to read <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1270346474027712513">Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a> to truly understand it). But I don't think, by and large, people fully embrace it as a praxis, mostly because it's really hard and time consuming.</p>


<p>I have three advantages here:</p>


<ol>
<li>I take the idea seriously and am willing to put in the work.</li>
<li>I don't find it that hard. I'm good at reading books, I'm good at connecting up knowledge, and I generally prefer hitting practical problems with huge theory hammers.</li>
<li>I have a relatively large amount of time to devote to the problem, especially <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/why-am-i-not-working-on-my-phd">on days when I'm failing to work on my PhD</a>.</li>
</ol>


<p>The result is that yes I just really <em>am</em> the sort of person who goes "Community drama seems like a really hard problem. Why don't I read <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2019-05-09-15:33.html">a text on Talmudic law</a> so I can understand it better?" and have a project to learn phenomenology so I can improve my own subjective emotional experience.</p>


<p>Does this work?</p>


<p>Honestly, yes. I cannot say that I recommend it to everyone, or even to most people, but I've found it extraordinarily helpful. It's not sufficient in its own right, but I've been taking this seriously for a few years and really kicked it into high gear this year with the addition of the writing practice to properly integrate this knowledge, and I've seen huge improvements in my life enabled by it.</p>


<p>I expect I'll keep reading like this for at least another couple of years - with any luck I'll gradually include a higher fraction of pure interest reading as time goes on, but I doubt I'm at any risk of solving all my problems any time soon.</p>


<p>I can't read everything relevant to my problems of course. I'm not trying to. What I'm trying to do is cultivate a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-13-11:35.html">domus</a> that gives me a sufficient wealth of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-27-11:07.html">ideas to get me unstuck</a> on making progress with the problems I have.</p>


<p>(A domus is a concept I got from reading about the early history of civilisation and the role of grain cultivation - James C. Scott is an author I tend to just read because I assume I'll get something useful out of it even if I don't know what going in. Haven't been wrong yet)</p>


<p>When I encounter a limitation, I read new material to overcome it. Because the category of problems I am trying to solve is, in the limit, <em>all of human endeavour</em>, there's no shortage of limitations. The result is a constant switching around of what I'm working on based on what I can currently make progress on, and reading whatever seems most currently accessible and relevant to the bits I'm actively stuck on. This tends to cause me to bounce around a lot between different fields, because once I've read a book (or a couple books sometimes) about a subject I need a while to let it bed in and try applying it and integrating it before I'm ready to read more in that area.</p>


<p>From the outside this process <em>does</em> looks a lot like curiosity, but as a David expert I'm here to tell you that this isn't cute, and Davids only behave this way when they're under stress.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Ideas Get You Unstuck</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-27</dd>
</dl>


<p>From <a href="https://amzn.to/3d13X1P">the wave in the mind</a> by Ursula K. Le Guin, page 279:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I started the book five times, it got nowhere. I had to stop.</p>
<p>I had to sit patiently and say nothing, at the same time every day, while the fox looked at me from the corner of its eye, and slowly let me get a little bit closer.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>On the next page, 280:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Critics talk as if stories were all idea, but intellect does not make story and more than ideology makes art. The story had to make itself, find its center, find its voice, Sutty's voice. Then, because I was waiting for it, it could give itself to me.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Le Guin is talking about the process of story formation, and how it comes through an accretion of pieces that cause it to fit together. However I find it strange that she uses the fact that she had to sit and wait for Sutty's voice as evidence that a story is <em>not</em> just composed about ideas, because Sutty's voice is, itself, an idea, and it came to her as most ideas inevitably do - at first slowly, and then suddenly.</p>


<p>She's right of course that a story is not just composed of ideas. As with basically everything, a story is mostly composed of work, and skill in doing that work. Ideas serve the purpose they serve everywhere: They're there to get you unstuck.</p>


<p>Generally, if you're not currently stuck, you need to either do the work. If you're not good enough to do the work, you need to learn to be better at it (you can, of course, then get stuck in the learning process). That's where an idea helps you out: It <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">gives you something to try</a>. An idea is a thought that points to a way to improve the situation.</p>


<p>The two main ways of getting stuck are:</p>


<ol>
<li>You don't know what to do.</li>
<li>You know what to do but you don't know how to do it.</li>
</ol>


<p>I think Le Guin is only using "idea" to refer to things that solve the first kind of getting stuck, but they're if anything more important for the second type. Ideas of the first kind are cheap: There are a million things to do at any moment, ideas about what to do are cheap, and if you're struggling to figure those out it's probably an emotional problem (e.g. "everything feels pointless and I hate myself" or "I'm not good enough to do any of these") rather than actual difficulty generating ideas.</p>


<p>The second version though is still idea generation, but it's idea generation on hard mode, because you can't just pick an idea and see where it leads the ideas you generate actually have to have a decent chance of working, for some very specific notion of work. These are the times that force you to actually develop the skill of idea generation,
and the first part of that skill is that process that Le Guin describes of <a href="https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/09/20/the-state-of-being-stuck/">getting stuck and sitting with it</a>.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Find a forking path</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-26</dd>
</dl>


<p>Suppose you come to a fork in the road. You know that one arm of the fork goes to an amazing destination. The other arm goes to a mildly disappointing destination - nothing too terrible, but the knowledge that you've ended up there instead of the great destination will make you sad. There's nothing to distinguish which path is which.
What do you do?</p>


<p>Well, based on my keen and insightful observation of human behaviour, I can tell you what you probably do:
you sit down in the road and cry about it, and eventually waste away and die never having taken either path.</p>


<p>This is a bad plan. Just <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">flip a coin and use that outcome</a>. If you want to spend a little while looking for clues first, you can do that, but picking either path is ging to be better than being paralysed for choice.</p>


<p>Even if you end up in the destination of mild disappointment, you're still better off than before. You've <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">learned something</a>. Maybe that knowledge will help you find the great destination? If nothing else you could walk back up the path and go the other way.</p>


<p>Coming to forks like this is generally a really good thing, because:</p>


<ol>
<li>Both outcomes are a strict improvement on the status quo.</li>
<li>One of the outcomes is really really good, easily justifying the effort of taking the fork.</li>
</ol>


<p>But because we are unable to deal with the fear of making a bad choice, we end up with decision paralysis instead, the very idea of taking the fork becomes scary, and we either sit down and cry or (more often) pretend the fork doesn't exist and back away slowly down the path.</p>


<p>As a result, forks like these are <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-05-06-09:51.html">fnords</a> - things that we learn not to see, because seeing them makes us feel obliged to deal with them, so every time we run into them we flinch away and pretend not to have noticed.</p>


<p>A neat consequence of this is that we are probably <em>surrounded</em> by high value opportunities that we are ignoring. If you start looking for this pattern, you'll probably find all sorts of examples.</p>


<p>Here are a couple I'm aware of:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html">Trusting people (slightly) more than you're sure they're worthy of</a> - either you learn more about how trustworthy they are, or you improve the level of trust between you.</li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-06-03-09:56.html">Approach emotions with the intention to act on them if they're accurate</a> - either you improve your emotional response or you improve your understanding of the situation.</li>
<li><a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-05-11:27.html">Entertain bad ideas</a> - either you learn more about the problem or you figure out how to make the idea good.</li>
</ul>


<p>Another one I'm currently entertaining but haven't really committed to: I think it might be possible to break habits that you don't like by trying to actively enjoy that habit. If you have a compulsive snacking problem, say "OK. It's completely fine for me to snack, but I've got to really revel in it. I'm going to <em>enjoy</em> this food dammit". If you have a compulsive urge to check Twitter, aim to have fun on Twitter - go into a deep nerd dive on someone's timeline, do something interesting other than just scrolling.</p>


<p>If this works (I'm not sure the fork is viable, which is why I don't know if it will work yet), either you break the habit or you enjoy yourself more, and both of these are good things.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Trying out this thing called Hypothesis</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-06-25</dd>
</dl>


<p>Hey, you know that software called Hypothesis?</p>


<p>No, not <a href="https://hypothesis.works/">that one</a>, the one for <a href="https://hypothes.is/">web annotation</a>.</p>


<p>Anyway, <a href="https://twitter.com/nibrasibn/status/1275811352225906688">nibras was expressing an urge to comment inline on her friends' websites</a> and I pointed out that this was exactly what hypothesis is for.</p>


<p>Then it occurred to me that it <em>would</em> be nice to expose that sort of functionality directly on the notebook. It turns out you can embed hypothes.is directly into your site with an easy piece of javascript, so now I have. You should be able to add annotations to any of the notebook posts (it's not currently turned on for posts as they show up in the index, because I couldn't be bothered to figure out how).</p>


<p>You'll need an account on <a href="https://hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a> to make annotations, but you should be able to see any public annotations people make. The toolbar on the right will give you some options to control what you see.</p>


<p>To make an annotation just select some text, click "annotate" and write whatever you like there. It should hopefully all be fairly intuitive.</p>
