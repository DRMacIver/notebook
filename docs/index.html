<p class="subtitle">Rejection Sampling in Hypothesis</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-01-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>(This post assumes you know roughly how Hypothesis does test-case reduction and generation. See <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/details/ecoop-2020-papers/13/Test-Case-Reduction-via-Test-Case-Generation-Insights-From-the-Hypothesis-Reducer">our ECOOP paper</a> for a high level explanation)</p>


<p>Suppose you have some generator <code>base</code> and you want to sample from it conditionally.
In Hypotheis you can do this with <code>base.filter(condition)</code>.</p>


<p>Conceptually, this does <em>rejection sampling</em>, which works roughly like this:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Filtered</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">base</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">condition</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__base</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">base</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__condition</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">condition</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">do_draw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">while</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">attempt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">draw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__base</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__condition</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">):</span>
                <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">attempt</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That is, we're attempting to draw from the conditional distribution of values that come from <code>base</code> that satisfy <code>condition</code> and we do this by repeatedly drawing values from it until one satisfies the condition.</p>


<p>This has a couple of problems:</p>


<ol>
<li>The underlying choice sequence contains a lot of probably useless garbage - we made a bunch of choices in each iteration of the loop when drawing from the base (and possibly even when calling the condition! This is allowed), and these are probably all irrelevant.</li>
<li>These loops are potentially very long, especially if the condition is hard or impossible to satisfy.</li>
</ol>


<p>We adopt the following heuristic approach to deal with the second problem:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Filtered</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">do_draw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="n">attempt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">draw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__base</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__condition</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">):</span>
                <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">attempt</span>
        <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mark_invalid</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That is, we terminate all rejection sampling at three iterations - it may well be possible to proceed from there, but if so we have a chance at trying again at the next generation, and spending longer seems largely not worth it.</p>


<p>(Why three you ask? Well, let me ask you a better question: Why not three?)</p>


<p>(That is to say, no good reason. It's a fairly arbitrarily chosen number that seems to work OK)</p>


<p>The first problem we have a slightly more principled way to deal with: We want to be able to reduce the choice sequence by removing all the redundant draws.</p>


<p>(This is made <em>slightly</em> more complicated by the fact that the draws might not be redundant - Hypothesis generators are allowed to have side effects, such as inserting rows into a database, so it's possible for a filtered generator to do important work in the initial loops).</p>


<p>Assuming for the moment that <code>condition</code> does not make any choices (which it mostly won't, and we're not that fussed about producing worse results if it does) this is actually relatively easy:
The boundaries of the <code>draw</code> call are marked on the choice sequence, and the reducer can try deleting that region of the choice sequence. This allows it to delete the early iterations of the loop,
resulting in an effect where in a reduced choice sequence we just get implausibly lucky and always satisfy the condition first time.</p>


<p>We can, and do (although <a href="https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/pull/2757">it turns out this got silently broken at some point and I fixed it as a result of writing this blog post</a>), speed this up further by adding special boundary markers that indicate that the region is probably irrelevant.
This looks like the following:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Filtered</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">do_draw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">_</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start_example</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">FILTER_LABEL</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="n">attempt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">draw</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__base</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">__condition</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">):</span>
                <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stop_example</span><span class="p">()</span>
                <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">attempt</span>
            <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">stop_example</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">discard</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mark_invalid</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason this helps is that we can gather together all regions of the choice sequence that have been marked as discarded and attempt to delete them simultaneously.
This will, usually, work. In particular it allows us to make all filtered generators implausibly lucky simultaneously with one call.</p>


<p>This kind of annotation of the choice sequence with useful information about common patterns in generation is often quite helpful for Hypothesis's test-case reduction. I think a lot of it is not that necessary any more, but this distinction between used and discarded regions seems to help a great deal and often allows for some significant performance improvements during reduction.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Representing Steps in Test-Case Reduction</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>

</dl>


<p>In <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-01-01-11:22.html">my last post</a> on reducer design I included the following deletion algorithm:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greedy_deletion</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">attempt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[:</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:]</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_interesting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This iterates forward through a sequence and tries deleting each element of it in turn to see if it's still interesting.
It's a foundation for a lot of useful test-case reduction passes.</p>


<p>It's also in the wrong order. Really for most problems you probably want to write it as follows:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greedy_deletion</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="c1"># We're only calling this for the side effect of updating self.best_test_case</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_interesting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[:</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:])</span>
        <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">-=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reason for this order is that later elements often depend on early elements (e.g. if a variable declared earlier is used later),
so this often does less wasted work because it takes fewer passes to get to a fixed point - going forward, you need to rerun the entire pass to delete the earlier bits that have been enabled by the later bits.</p>


<p>One problem with either of these is that they can lead to long stalls, where there's a large undeletable region and you're slowly going through all of it.
This is particularly annoying because often if you'd made the test case much smaller before checking all of those bits it would be much faster to go through them,
because the interestingness test is faster on smaller test cases.</p>


<p>In order to avoid these stalls it might be better to write it like this:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greedy_deletion</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">indices</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">)))</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">indices</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">pop_random</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">indices</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="c1"># Might no longer be true because we've successfully reduced</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="c1"># We're only calling this for the side effect of updating self.best_test_case</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_interesting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[:</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:])</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This iterates over the test case in a random order, avoiding stalls as a result - if a fraction \(p\) of the test case is deletable this will only stall for around \(\frac{1}{p}\) steps, while either deterministic version can potentially stall for \(O(n)\) calls.</p>


<p>(this isn't a very good way of doing randomisation, and all of these are improved by <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/06/adaptive-delta-debugging/">adaptive delta debugging</a> of course, but we'll ignore that for now).</p>


<p>The problem of course is that all of these are basically the same algorithm with a lot of code duplication between them, and we would like to be able to flexibly swap between modes based on what's working.</p>


<p>Another related problem is that often we want to get an idea of how good a pass is before running it. If we were to e.g. run the random one for ten steps and see if it did anything before we decide whether to run the full thing, that would help a lot with the pass selection problem (how we know which reduction pass we should run right now).</p>


<p>This example also makes it seem easier than it is. Consider the following reduction pass:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">put_in_order</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">)):</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">j</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">9</span><span class="p">)):</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="p">]:</span>
                <span class="n">attempt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">)</span>
                <span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">j</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span>
                <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_interesting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This tries swapping all nearby out of order pairs in order to make the test case more sorted (which is a reduction lexicographically).
Here all the same considerations potentially apply, but there are two indices that vary instead of one.
The question of what order to try things in is also even more complicated, as potentially this one might need <em>many</em> passes to reach convergence (there are \(n!\) possible permutations of a sequence so I think this has the potential to take \(O(n!)\) calls to complete given an adversarial interestingness test).</p>


<p>All of this is problem set up as a preamble for telling you about how we solve the problem in Hypothesis, which is to consider a reduction pass as making a series of nondeterministic choices,
which it must exhaustively try all of before reduction is considered to have finished.
The API for making these choices looks as follows:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">DeadBranch</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ne">Exception</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="sd">"""Raised when a reduction pass is unable to continue from</span>
<span class="sd">    the current point."""</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Chooser</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="sd">"""A source of nondeterminism for use in reduction passes."""</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">choose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">values</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">condition</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="kc">True</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="sd">"""Returns a value ``x`` in ``values`` such that</span>
<span class="sd">        ``condition(x)`` is True, possibly raising ``DeadBranch``</span>
<span class="sd">        if there are no such values, or if it turns out we have</span>
<span class="sd">        already exhausted all remaining values. """</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The reduction passes above now look as follows:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greedy_deletion</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">chooser</span><span class="p">):</span>

<p>The reducer is now free to try these in any order it likes, without the reduction passes overspecifying it.</p>


<p>Currently we try two different orders in different contexts:</p>


<ol>
<li>Uniformly at random.</li>
<li>Iterating backwards in reverse lexicographic order.</li>
</ol>


<p>Switching between the two according some frankly fairly arbitrary internal heuristics that seem to work pretty well but are clearly suboptimal.</p>


<p>The thing that's worth noting however is the representation. You can see it in <a href="https://github.com/HypothesisWorks/hypothesis/blob/master/hypothesis-python/src/hypothesis/internal/conjecture/choicetree.py">the relevant Python file</a>, but the important features of it are basically:</p>


<ol>
<li>We maintain a rose tree, lazily built as we walk it, where each node has <code>len(values)</code> children, <code>values</code> being the collection of choices made at that point. Each node also maintains a count of how many "live" (that is, not fully explored) children it has.</li>
<li>When we complete running a pass step, we mark the final node as dead, decrement the count on its parent and if that is zero also mark it as dead and do the same with its parent etc.</li>
<li>Every time we successfully reduce the current target, we delete the tree and start over with a fresh one, but for deterministic iteration start from the same point in the tree (to the greatest degree possible)</li>
</ol>


<p>Essentially we are representing a step in a reduction pass as a sequence of integers representing nondeterministic choices,
and stopping when the full tree has been explored for the given shrink target.
As well as turning out to be quite a convenient representation, this is pleasingly similar to <a href="https://2020.ecoop.org/details/ecoop-2020-papers/13/Test-Case-Reduction-via-Test-Case-Generation-Insights-From-the-Hypothesis-Reducer">how Hypothesis represents test-case generation</a>.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Basic Reducer Design</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-01-01</dd>
</dl>


<p>There's a design of test-case reducer that I use and consider the natural way to do test-case reducers,
but seems to be mildly idiosyncratic to me (though most of the details of it are found in other test-case reducers),
which is basically this:</p>


<ol>
<li>Test cases are given some total order, the <em>reduction order</em>, and the goal of test-case reduction is to (ideally) find the minimal interesting test case in that reduction order.</li>
<li>Test-case reduction is managed by a stateful object that automatically simplifies the book keeping of doing that.</li>
<li>Test-case reduction consists of a sequence of passes that are run until none of them lowers the current most interesting test case.</li>
</ol>


<p>(the fact that there is a total reduction order plus some of the book keeping are the bits that seem not totally standard)</p>


<p>The reduction order lets us keep track of the current best test case and this significantly simplifies keeping track of the progress of the reducer.
This can all be encapsulated as the following Python code:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Reducer</span><span class="p">:</span>

<p>A reduction pass in this framework looks something like the following (this is a greedy algorithm for deleting elements from a list or other sequence, like delta debugging without the delta step):</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">greedy_deletion</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>

        <span class="n">attempt</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[:</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_test_case</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:]</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">is_interesting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">attempt</span><span class="p">):</span>
            <span class="n">i</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This design has a lot of flexibility to it. For example, it makes arbitrary reduction passes into an anytime algorithm, because you always know the current best test case,
and so you can design it work with arbitrary interruptions.
e.g. If you wanted to impose a limit on the maximum number of calls you could do it by modifying the reducer as follows:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">StopReducing</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ne">Exception</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Reducer</span><span class="p">:</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span>
        <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="n">max_calls</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1000</span>
    <span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_calls</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">max_calls</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call_count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_interesting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">test_case</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call_count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call_count</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">max_calls</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">raise</span> <span class="n">StopReducing</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">result</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">reduce</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="o">...</span>
        <span class="k">except</span> <span class="n">StopReducing</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(People will, at this point, complain that I am using exceptions for control flow. Yes I am. What of it?)</p>


<p>One downside to this design is that it doesn't play that well with multithreading. This isn't a major problem in Python, so I haven't spent much time working on it, but roughly there are two obvious things you can do with this design: You can make the best test case thread local and then merge by taking the minimum when you join threads, or you can make your reduction passes single-threaded but use speculative concurrency to speed them up. This latter approach is roughly what reducers like <a href="https://github.com/googleprojectzero/halfempty">halfempty</a>. I've experimented a bit with this in some reducer prototypes, but not in Hypothesis where it's not especially useful because Python.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Reducing Weird Tests</p>


<dl class="metadata">

<p>Hillel recently wrote about <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/fd1f0758-ae31-4e83-9138-33721cbd5ce3">cross-branch testing</a> - comparing implementations of the same API in two different branches as a form of differential testing to see whether a change introduced any functional differences.
As part of his example he ended up with what was functionally the following interestingness test:</p>


<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">is_interesting</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre></div>


<p>He mentions in the article that this gives nondeterministic results for Hypothesis:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Running this gives us an erroneous input:</p>
<p><code>Falsifying example: test_f(a=5, b=6, c=5,)</code></p>
<p>This is nondeterministic: I’ve also gotten <code>(0, 4, 0)</code> and <code>(-114, -114, -26354)</code> as error cases.</p>
</blockquote>


<p><code>(0, 4, 0)</code> is the (probably globally) correct answer of all of these according to Hypothesis's reduction logic,
but Hypothesis's test-case reduction is unable to reliably transform all of the failing examples to it.</p>


<p>I reacted to this as I always do to such things: "Oh, I wonder if I can make the test-case reducer better". But the answer is no, no I cannot, and the reason is that this test contains what is basically a hash function (not a very good hash function, but good enough), and as a result the test cases are pretty much uniformly distributed throughout the set of test cases - if you generate test cases where the values are between <code>-10</code> and <code>10</code>, then of the <code>9261</code> possible test cases, <code>129</code> are interesting, i.e. about <code>1.4%</code> which is about what you'd expect if the computation of <code>abs(out) % 100</code> were roughly randomly distributed.</p>


<p>For such functions we end up with the slightly awkward situation where:</p>


<ol>
<li>It's not that hard to find test cases (<code>1%</code> isn't that infrequent! We can just exhaustively enumerate to find the globally minimal test case).</li>
<li>It's hard enough to find test cases that most test-cases are locally minimal.</li>
</ol>


<p>The reason for (2) is that if reductions are not any more likely to be interesting than any other test case (which seems roughly true for hillel's example and is true by construction for truly random examples), if you try \(N\) reductions you only expect \(0.01 N\) reductions to work. Suppose for a typical triple of integers we have, say, <code>10</code> reductions we can perform, and those reductions are no more likely than chance to work, then <code>90%</code> of interesting test cases are locally minimal, which means that we'll typically end the reduction process within a few steps.</p>


<p>In order to explore this, lets consider the following toy model: Our space of interesting test cases are triples of integers between <code>0</code> and <code>10</code>, and we have a local reducer that makes the following transformations:</p>

<p>(if this doesn't make sense to you don't worry about it too much, it's just the first local reducer that came to mind for triples of integers)</p>


<p>Suppose we're reducing subject to an interesting test where the maximal value <code>(10, 10, 10)</code> is always interesting and every other test case is interesting with probability <code>p</code>. What is the probability that this local reducer finds the globally optimal test case?</p>


<p>Based on some fairly crude simulations, the local reducer starts finding the globally optimal test-case more than half the time around <code>p = 0.93</code>, which has the amusing property that the local reducer is reliably worse (in expectation) than the reducer that just always tries <code>(0, 0, 0)</code> and gives up if that doesn't work (which finds the globally minimal test case with probability <code>p</code>). Some equally crude simulation suggests that an approach that just enumerates the smallest test cases for a while returns at least as good a result in the same number of calls to the interestingness test in at least 80% of cases, regardless of the value of <code>p</code>.</p>


<p>I'm not sure if there's any sort of general lesson to derive here - most interestingness tests are not quite this adversarial - but I do feel like there is often something like this going on, where the reduction problem isn't that hard despite being in a local minimum, and I wonder if something loosely inspired by this that estimates the density of interesting test cases below the current interesting test case, but I'm not sure if that's entirely useful.</p>


<p>If one <em>did</em> have some sort of easy way to sample from test cases that are strictly smaller than the current interesting test case, it might be worth running that for longer than it would be intuitively obviously useful as a sort of crude but perhaps surprisingly effective reducer? It's certainly more robust to this sort of problem than any kind of local transformation based reducer would be. </p>


<p>This also suggests that possibly test-case reducers should try a bit more bounded exploration of the small test cases than they currently do, but I think this is probably misleading due to the relatively small number of test cases in this example - for most formats of interest the number of test cases of size <code>n</code> is exponential in <code>n</code>, so any amount of enumeration other than trying the globally minimal test case (which <em>is</em> usually worth doing) is probably not worth it.</p>

<p>I had some half-formed thoughts about test-case reduction that I wanted to work through, and this notebook is a place for working through half-formed thoughts, so here we go...</p>


<p>The thing I've been working on on and off for about a month now is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-07-05-11:29.html">using language inference to figure out new reduction passes</a>.</p>


<p>It can be thought of as a way of taking an idea that doesn't work (using L* for test case reduction) and combining it with an idea that works but doesn't generalise well (learning a table of small string substitutions to make),
and getting an idea that does work and does generalise.</p>


<p>This has me thinking: What, exactly, does it mean for an approach to test-case reduction to generalise?</p>


<p>Also <em>does</em> this approach generalise well? The big question with it is basically whether it works well when you change the interestingness test. I think it will, but it probably depends a lot on the choice of interestingness test and how close your reducer is to normalising it already.</p>


<p>In the approach to test-case reduction I favour, test-case reduction starts from set of test cases \(X\) and a total order \(\preceq\) over \(X\) called the <em>reduction order</em>,
and a test-case reducer is a function \(r(U, x)\) where \(x \in U \subseteq X\), \(r(U, x) \in U\), and \(r(U, x) \preceq x\). For me usually \(X\) is a set of strings and \(\preceq\) is the shortlex order where \(x \preceq y\) if \(|x| &lt; |y|\) or \(|x| = |y|\) and \(x \leq y\) lexicographically.</p>


<p>Your prototypical test-case reducer starts from a bunch of small-step reductions, which gives you a function \(t: X \to X^{&lt;\omega}\), where \(t(x)_i \prec x\),
and the reducer greedily tries each of \(t(x)_i\) in order. If none of them are in \(U\) it returns \(x\), otherwise it it recurses and returns \(r(U, t(x)_i)\) for the first \(i\) with \(t(x)_i \in U\).</p>


<p>More generally given such a function we might say that a reducer is \(t\)-local if it satisfies the following conditions:</p>


<ol>
<li>\(t(U, x) = x\) if and only if \(t(x)_i \not\in U\) for all \(i\).</li>
<li>For all \(U, x\) is some sequence \(x = x_0, \ldots, x_n = r(U, x)\) with \(x_{i + 1} \in t(x)_i\) (note that we don't necessarily require that \(x_i \in U\)).</li>
</ol>


<p>That is, basically a \(t\)-local reducer is one that looks like the prototypical reducer but may have some optimisations and fiddly bits. e.g. delta debugging is a \(t\) local reducer where \(t\) is maps \(x\) to all test cases that can be formed by deleting a single element of \(x\). Delta debugging starts by trying large bulk combinations of these deletions and gradually narrows it down until it's only trying the small ones. Another approach which uses the same \(t\) but a different algorithm is what I've called <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2017/06/adaptive-delta-debugging/">adaptive delta debugging</a>.</p>


<p>Most reducers implemented in practice are roughly \(t\)-local for some \(t\) (often they fail to be \(t\)-local in some cases because they hit some internal limit and stop when they could be making more progress, and rerunning the reducer may produce further redctions) and I think this is good because it allows you to reason in terms of what transformations they are capable of performing.</p>


<p>So lets assume we have a \(t\)-local reducer. What makes it good?</p>


<p>Basically the tradeoff is this:</p>


<ol>
<li>The larger \(|t(x)|\) tends to be the better you will reduce \(x\).</li>
<li>The smaller \(|t(x)|\) is the better your reducer tends to perform.</li>
</ol>


<p>The ideal seems to be that you want \(|t(x)| = O(|x|)\), as per delta debugging, and the trick is to tweak the set within that constraints to try to get good results.</p>


<p>(Note that having \(|t(x)| = O(|x|)\) doesn't mean that the overall reducer runs in \(O(|x|)\) - even if you reduce the size at every step you can easily be made to make \(O(|x|^2)\) membership checks, and if you just make lexicographic transformations it's easy for performance to get exponentially bad)</p>


<p>The problem that you run into is that basically what you really want is not just for \(|t(x)|\) to be large, but for it to contain values that are in some sense "likely to be in \(U\)". One way this can fail to happen is when there is some sort of precondition on the range of \(U\) we are interested in. The biggest example of this is when interesting test cases have to be syntactically valid according to some grammar. When this happens, effectively you are censoring \(t\) by replacing it with its syntactically valid subset. Often when something like delta debugging gets stuck it's not because it's not because of any intrinsic limitation related to the interestingness test, it's just ended up at a point where \(t(x)\) contains no syntactically valid test-cases.</p>


<p>So, essentially what we want in order to get a good reducer for a format is to try to ensure that \(t(x)\) is always well populated with <em>syntactically valid</em> reductions of \(x\). </p>


<p>One way to do this might be to artificially construct interestingness tests that are basically designed to expose small reductions. I'm not quite sure what those would be. One thing I was thinking of is having interestingness tests of where \(x\) is interesting if \(y \preceq x\) for some fixed \(y\), then once those are normalised gradually "censor" the tests by removing all intermediate parts, stopping when you can't learn anything other than the direct jump to \(y\).</p>


<p>This can be thought of as ensuring that whenever the final reduced result is \(y\) you have as rich a set of paths leading to it as the learning process is possibly able to find.</p>


<p>I don't yet know how likely this is to work. I'm planning to do more experiments soon on getting this running on hypothesis-csmith and we'll see how well it can learn that, but I think there's some interesting stuff to investigate here.</p>
