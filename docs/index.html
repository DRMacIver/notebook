<p class="subtitle">Anxiety vs Worry</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-03</dd>
</dl>


<p>Here is a distinction I've found useful recently: You are <em>anxious</em> about something if the emotion attaches to the uncertainty in the situation, you are <em>worried</em> about something if the emotion attaches to the possible outcomes.</p>


<p>NB that this doesn't <em>perfectly</em> track colloquial usage, but I think it works pretty well with it.
Also if you're not sure how to tell what the emotion attaches to, may I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2UWXQDL">Focusing</a>?</p>


<p>It's certainly possible to worry about things without being particularly anxious about them. Sensible precautions often work like this: e.g. I lock my door because I'm worried that if I don't people might otherwise come in and steal stuff, but there's no anxiety attached to that worry because it's just something I can act on to limit the chances.</p>


<p>You can be anxious without worry in situations when all of the potential outcomes are positive (it's also possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misattribution_of_arousal">to mistake excitement for anxiety</a> in these scenarios, but the anxiety can be real too). If one possible outcome </p>


<p>Anxiety and worry are far from mutually exclusive, and indeed tend to go hand in hand, but it is worth <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html">untangling</a> the two conceptually,
and even where both are present they are still different emotions.</p>


<p>For example, with COVID-19, I  am <em>worried</em> about specific outcomes - harm to people in general, harm to people I love, overall negative societal effects, but am also also COVID-19 has more or less destroyed my ability to reason about the future, and that makes me <em>anxious</em>.</p>


<p>In the COVID-19 case the anxiety feels almost more like an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-06-07:46.html">existential feeling</a> - there's not a specific thing I'm anxious about so much as a general sense that the unknown unknowns are dwarfing the known unknowns, let alone the known knowns (the unknown knowns remain huge given how ideological responses are being). The thing that is making me anxious is the uncertainty itself, not the bad outcomes possible.</p>


<p>Reducing worry is often more tractable than reducing anxiety, because you can reduce worry by planning. If you have a scenario you're worried about, you can ensure that you're prepared for it (e.g. COVID-19 precautions, or talking through your concerns about a situation with the people involved before you get into it). I like Chris Hadfield's advice for dealing with worry, which is "Figure out the next thing that's going to kill you" - plan for the worst, and convince yourself you can handle it. Also often what you're worrying about is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-03-09:07.html">outdated scenarios that no longer apply</a>, so <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">learning to debug that can help with this</a>.</p>


<p>Anxiety can be resolved by reducing uncertainty by making the situation more deterministic, but often that's not a good idea! <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">A certain amount of nondeterminism is often very useful</a>, and many of the ways to reduce uncertainty do this by increasing the chances of failure (e.g. procrastination until it's too late to do a good job).</p>


<p>There are a couple of things you can do:</p>


<ol>
<li>Focus on any worries first, because often a lack of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety</a> is the thing that makes uncertainty uncomfortable. Uncertainty isn't intrinsically bad, because if you're always certain you'll never learn anything.</li>
<li>See if you can reframe any of the anxiety. For example, you can be uncertain about the outcome but certain of your ability to handle it. Can you focus on that? Are there good things about the uncertainty too? Can you appreciate those as excitement? (This one rarely to never works for me)</li>
<li>If you've managed to get your anxiety down to a low enough level, it can be worth practicing a certain amount of discomfort tolerance. Anxiety isn't intrinsically bad, it may be telling you useful information about the world, so the correct amount of anxiety may be non-zero, and it's important to acknowledge that and be prepared to sit with it.</li>
<li>If you've not managed to get your anxiety down to a low enough level, often me neither I'm afraid (I've got a lot better since I've acquired the "legacy code" tools). Consult someone with better advice than me and let me know what they said.</li>

<p class="subtitle">Teleology is fake</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>Tobi has written about <a href="https://ramble.rixx.de/2020/03/30/on-origin-stories.html">origin stories</a> and the importance of asking "What is this for?" instead of "Where does this come from?". He doesn't use the word teleology (the study of the purpose of things) but in the Adlerian psychology the post is based on that is what he's talking about.</p>


<p>I've previously talked about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">the usefulness of teleology in understanding our emotional reactions</a> and how understanding the purpose of an emotional reaction (its teleology) is important to adjusting it.</p>


<p>Both Tobi and my posts have the same aetiology (origin story), which is that we read The Courage to be Disliked (a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html">useful yet punchable book</a>), which is in large part about using an understanding of teleology to change your social behaviours.</p>


<p>I do not want to minimize the importance of this approach, which is very powerful and important, but it does have a critical problem with it: Teleology is fake. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-11-07:15.html">Things don't happen for reasons</a>.</p>


<p>Questions to ponder:</p>


<ul>
<li>Why is this fence here?</li>
<li>Why do giraffes have long necks?</li>
<li>Why am I taking singing classes?</li>
</ul>


<p>The answer to all of these questions is: There isn't a good reason, but they're still important. Teleology is fake.</p>


<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence">Chesterton's fence</a> is the idea that if there is a fence in a field, you should not take it down unless you know the reason why it is there:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'</p>
</blockquote>


<p>But "Why is this fence here?" is a slippery question. Do we mean it as a question of aetiology or teleology? "What is the use of this fence?" is a very different question from "Who put this fence here and why?". You might answer the latter, find out that it is for reasons that no longer apply, and tear the fence down, and discover that the local ecology collapses because now grazing sheep can get somewhere they previously couldn't.</p>


<p>There's a quote that is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/7659686-tradition-is-a-set-of-solutions-for-which-we-have">apparently from a sci-fi novel I've never read</a>, by Donald Kingsbury:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>“Tradition is a set of solutions for which we have forgotten the problems. Throw away the solution and you get the problem back. Sometimes the problem has mutated or disappeared. Often it is still there as strong as it ever was.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This, like Chesterton's fence, is an extremely conservative principle against reform that is also wildly optimistic about how easy reform is.</p>


<p>The problem is that tradition is not just a solution to problems we've forgotten, it's also a foundational layer on which we have built subsequent things. In the fence example, maybe the sheep came long after the fence, and were just never a problem before now. Changing the tradition invalidates foundational assumptions for many other things you were doing, possibly without even knowing they were there.</p>


<p>Now lets talk about giraffes. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-31-09:52.html">Animals are a good model for social behaviour after all</a>.
Why do giraffes have long necks?</p>


<p>Well there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe#Neck">a couple possible reasons</a>:</p>


<ul>
<li>Access to high up leaves which lets them outcompete other grazers by having more food supply.</li>
<li>Sexual selection (male giraffes fight by beating each other using their necks. It's terrifying).</li>
<li>Being able to see predators from further away.</li>
</ul>


<p>All of these seem to be good hypotheses. Which one is the true reason?</p>


<p>Well... probably all of them. Evolution doesn't actually do things for reasons. Evolution just tries random nonsense, and sometimes the random nonsense proves useful in ways that gives a net advantage. If something is useful for multiple weak reasons, that's just as good as it being useful for a single strong reason (potentially even better! More robust, more directions to develop in). So the "reason" giraffes have long necks might just be "All of the above, plus some things we didn't think of, plus these add up to being worth the cost".</p>


<p>Evolution doesn't design things how a human designer sits down and design things (although in practice things created by humans are also designed in an evolutionary way, but the "mutation" process is a bit more directed) - it doesn't need simple legible reasons for what it does, it just <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">tries stuff</a> and sees how it pans out.</p>


<p>(Even this is of course too much of an anthropomorphisation of evolution, but it's a useful one)</p>


<p>Moving away from complex messy evolved systems that make no sense to instead discussing the human mind and its decision making, which obviously makes complete sense, I'm going to be taking singing lessons once the pandemic has lifted and I can find a teacher.</p>


<p>Why? Well...</p>


<ul>
<li>I'm not very good at breathing and want to get better at it.</li>
<li>I'm slightly embarrassed about how bad I am at singing.</li>
<li>I do a lot of public speaking and I'd like to be better at projecting as a result.</li>
<li>Better voice control seems an interesting skill.</li>
<li>It's a great embodiment practice.</li>
<li>It ties in well with Alexander Technique, which I'm learning.</li>
<li>It seems fun.</li>
<li>It would be a good self-confidence boost to be able to be good at singing.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those are the big ones, but there are more. But no single one of these is remotely close to enough to convince me to learn to sing. Any two or three wouldn't be. What's convinced me to learn to sing is that an accumulation of enough good, individually insufficient, reasons, has tipped it over to the point where the cost-benefit analysis is a clear net win.</p>


<p>This is how everything works. Teleology is a useful lens to look at problems through, and should not be discarded, but ultimately if we think things are happening for a simple, clear, and comprehensible purpose, and that if we change them then nothing will change except insofar as it is related to that purpose, we're going to be in for an unpleasant surprise.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The problem of deduction</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-01</dd>
</dl>


<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1245261142966050822">I mentioned on Twitter earlier</a> I am trying to reread books I've already read a bit more, because I'm failing to read new material. Not reading them cover to cover, just dipping in and refreshing my mind about interesting bits, seeing how it fits in with new information, etc.</p>


<p>The book I picked up to do this with this morning is Harman and Kulkarni's book <a href="https://amzn.to/2R2dL2z">Reliable Reasoning</a>. Great book. Strong recommend if you've got the prerequisites (mild mathematical and philosophical sophistication) and are interested in the subject (inductive reasoning and what we can learn about it from statistics).</p>


<p>I opened it in the middle, decided I needed some refreshing on the first chapter, so went back to that and read it for a bit. On doing so I encountered a bit which caused me to go "Hmm. This is a good and powerful insight. I must remember it."</p>


<p>There is, however, a problem, which is that having that insight makes me realise that this is the <em>third time that's happened</em>. So now I'm going to explain it to you so that hopefully I'll remember it.</p>


<p>The official story: Deductive reasoning is when you go "All A are B. This is an A. Therefore it is a B". Inductive reasoning is when you go "All A I've seen so far are B. This is an A. Therefore it is a B". The former is obviously valid. The latter is obviously invalid.</p>


<p>I've <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-15:59.html">mentioned my favourite joke before</a> but here it is again:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>There’s a joke about a planet full of people who believe in antiinduction: if the sun has risen every day in the past, then today, we should expect that it won’t. As a result, these people are all starving and living in poverty. Someone visits the planet and tells them, “Hey, why are you still using this anti-induction philosophy? You’re living in horrible poverty!” “Well, it never worked before...”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The problem of induction is basically "Why is induction so weird compared to deduction?". Deduction is based on seemingly universally applicable principles, it's reliable and trustworthy. It really is true that if all A are B and this is an A it must be a B. That's just how logic works. In contrast, the inductive version <em>isn't</em> true - we're in the middle of a major <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swan event</a> right now, so we know damn well that sometimes the world surprises you.</p>


<p>This book offers a surprisingly good answer: This question is a category error.</p>


<p>Deductive reasoning isn't a thing, because deduction is not a reasoning process. It is a logic of what follows from what. You can build reasoning on top of that, but you cannot do reasoning with it.</p>


<p>Suppose you believe all swans are white, and that this bird is a swan, and that this bird is black. This is, deductively speaking, an inconsistent set of beliefs. As it is inconsistent, anything follows from it. From a black swan it follows that eating cabbage grants you immortality. However, we would look quite suspiciously on this as a line of reasoning I hope.</p>


<p>The way the book puts this is:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>From inconsistent beliefs, everything follows. But it is not the case that from inconsistent beliefs one can infer everything.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It is true that if we believe all three of 1) All swans are white, 2) This bird is a swan, and 3) This bird is black,
then anything follows, but our inference procedure from here is not that we infer whatever we like, it's that we stop believing one of these things (or choose to remain inconsistent and are very cautious about what we infer from them).
Deductive logic doesn't give us any insight as to which of these things we should drop.</p>


<p>It is still the case that a deductive argument from premises to conclusions is universally valid.
It is <em>true</em> that if all three of these things hold then cabbage makes you immortal. This is a valid deductive argument. But a deductive argument is not a reasoning process.</p>


<p>The category error is thus that deduction is a process of argumentation about what follows from what, and induction is a process of reasoning of how we infer beliefs from information. These are not the same thing, and when you properly integrate deduction into the reasoning process what you find is that actually most of the things that were straightforward about it don't help you.</p>


<p>So, if you want to know why induction is so weird, the reason is that induction is the bit that lets you actually reason and infer things about reality, and the problem of deduction is that it can't actually do that for you.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Vampire bats as a model for flirting</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-31</dd>
</dl>


<p>Because <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-29-21:16.html">everything is a teachable moment</a> and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-24-10:37.html">all knowledge is connected</a>, I'm now going to explain why the social behaviour of vampire bats tells us important things about flirting.</p>


<p>Disclaimer: I am bad at flirting. I've got a lot better at it recently, but I am definitely not good at it. This is a post based on the process of my becoming less bad at it. Fortunately that's <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahdoingthing/status/877018612447313920/photo/1">apparently the perfect time to write about such things</a>.</p>


<p>Anyway, before we talk about flirting, lets talk about vampire bats. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/science/vampire-bats-blood.html">Vampire bats know sharing blood with friends is good manners</a>, and this is how flirting works too. Well, flirting rarely involves the sharing of blood except for at very specific sorts of parties that I do not get invited to, but the general principle is sound.</p>


<p>The way vampire bats share blood between non-kin is that they start by grooming. If that's reciprocated, they maybe share a little bit of blood. If that too is reciprocated, they share more, and so on. They <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-24-09:46.html">build trust</a> by repeatedly offering slightly more than was previously offered, and waiting to see if it's reciprocated. This is called a raising-the-stakes game. The general strategy is described in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/28160">Development of cooperative relationships through increasing investment</a>, although I confess to not actually having read it yet.</p>


<p>This is also how flirting works.</p>


<p>I previously wrote <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">about sexiness and the process of attraction</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Experiencing someone as sexy is about fascination. You see something about them, and it draws you in, and makes you want to learn more about them and to explore it. It makes you want more of it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Skillfull flirting is about mutually cooperating to escalate this fascination. You exhibit interest, to see if it is reciprocated, and you progressively dance your way through this back and forth, each of you expressing some interest and seeing how the other responds to it. If they don't, you back off (or at least stop escalating and stay at the currently comfortable level). If they do, you escalate further.</p>


<p>Eventually, if you both want it to, you've each drawn the other in enough that it becomes time to make the fascination more explicit, either by action (e.g. kissing) or talking about it, but this doesn't have to happen. Flirtation is about escalating fascination, but you don't have to keep escalating, you can just have fun with it at whatever level you like.</p>


<p>This can go wrong in three major ways.</p>


<p>The first is that you can just mess it up. Unskillful performance of flirting is incompetent, and thus unsexy, so may turn the other party off and lose the fascination. (If you're lucky and they're into you it may be adorable rather than unsexy, which has some chance of success. If I'm honest this is historically the most successful flirting strategy I have adopted).</p>


<p>The second, is that you may lack the skills of picking up on interest. This is particularly true if you struggle to conceive of yourself as attractive (you miss interest that is there). It can also be true if you read interest that is not there (men are often bad at this - I've heard it said that men tend to overinterpret friendliness as flirting and women tend to overinterpret flirting as friendliness), but that tends to lead to unskillful performance.</p>


<p>The third, and is the way I have personally failed at this until recently, is that you can be bad at showing interest you actually feel.</p>


<p>If attraction is fascination, then flirting is a process by which you create attraction. Usually it starts from some initial seed, but it can go down as well as up - if your attraction is very obviously not reciprocated, it will tend to diminish (this isn't always true, and there are some ways the opposite can play out, but they tend to be predicated on both a high level of initial attraction and the possibility in principle of it being reciprocated).</p>


<p>A consequence of that is this is that unless you are in some way extraordinarily attractive, unless you can demonstrate the attraction you feel towards others, they will probably not exhibit much attraction to you. If you find yourself in a situation where people just don't seem to find you attractive, consider whether that might be what's going on.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Desire as a driver of growth</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-03-30</dd>
</dl>


<p>I wrote before about how <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">safety is the enabler of growth</a>: The thing that allows you to grow is to be safe to experiment, so you can learn new ways of being.</p>


<p>This is true as far as it goes, but it has a big problem: If you're safe, it's very easy to just stay where you are.
The possibility to grow exists, but you have no particular reason to take it, so you don't.</p>


<p>You can see this in the stereotype of the spoiled rich kid (although often they're not exactly in safe environments either, so this is weak evidence. Consider it an illustrative example).</p>


<p>The basic problem is that growth is hard work. You have to want to do it. You have to actually <em>desire</em> to grow.</p>


<p>One key to doing this is what I wrote about in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-23-15:52.html">life as an anytime algorithm</a>: Designing goals so that you gain partial benefits as you go. This ensures that you're getting feedback on growth as you proceed, and it doesn't feel like <a href="https://www.fvathynevgl.com/momentum/">a long hard slog with hopefully a reward at the end</a>.</p>


<p>This isn't enough, because it depends on what type of progress you're making. In particular, I reliably find that progress that just makes things less bad doesn't have the right shape. 
The nagging urge is always there to backslide and just fall back to the old ways. The old ways weren't good, but they sure were easier, and stable, and stability is comforting.</p>


<p>In order to create a desire for growth you need the changes you see to be an actively positive thing.
It makes you hungry for more, and the work feels less like work and more like achievement.</p>


<p>Two examples where I have encountered this:</p>


<ul>
<li>In my various work on <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">emotions</a> one of my specific goals has been around the experience of positive emotions. I don't just want to be less miserable, I want to be happier.</li>
<li>I've been working on my diet. This means I no longer have a permanently upset stomach. That's great and all, but it sure is tempting to backslide because pizza is delicious. But... I must admit, I'm really enjoying the weight loss. I know, I know, body positivity, but I feel <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">a lot better about my body</a> than I have in some time, and that's really nice.</li>
</ul>


<p>You need to clear out the negative stuff too (more of my emotion work is on anxiety than joy, but the two feed into each other). It's important not to overfocus on the positive, but without the positive to drive growth you will often give up, and that means you end up doing less work on the negatives in total.</p>
