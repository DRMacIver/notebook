<p class="subtitle">Spock is a Lie</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-14</dd>
</dl>


<p>A lot of people's model of peak intelligence is something like Spock (Star Trek Spock, not developmental psychology Spock): Freed from the petty constraints of petty human emotions, one can become a being of pure logic who can reason perfectly as a result.</p>


<p>There are two basic problems with this goal.</p>


<ol>
<li>Emotions are how you assign value, and it doesn't really matter how good you are at reasoning if you don't have preferences over outcomes.</li>
<li>Also freeing yourself of emotion makes you very bad at reasoning.</li>
</ol>


<p>My favourite representation of Vulcans comes from Diane Duane's <a href="https://amzn.to/2VqGmjn">Spock's World</a>, where she presents the version of Vulcan logic that makes the most sense to me: Vulcans aren't intrinsically logical, we're just seeing the results of a world-wide religious norm of good behaviour. Vulcans absolutely have emotions, it would just be considered extremely rude for them to show them, and as part of that they've got <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-20-09:31.html">very good at managing them</a>. The Vulcans who wouldn't get on board with this religious program left and became Romulans (Romulans also have their own norms around emotion management, but they tend to be more around staying ruthlessly secretive in the face of totalitarian opression. Or follow the path of Absolute Candor and tell everyone about their feelings as part of their assassin training).</p>


<p>Vulcans are thus basically a more emotionally healthy version of the British: The British (especially the British upper middle class) also consider it rude to have emotions in public, but nobody taught us how to manage them, so the result is that most of us are neurotic messes. Vulcans presumably know better than to do this, so probably meditate on their feelings and write emo poetry about them in private.
The problem is that because we only experience Spock from the outside, we conclude that his presentation is his internal experience, and it is impossible that this can be the case given what we see of his behaviour.</p>


<p>Anyway, this is a post about reasoning and emotions, not about Spock's emo poetry about Kirk (I confess I've never actually read any Spock/Kirk, because Kirk does nothing for me and Spock does little).</p>


<p>Damasio's book <a href="https://amzn.to/2xkCetv">Descartes' Error</a> lays out some of the evidence for this in practice: Damage which affects emotional processing usually results in people being unable to make good decisions, in large part because of inability to prioritise.</p>


<p>From a more theoretical standpoint, there are two major obvious candidates for the role of emotion in reasoning:</p>


<ol>
<li>Intuition is a fundamentally emotional experience, and is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-12-11:35.html">essential for good reasoning under time constraints</a>.</li>
<li>Cognitive dissonance is an emotion, and paying attention to it is a major guide for improving our reasoning.</li>
</ol>


<p>Carol Tavris talks about cognitive dissonance in <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2018/07/09/episode-1-carol-tavris-on-mistakes-justification-and-cognitive-dissonance/">Episode 1 of Mindscape</a> and it's very good. She also has a book about this, <a href="https://amzn.to/2XzN7lz">Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me)</a> that I've not yet got around to reading. The really short version is this though: Cognitive dissonance is the unpleasant feeling of noticing yourself holding two contradictory beliefs.</p>


<p>Cognitive dissonance is not intrinsically a bad thing - noticing that contradiction <em>should</em> feel bad, in that you should be driven to reduce it, but because we're all so bad at discomfort tolerance we tend to overreact to cognitive dissonance and as a result come to bad conclusions where we justify having been right all along (often this is learned in a social environment where mistakes were <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-18-11:24.html">unsafe</a>).</p>


<p>The correct response to cognitive dissonance is to treat it as useful information, and to allow it to feed a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-30-23:12.html">desire</a> to be more correct, without overreacting to it. This is hard, and it's easy to fail in either direction: We can ignore the cognitive dissonance altogether, which leaves us with no impetus to improve our reasoning, or we can overreact to it and double down on our existing position, which leaves us stuck in a bad reason.</p>


<p>As a result, epistemic competence (being good at acquiring true knowledge) is fundamentally dependent on emotion management skills: We need to be aware of our emotions, and we need to experience them as safe, otherwise we will end up stuck with bad beliefs.</p>

Sometimes you just get a sense that there's a there there, but you're not quite sure what it is yet.
This post is an attempt to gesture vaguely in the sense of the there that may or may not be there. It probably won't quite make sense yet, because it doesn't yet make sense to <em>me</em>.</p>

<p>Plus a lot of general background stuff beyond that. You don't have to read any of these to understand this post (I hope), but they vaguely are defining the cluster of what I'm thinking about right now. Also I can't promise that this post will make sense if you <em>have</em> read them.</p>


<p>Against the Grain talks about the idea of a <em>domus</em>. The term comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus">the Latin word meaning home</a>, but can more broadly be used to refer to a freeholding and its surrounding cultivation. It is the origin of "domestication", which can be thought of as the process of taking other species and making them suitable for inclusion in the domus.</p>


<p>Because not enough people write like mathematicians, Scott never really precisely defines what he <em>means</em> by domus in any easy to extract form, but the condensation of it in <a href="https://proteviblog.typepad.com/files/notes-on-scott-against-the-grain.pdf">these notes</a> is pretty good:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The “domus” is an assemblage, or concatenation of multiple species and environmental 
features – landscape changes, animal pens, houses, butcher shops, blacksmiths, marketplaces 
and so on – that are put together in varying proportions. It is multi-dimensional long-term 
inherited niche construction</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Scott talks more broadly about the <em>domus complex</em> as the effect of humanity on the landscape. We don't just produce small, tightly concentrated, domestic units, but we broadly reshape the landscape around us, and have been doing so long before anything recognisable as modern agriculture.</p>


<p>Within this broader domus complex, the domus is more like a local increase in concentration of domestication, but the the domestication of the landscape extends out far beyond where you might naturally think of as being the boundary of human presence. The village is domesticated, certainly, but so are the forests around it where humans hunt, and possibly clear with fire, so are the places where evolution is shaped by human predation, or by escaped domesticated species (plant and animal).</p>


<p>And it is not just the rest of the world that is shaped by domestication, but also humanity. In one sense, humanity has shaped grain to serve us. In another sense, grain has shaped humanity to propagate itself. The situation is even more murky when you look at a species like dogs, who we essentially co-evolved with to domesticate each other.</p>


<p>I have <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1126046264125267968">previously argued</a> that you can look at books in the same way as grain: In one sense we create books to serve us, but in another sense books are best seen as a replicator in their own right, using humanity as the background medium of replication.</p>


<p>One could look at a kind of generalised definition of a domus as this: A domus is a set of tightly co-evolved replicators, each of which are dependent on each other and the domus as a whole as a platform driving their success, and which would be significantly altered (and possibly fail entirely) by its removal from the domus.</p>


<p>Books in the absence of humanity cannot replicate. Grain in the absence of humanity is much more subject to the vagaries of weeds, and drought. Humanity in the absence of books would find itself at a significant disadvantage compared to where we are today. Humanity in the absence of grain would starve.</p>


<p>As with Scott's domus complex, the boundary of a generalised domus will usually be fuzzy. There will be things that are obviously in a domus together, and things that are obviously not in a domus together, and a wide range in between. There will also likely tend to be overlapping domus which do not themselves necessarily constitute a larger domus. For example, both a large international business's culture and a city's culture might usefully be considered as domus in their own right, but are not usefully considered as a single unified domus even when the business has an office in that city - although the two domus interact, they do not interact densely enough to be usefully considered as part of the same domus.</p>


<p>This density of interaction is key to whether it is useful to think of a set of replicators as a domus.
Replicators in a domus will create pressure on each other to become more usable to them, by "offering" services. Books create a culture of literacy by turning humans into readers. Grains create a culture of mass agriculture by turning humans into states.</p>


<p>In "Sorting Things Out", Bowker and Star introduce the idea of <em>torque</em>, the twisting of time lines created by people and categorisation systems on each other: When a person interacts with a categorisation, this creates pressure on both the person (to conform) and the categorisation system (to include the person). People's behaviour and categorisation systems are both examples of replicators (they literally evolve over time, in response to replication with variation and selection), and the torque between these replicators as they interact is the process of each making the other more usable to each other. Mutual torque</p>


<p>So, generalising this, we might say that <em>torque</em> is the influence between two replicators to make each other more usable to each other. A domus is thus a set of replicators that exert significant torque on each other,
thereby domesticating each other. Torque creates domestication.</p>


<p>"Where Good Ideas Come From" is a book largely about treating innovation as an evolutionary process (It's not especially convincingly argued, but that's OK for me because I was already on board with most of its ideas and it was nice to see them sketched out a bit more). In it he describes the idea of a <em>platform</em> - an ecosystem that essentially acts as a foundation for other things to develop on top of them. Two examples he gives of such platforms are how coral reefs create atolls, which are highly nutrient dense environments supporting a huge amount of diversity of life, and cities, which have the same function for memetic diversity.</p>


<p>In "The Economy of Cities", Jane Jacobs talks about how cities are essentially the driver of innovation. She also talks about how cities predate agriculture, which I think "Against the Grain" convincingly disproves (depending on what you "count" as agriculture), but I think her broader point is still sound if you replace "city" with "domus", because there really isn't a city / not-city binary. Instead a better reading of this would be that <em>domus density</em> is a huge driver of evolutionary diversity. Any domus serves as a platform, both for the replicators currently in it and for new ones to be brought into the fold.</p>


<p>Jacobs talks about "import replacement", where a city starts producing goods it has previously imported, as a driver of city group. In a domus sense this also occurs as something we might call <em>replicator integration</em>. Once, cats were not part of the domus. Then they started essentially feeding off it (by eating creatures that were parasitizing off the domus). Now cats are a thoroughly integrated part of humanity's domus complex.</p>


<p>The main human domus complex inextricably contains memes (in the original Dawkins sense. Pictures with text on them are less load bearing although still a major feature) - ideas and complexes of ideas which replicate themselves by spreading from person to person. The memetic domus in the title of this post is really just the part of that broader domus that centers on these memetic replicators. It's not necessarily cleanly separable from the rest of the human domus complex, but it's worth considering as an object of study in its own right.</p>


<p>One way in which it is worth studying is cultural. As I wrote before, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-28-06:33.html">culture is deeply contingent</a>. Here the memes that we are interested in are particularly <em>behaviours</em>. When you have a domus, people interact often enough and exert enough torque on each other, than where it is useful to synchronise behaviours to be the same, they generally will. Whenever there is a coordination problem, a domus will tend to create homogoneity through torque.</p>


<p>A domus will also tend to use that torque to resist change. If two previously unlinked domuses start interacting, each will induce torque on the behaviours of the other, but because changing one replicator within a domus will cause it to be less useful to the others, the within-domus torque will tend to be greater than the between-domus torque. If interactions are common enough, the two domus might eventually "merge", and eventually the within-domus torque might be enough to eventually remove the inhomogeneity, but without that the two will tend to remain separate.</p>


<p>A particularly important feature of this when the domus contains humans (technically "human behaviours" as humans don't have to be present in their capacity as replicators for this to be relevant) is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-02-09:31.html">legibility</a> within the domus. Because of this homogenising effect, two people within the same domus will tend to make more sense to each other than people from other domus - many core assumptions about behaviour and communication will be shared and not need explaining, and many shorthands will have been developed that are useful for describing behaviour within the domus. These shorthands will be shared.</p>


<p>This shared legibility is related to something that Kenneth Arrow talks about in "the limits of organization". This is a book about why, if we assume that the price system is very good (which it mostly is, and as an economist Kenneth Arrow is particularly predisposed to believe that it is), why do non-market organisations form? One of the answers he presents to this is that organisations exist to lower communication costs within the organisation, which enables people to acquire information that is valuable but not worth the cost of acquiring it in a broader market economy. Thus by forming an organisation in which communication is cheaper, a number of market failures become soluble.</p>


<p>The mutual legibility within the domus serves a similar function. People will find it easier to communicate with each other, and so many ideas become possible to spread that would not in isolation. Essentially, the domus becomes a platform for a much richer memetic ecosystem that would not be possible without it.</p>


<p>One example of a set of replicators that it is useful to think of as part of a memetic domus is <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-18-12:24.html">the libraries of Pierre Bayard</a>, consisting of various types of books, both literal and figurative, and the collective discussions we have centered around them.</p>


<p>This is all now quite far from the thought process that spawned this post, and I think I will let these ideas bed down a bit more and try to explain it more coherently and go into this thought process a bit more in a later post, but to touch on it briefly: It is useful to think of yourself as embedded in a domus with your own surrounding information architecture (your "exobrain" as I'd often think of it), and it's worth thinking about behaviours in terms of promoting the health of that domus.</p>


<p>For example my own personal memetic domus (something to make me share, something to make me like and subscribe) might contain:</p>


<ol>
<li>The thoughts I have</li>
<li>The conversations I have</li>
<li>Posts on this notebook</li>
<li>Tweets</li>
<li>Books I read</li>
</ol>


<p>It may not seem natural to think of these all as replicators, and some of them are a bit of a stretch I'll grant, but they definitely all exert torque on each other.</p>


<p>The domus forms a platform largely to the degree that it is well connected through torque, so behaviours which <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-09:44.html">promote the formation of ideas</a> will largely be ones that increase torque within your personal memetic domus.</p>


<p>An example of this, which is largely what prompted this very post, is that I've taken to dipping in and out of books and rereading bits of them to remind me of their contents. This has created significantly higher torque between thoughts and books, and (indirectly) between books and this very notebook.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Intuition as search prioritisation</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-12</dd>
</dl>


<p>Computers and algorithms are not an especially good model of the human mind, but they often provide nice toy models for reasoning processes. These don't necessarily capture general features of human reasoning, but they're often still useful toy models for thinking about how reason might work in particular contexts.</p>


<p>In this post I'd like to look at some such toy models and see how intuition can have a big impact on them.</p>


<p>Suppose we have \(N\) items, and we want to find a good one (and know a priori that at least one of them is good). We can check whether any given item is good, but it requires reasonably careful investigation in order to determine an item's goodness.</p>


<p>There's no mystery about what we have to do in in order to find a good item: We go through \(N\) items, one at a time, and keep asking "Is this one good? How about this one? This one?" until we find a good item and return it.</p>


<p>This simplicity hides an important question though: What order do we search through the items in?</p>


<p>If we're lucky and get a good item first, we only need to examine one item. If we're unlucky, we might have to examine all \(N\). If \(N\) is large this may be <em>very</em> expensive.</p>


<p>As a result, our iteration order is the major driver of how efficient this process is. It has no effect on the result of the algorithm, but it significantly impacts its performance.</p>


<p>Intuition can be thought of as the search ordering in this problem: We have some really cheap test that lets us guess whether something is good enough, and we go through the items in order of guessed-good to guessed-bad. If our guesses are remotely accurate, this will speed up the time this takes to find the item.</p>


<p>At this stage, intuition affects only the performance, not the outcome, but in real world decision making often we are time constrained, so we might not have time to search through all \(N\) items. A <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/10/vocabulary-building-satisficing/">satisficing</a> behaviour might be that rather than looking for goodness in some absolute sense, we evaluate \(k\) out of \(N\) items and pick the best among those.</p>


<p>This is effectively the same algorithm as before, but now treated as an <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-23-15:52.html">anytime algorithm</a> - we're allowing for the possibility of interrupting early and using our best result.
<em>Now</em> the order of iteration is still important, because we can observe the quality over time and pick an earlier time to stop, but for essentially the same reason that it affected performance before.</p>


<p>This feature becomes especially important when it's not just impractical but utterly infeasible to evaluate all \(N\) possibilities.
<a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10045895/1/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf">AlphaGo Zero</a> is a particularly good practical instance of a real computer program working a bit like this.</p>


<p>AlphaGo Zero has essentially two components:</p>


<ol>
<li>A tree search, that reasons through and evaluates potential moves for their impact.</li>
<li>A neural network, that looks at the board and history and outputs a set of move probabilities.</li>
</ol>


<p>The tree search is the "reasoning" of the AlphaGo Zero, in that it's the bit that actually attempts to strategise and think through the implications of varying moves, but the neural network is the fast gut feel play.</p>


<p>In theory, AlphaGo Zero would play fine if you were to just make the neural network always pick every move at random and let the tree search be unboundedly deep. In practice, it would play fine by just sitting there generating heat and net never making a move, because trying to do a full tree search on the space of possible Go moves would take longer than the lifetime of the universe.</p>


<p>This means we're in the situation like the above partial search algorithm: Because are constrained on time, the quality of the moves output by the neural network will heavily influence the quality of AlphaGo Zero's decision making.</p>


<p>This is a general phenomenon that repeats over and over again: Making decisions perfectly requires unbounded amounts of time, so at some point we have to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">terminate our decision making process and just make our best guess</a>, and the quality of our intuition helps us prioritise what to consider before we give up. Thus, even the most logical and well reasoned decision making process will usually be heavily dependent on intuition for the quality of its outcome.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Trivial irritations as inhibiting factors</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-11</dd>
</dl>


<p>Historically speaking, I hate podcasts. I could tell you all sorts of reasons why they don't work for me as a medium - auditory processing issues, the fact that I don't really like receiving information in a spoken format, etc.</p>


<p>I've also listened to a lot of podcasts in the last week, and it turns out all of those reasons were wrong, and the actual reason that I didn't like podcasts was that I didn't own wireless headphones.</p>


<p>It turns out that I think podcasts as a medium are <em>fine</em>. They're not great. I very much don't think they're the ideal medium for many things. But there's a lot of good information available in podcast form, so by picking out the ones that work best for me it's relatively easy to get reasonable benefit out of podcasts.</p>


<p>In order to take advantage of that benefit though two things need to hold true:</p>


<ol>
<li>There can't be something I'd rather be doing with that time.</li>
<li>The cost of listening to the podcast has to be smaller than the benefit, otherwise listening to it is a net negative.</li>
</ol>


<p>So for example for (1) podcasts are a good thing to listen to in otherwise "dead" time. e.g. doing chores, during exercise, etc. because they're a good thing for occupying attention then that I wouldn't otherwise be using if that's what I want. This was always true and the benefits of them for that were always present.</p>


<p>But also listening to podcasts on speakers or wired headphones is just that little bit too annoying. Wired headphones to a phone in my pocket during exercise is very annoying - it constrains my movement, there's a risk of the headphones being pulled out, etc. The result was that prior to having wireless headphones it was always just a little bit too irritating for me to listen to podcasts.
As a result, having wireless headphones takes the cost-benefit of podcasts from mildly negative to mildly positive.</p>


<p>This, it turns out, is actually a bigger deal than it sounds, because once the cost-benefit analysis is positive I can start to properly get into it. I've even (gasp) <em>listened to podcasts on wired headphones</em> and it was mostly fine, because I'd already done the work to get into it. So I think in the end the cost-benefit analysis of podcasts will be moderately positive - still not my favourite medium, but something I get a fair bit out of it.</p>


<p>None of my original objections were <em>wrong</em> exactly - they're still all things that I expect mean that podcasts will never be my favourite thing, but they were slightly missing the point because what I needed was to overcome a trivial irritation that I didn't realise was there rather than to make podcasts work better for me.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Maybe everyone was right all along</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-10</dd>
</dl>


<p>A common subject of mockery right now is that a lot of people are treating COVID-19 as evidence that their ideologies were right all along.</p>


<p>I do share a certain amount of amusement over this, but would like to suggest the following counterpoint: Actually, most of these people probably <em>were</em> right all along, at least in some ways.</p>


<p>The easy example is that people calling for greater social safety nets, medical care, etc. who are now going "Hey, you know, maybe those things would have been useful in a pandemic??" are obviously right. Those things <em>would</em> have been useful in a pandemic. The pandemic genuinely is providing good evidence for why people need <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-05/spanish-government-aims-to-roll-out-basic-income-soon">universal basic income</a>, and it really is a damning criticism of a lot of countries' healthcare.</p>


<p>Specifically what's happening here is that the pandemic is highlighting two major problems that were present all along:</p>


<ol>
<li>Many people's lives are extremely financially precarious.</li>
<li>Healthcare, especially emergency care and infectious disease control, is a collective problem that we cannot ethically or practically rely on individuals being able to afford.</li>
</ol>


<p>People who have built significant aspects of their ideology around these problems are in fact entirely justified in saying that the pandemic is proving them right all along, because these problems are real and major and the pandemic really is highlighting them, and there's nothing remotely surprising or controversial about pointing that out.</p>


<p>What I'd like to suggest though is that most other examples of people saying they've been right all along are like this too.</p>


<p>It's tempting to think of ideologies in terms of what proposals they make for radically restructing society,
but I think it's more useful to start with what their <em>critiques</em> of society are. An ideology is, first and foremost, a set of problems that you care about. The proposals made by the ideology are, largely, grounded in those critiques and designed to solve those problems.</p>


<p>Generally critiques start from a real source of pain, and a more or less accurate understanding of the world.
Sometimes that pain is one we want to consider "invalid" (e.g. it's selfish), sometimes that more or less accurate understanding of the world is less more and more less, but on the whole society is messed up in too many different ways for people to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-07:38.html">nerd</a> about all of them, so you end up with a lot of specialist bodies of knowledge each focused on a specific critique, so it's not surprising that this results in a lot of different ideologies.</p>


<p>People's intuition is that all of these ideologies can't be right at the same time, and in some sense that's true,
but I think it misunderstands the nature of ideological conflict.
Ideologies come into conflict in (at least) two different ways:</p>


<ol>
<li>They have incompatible critiques.</li>
<li>They have incompatible solutions.</li>
</ol>


<p>The first absolutely happens of course - e.g. white supremacist ideologies and intersectional feminist ideologies are genuinely in conflict - but I think more often than not it's the second, and it would be perfectly plausible to synthesise the two ideologies into something workable,
because what's actually happening is that they have perfectly compatible complementary critiques of society, but the solutions they proposed don't take into account the other's critiques.</p>


<p>It may not be obvious from the inside that this is happening, because people overidentify problems and solutions (this happens literally all the time, not just in ideological contexts), and even once you realise it's happening it may be genuinely very hard to form that synthesis, but I think until you've done the work to diagnose a conflict it can be worth assuming that this is what's happening - it makes it easier to extend empathy across ideological differences and to learn from other people's critiques of society.</p>


<p>Backtracking to COVID-19 this is, I think, why most people are treating it as evidence that they were right all along:
Their critiques of society were, within their own values, actually pretty accurate, in ways that COVID-19 is showcasing.
Society is constantly <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html">skirting the edge of disaster</a> and COVID-19 came in and threw a spanner in the works, so a lot of the things we did to paper over issues are now fraying, and all of the problems that they were previously noticing are suddenly brought into stark relief.
As a result nobody is going to go "Actually I was wrong, this thing I thought was a problem isn't a problem after all", because the thing they were critiquing is now if anything <em>more</em> of a problem.</p>


<p>As a result, the only way COVID-19 can really change your ideological stance is by convincing you that things you had previously dismissed as non-problems are actually problems they do need to care about. We see this happening with e.g. libertarians and anarchists who are going "Actually, most of my critiques are still valid, but you know this does seem something where massive central coordinated response is helpful. BTW have you noticed that the institutions for doing so are exactly as broken as we said they were?" (We're also seeing this with some privacy advocates who are about facing and going "Wait no surveillance is good actually" but I'm less impressed with those people).
This is largely what I was suggesting was the good sort of ideological incompatibility: The underlying critiques are perfectly compatible, we just need to figure out how to put those together in a more productive way.</p>


<p>Anyway, in short, my ideological stance has always been that we can learn a lot from people with different problems and areas of knowledge than us, and that although it's not true that the "truth lies somewhere in the middle", we probably do need to synthesise things from a wide variety of ideologies and viewpoints if we want to come to a useful conclusion that works for everyone. Fortunately, COVID-19 has proven that I've been right about this all along.</p>
