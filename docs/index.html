<p>Today's Card: The Magician:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The Magician is the archetype of the active, masculine principle - the ultimate achiever. He symbolizes the power to tap universal forces and use them for creative purposes. Note his stance in the picture. He acts as a lightening rod - one arm extended up into the Divine for inspiration, the other pointing toward Earth to ground this potent energy. [note] His abilities appear magical at times because his will helps him achieve what seem to be miracles.</p>
<p>What makes the Magician so powerful? First, he is not afraid to act. He believes in himself and is willing to put that belief on the line. He also knows what he intends to do and why. He doesn't hesitate because he understands his situation exactly. The Magician can focus with single-minded determination. As long as he remembers the divine source of his power, the Magician remains the perfect conduit for miracles.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Susanna Clarke's "<a href="https://amzn.to/3cYqmwd">Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrel</a>" is my natural association for magicians.
A random selection from it gives:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The old King is dead. The new King approaches! And at his approach the world sheds its sorrow. The sins of the old King dissolve like morning mist! The world assumes the character of the new. His virtues fill up the wood and the wold!"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(I've misplaced my physical copy, so this comes from a slightly dodgy PDF so no page number for now until a new copy arrives)</p>


<p>In this scene, Stephen Black has killed The Man With The Thistledown Hair (yes this is really how he is referred to throughout the entire book). As a consequence of this, Stephen Black is now the new king of The Man With The Thistledown Hair's Faerie kingdom of Lost Hope. He intends to be a very different king:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"This house," he told them at last, "is disordered and dirty. Its inhabitants have idled away
their days in pointless pleasures and in celebrations of past cruelties - things that ought not
to be remembered, let alone celebrated. I have often observed it and often regretted it. All
these faults, I shall in time set right."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This isn't the main point I want to cover in this post, but a thing I can't help but noticing is that the interactions between Stephen Black and The Man With The Thistledown Hair are an interesting study in colonialism. Each is a member of a colonised people who has been shaped into a particular vision of what Englishness looks like, and each has deployed that Englishness against others.</p>


<p>In the case of The Man With The Thistledown Hair, he has spent the entire book tormenting Stephen Black by "helping" him in ways that are of no help whatsoever and mostly cause him distress, all the while ignoring what he wants and needs.
Principle among those is that he wants and needs The Man With The Thistledown Hair to <em>leave him alone</em>.</p>


<p>Stephen Black, meanwhile, when given power over Faeries responses as the British (really, the English) have always done: By denigrating the local population as disordered, unclean, and slovenly, and in need of having some proper British values imposed upon them.</p>


<p>(In the context of the story he is of course <em>right</em> that the Faerie are these things, but we are usually right in the version of the stories we tell, and Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell is very English in its viewpoint).</p>


<p>The idea of the new king as the opportunity for the rebirth of society is an interesting one, and is in many ways how we view leaders more broadly. It typically fails in practice, because a leader is less important than the inertia of the system they lead, but we nevertheless persist in the idea that it is possible, and I think a lot of this is because of the role leaders serve for us as vessels into which we can pour our hopes.</p>


<p>I've recently finished reading James C. Scott's "<a href="https://amzn.to/2YfwKer">The Art of Not Being Governed</a>". Chapter 8, "Prophets of Renewal", is about how many of the recurring rebellions by the hill people of South East Asia against the valley dwelling padi states are lead by people styling themselves as prophets and miracle workers (magicians!).</p>


<p>These miracle-workers are often themselves the subject of prophecy, the subject of utopian visions in which the oppressive state is replaced with a utopian one:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>That a Karen King would yet appear.
The Talain [Mon] Kings have had their season
The Burmese Kings have had their season
ANd the foreign Kings will have their season
But the Karen King will yet appear
When the Karen King arriaves
There will only be one monarch
When the Karen King arrives
There will be neither rich nor poor
When the Karen King arrives
Every thing [creature] will be happy
Lions and leopards will lose their savageness</p>
</blockquote>


<p>(Please note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people">the Karen in question</a> have no desire to speak to your manager)</p>


<p>These prophecies are part of a general cultural impetus to rebellion and, as Scott puts it, "prophets are a dime a dozen". It is less that prophets create rebellions and more that prophets are created by the people they lead:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Charisma is, above all, a specific cultural relationship between a would-be prophetic figure and his or her potential following. And because it is a relationship or an interpresonal resonance, we cannot claim that an individual has charisma in the same way we might say that someone has a gold coin in his pocket.</p>
<p>[...] a charismatic connection might be conceived as a specific congregation looking for a preacher whose message it can wholeheartedly embrace and whom it believes it can trust. It is as if the destination is largely known and specified (however ambitious it may be), and the congregation is in search of reliable transportation. The prophet is, in this sense, a vehicle.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>It is the society within which a successful prophet appears that, in effect, lays down the basic script that shapes the prophet's repertoise.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>Let us imagine a bard who lives exclusively by the voluntary contributions of ordinary people in the marketplace. And let us assume, for the sake of argument, that each of those who like what he sings gives him an identical small "copper." Having conjured up a bard who wants to please a large audience, let us further imagine that this bard has a repertoire of, say, a thousand songs and stories from which to select. Assuming that his audience has definite tastes, I imagine that, little by little, as the bard comes to know his audience, the actual songs he sings in the market square - perhaps even the order and style in which he sings them - will come to more closely approximate the distribution of tastes among his audience.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Rather than the prophets leading the the people into rebellion, prophets are a technology that the people use to achieve their goal of rebellion.
A <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-13-11:35.html">domus</a> forms between the general memetic background of the people, their behaviour, and the behaviour of the prophet, with each shaping the others to be better suited to their needs.</p>


<p>Scott is quick to point out that we do need to consider the individual prophets in this:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[This analogy] allows too little for the creativity of the prophet and his capacity to add to the repertoire and to change tastes.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The prophet is absolutely a shaper of the rebellion, but what they are shaping is a kind of... filtering and simplification of the memetic background. A large body of knowledge and beliefs is being filtered through the prophet, and the prophet's job is to essentially distill it into a coherent and punchy narrative. The prophet is the elevator pitch for a larger body of cultural knowledge, and which of many potential prophets succeed is a function of how well they embody this role.</p>


<p>Though we can think of the prophet as the magician, like the two magicians of the book they are also the spell:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"They have their faults, as other men do, but their achievements are still
remarkable. Make no mistake; I am John Uskglass's man. Or would be, if he were here. But
you must admit that the restoration of English magic is their work, not his."</p>
<p>"Their work!" scoffed Vinculus. "Theirs? Do you still not understand? They are the spell John
Uskglass is doing. That is all they have ever been. And he is doing it now!"</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Strange and Norrell may be the spell cast by John Uskglass, but in many ways John Uskglass it not a person, but a personification. John Uskglass <em>is</em> English magic, in more sense than one: He is the codifier of it, but also English magic is grounded in his alliances with England. If Strange and Norrell are the spell cast by John Uskglass, John Uskglass is as much the spell cast by England.</p>


<p>Stephen Black, too, is ultimately the product of this sort of spellcraft. His rise to power comes off the back of a literal spell cast by Strange and Norrell that causes him to, temporarily, embody the power of English magic. Although he is no magician-king, his ability to channel the power of English magic is what grants him the ability to defeat The Man With The Thistledown Hair.</p>


<p>(I cannot help but point out how interesting it is that English magic employed by English aristocrats is both what decides a conflict between two colonised people, and what brought them into conflict in the first place)</p>


<p>Prior to the casting of that spell, Stephen Black is a character distinctly lacking in agency. This isn't his fault, he's merely trapped by someone with significantly more power than him. Prior to that point, all he can do is appease and try to limit the damage that The Man With The Thistledown Hair can do.</p>


<p>However, once he is granted power, with it comes agency: He has the ability to act on that power, and he does.
He embodies the card of the Magician, and through his willingness to act becomes a conduit for miracles.</p>


<p>This, I think, is the other aspect of the role of prophet in a rebellion that it is important to acknowledge:
The prophet may be but the conduit for the power that cast them in this role,
but that power grants them a greater agency than they would otherwise possess, and it is that agency that allows them to make those choices.</p>


<p>In many ways, this increased agency is the purpose of the leader. The <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-24-09:38.html">basic unit of democracy is the discussion</a>, and discussion is slow and ponderous.
The reason why we create and empower these leaders is not just to give <em>them</em> agency, but to experience that agency ourselves through them.</p>


<p>This approach of course has many failure modes, and we're seeing many of those modes in the rise of populism, but it is an understandable desire, and a powerful social technology if we can use it safely. If we get good enough at that technology, perhaps it really will become indistinguishable from magic.</p>

<p class="subtitle">There is no moral obligation to be exhausted</p>


<dl class="metadata">

</dl>


<p>Card Draw: <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/s5.htm">The Five of Swords</a>.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The Five of Swords is about self-interest. Society tells us to think of others, yet we resist. How we can ignore our own concerns and still survive? This dilemma comes from our definition of self. If we view our self as our personality/body, our interests become those that relate to that self. Do I have enough to eat? Am I happy? Do I have all I want?</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Entirely coincidentally, I had a <a href="https://twitter.com/DRMacIver/status/1254712803719610369">Twitter thread about self-interest</a> yesterday:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Taking care of yourself is not selfish but is in fact essential for taking care of others. A thread of resources on this subject for as and when I find or remember them.</p>
<p>Being an example to others (by me): https://drmaciver.com/2019/09/being-an-example-to-others/
If you take care of yourself then others around you will treat that as permission to take care of themselves.</p>
<p>The Unit of Caring on boundaries: https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/113029185206/a-meditation-on-boundaries</p>
<p>Enforcing your own boundaries around what you want is good because it means that others around you don't have to constantly second guess your needs to avoid hurting you.</p>
<p>If you do not prioritise your own recovery, the needs of those around you who are also recovering will burn you right back out. If everyone does this, nobody recovers.</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/quatoria/status/1253047417433395201</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This doesn't perfectly match the card, but definitely overlaps with it.</p>


<p>Further card description:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>We may expand our concern to those we love, but, then, how can we stop there? We are connected to everyone in the long run. In truth, our self is the world. What we do to that world, we do to ourselves. This understanding is so basic, but so infuriatingly easy to forget day-to-day.</p>
<p>In readings, the Five of Swords can mean that you or someone else is forgetting this larger view of self. You are defining your interests too narrowly. If you try to get ahead in isolation, your actions will come back to haunt you later, one way or the other.</p>
<p>Sometimes this card implies a need to put your own interests first. If you are being abused or taken advantage of, you must get free. If you are worn out by demands, take care of yourself. If it is your turn, step forward and claim your due. Just be aware that if you hurt others in the process, your victory will not feel complete.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I'm not yet quite sure what to do with this, so I decided to elaborate by drawing another card and got the <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/s4.htm">Four of Swords</a>. Rest, Contemplation, Quiet Preparation.</p>


<p>This leads to a clear prompt I think, which is the need to conserve your own energy rather than spending all of it on others.</p>


<p>Years ago, a friend made what I thought was an execellent point: If you have norms that you can only assert needs, not desires, then what you end up with is a social system that <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html">skirts the edge of disaster</a> in a specific way: Everyone is constantly, but not quite, on the edge of breaking. When you break, you are allowed to assert your needs, when you are not broken you are not "allowed" to say no.</p>


<p>As with other forms of skirting the edge of disaster, the solution is to move the edge. Whatever point we want people to typically be at is the point at which we need to be able to say no to more demands. If we want people to not be permanently exhausted, we need to be able to say no to demands before we become exhausted.</p>


<p>From Kelsey's article on boundaries:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Back when I thought I was straight I would go on dates with boys. The boys would usually want to kiss me. I disliked kissing, but I thought that their preferences deserved to count as much as mine, and I reasoned that they probably liked kissing more than I disliked kissing. So kissing was a morally good thing to do. I also reasoned that if I told them I disliked the kissing then they’d feel guilty and enjoy it less. So I did not tell them. </p>
<p>I am certain I was making some kind of critical error but it has taken me a long time to figure out what it might be.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think one could easily translate this into spending energy on someone else: Often they will be more in need than you, so it feels internally valid to think that you should spend your energy on them because their need outweighs your need to not be exhausted. Even telling them that you are exhausted feels bad, because it is <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-xpm-2013-apr-07-la-oe-0407-silk-ring-theory-20130407-story.html">a violation of ring theory</a>.</p>


<p>But in fact, this is a bad norm. As well as leaving you burned out and exhausted, it will also cause the people who love you to be unwilling to ask you for help, because they cannot trust you to prioritise your own needs.</p>


<p>I'm going to try something experimental and take a random passage from a book I haven't read yet, which is "<a href="https://amzn.to/3eZaStx">When I say no, I feel guilty</a>" (Vathy <a href="https://www.fvathynevgl.com/cooperative-spherical-cows/">recommended it a while back</a> but I've only recently admitted that I will not read it as an ebook and acquired a physical copy).</p>


<p>I randomly selected page 231, which has the following dialogue between you and your hypothetical coworker, Harry:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>HARRY: Boy, am I glad to see you! I got a real problem and I was afraid I couldn't get anyone to help me out.</p>
<p>YOU: What's the problem?</p>
<p>HARRY: I need to use your car this afternoon.</p>
<p>YOU: Umm. That is a problem, but I don't want to lend out my car this afternoon.</p>
<p>HARRY: Why not?</p>
<p>YOU: I agree you need it, but I just don't want to lend out my car this afternoon.</p>
<p>HARRY: Do you have someplace to go?</p>
<p>YOU: I may want it myself, Harry.</p>
<p>HARRY: When do you need it? I'll get it back on time.</p>
<p>YOU: I'm sure you would, but I just don't want to lend out my car today.</p>
<p>HARRY: Whenever I asked to borrow your car, you always lent it to me before.</p>
<p>YOU: That's true, I did, didn't I?</p>
<p>HARRY: Why won't you lend it to me today? I always took care of it before.</p>
<p>YOU: That's true, Harry, and I can see you're in a jam, but I just don't want to lend my car out today.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think this kind of boundary asserting behaviour is one that is very good to be able to do.
It feels a bit selfish, but selfishness is important if we're to be able to hold on to more than the bare essentials that we need.
When people ask you to spend your energy on them, you have to be able to say no.</p>


<p>quatoria argued in her thread that survivor communities tend to burn each other out:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>and I implore other experienced survivors out there, who are just beginning the process of <em>real</em> recovery, of actual healing - BE CAREFUL with how you spend your time and energy, because so often one of us begins to heal and the overwhelming need around us drives us to burn out</p>
</blockquote>


<p>And this inability to assert your energetic boundaries is a large part of this. Recovery is treated as an obligation to help others recover, but if you do this too soon then the relationships formed around recovery are not <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html">growth relationships</a> but instead <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/990138-she-reached-down-and-picked-a-crab-out-of-a">a crab bucket</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>“She reached down and picked a crab out of a bucket. As it came up it turned out that three more were hanging on to it. "A crab necklace?" giggled Juliet.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's crabs for you," said Verity, disentangling the ones who had hitched a ride. "thick as planks, the lot of them. That's why you can keep them in a bucket without a lid. Any that tries to get out gets pulled back. Yes, as thick as planks."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>In "<a href="https://amzn.to/3cWY3hR">Rewriting the Rules</a>" MJB elaborates on the crab bucket metaphor:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Probably the main thing which prevents us from rewriting our rules is the crab bucket. The other crabs pull us back into the bucket if we show any sign of leaving, and the comfortable cosiness we find in the bucket means we're unlikely to go over the top on our own.</p>
<p>As Terry Pratchett, and the philosopher Michel Foucault, both point out, these days the crab bucket is rarely policed with a mallet. In most arenas it's not that we'll be hit over the head if we leave the bucket, as we would, for example, if we were LGBT in one of the coutnries which still consider that to be a crime. Rather, the crab bucket is policed by our own self-monitoring as we compare ourselves against each other, and try hard to be normal like everyone else - the other crabs. It's policed by the disapproval we fear because it'll reinforce our belief that we're really not okay. It's policed by ridicule, shame, and the fear of standing out from the crowd and being exposed as freakish, weird, or different.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I think prioritising the energetic needs is another way the crab bucket is policed: If you are not able to prioritise your own need to recover and conserve your energy over the needs of those around you, you will be permanently dragged back into the bucket by the fact that there are far more people in your circle of concern than you can possibly manage to save.</p>


<p>This is another form of <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html">the social obligation to be bad at things</a>. Doing better than those around you feels <em>bad</em>, so it becomes impossible to be good at things because as you try to improve you feel the obligation to drag the entire bucket of crabs up with you, which is far beyond your current strength. In fact, you would often do better by first escaping the bucket, and then helping the other crabs out of it one by one. By feeling overly beholden to the needs of others, we create a scenario where we are permanently vaguely miserable, and we also limit our ability to actually help others.</p>


<p>I wrote previously about the difference between <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-07-12:35.html">morally obligatory and morally virtuous</a>, which I think is illuminating here: Helping another person is morally virtuous, but in many cases we treat it as morally obligatory, as something that we <em>have</em> to do if we can.</p>


<p>In fact, however, it may not even be morally virtuous, because it universalises poorly. A moral norm where everyone puts their own oxygen mask on first is one where we can create communities in which people heal and prosper together, because it creates a communal path out of the crab bucket, one where people are able to be not just okay but actively happy, and then to pull others up after them.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Masculinity as a source of sexual hang ups</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-27</dd>
</dl>


<p>I've decided I might start writing a second post on days where I feel like it and have otherwise managed to be productive, and had a relatively good day doing actual PhD writing today so here we are.</p>


<p>Card Draw: <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/wqn.htm">Queen of Wands</a>.</p>


<p>Of the actions, this prompted me to think about "Attractive" and "Self-Assured", which lead me to think of Mark Manson's book "<a href="https://amzn.to/2xhqh7O">Models</a>", which is about how to use self-confidence (the good kind) to become more attractive and successful in dating (It's a much better book than it might sound, but importantly this is the <em>revised</em> edition. The original edition is apparently a much worse and more overtly pick up artist book).</p>


<p>From page 225:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The larger problem is not being completely comfortable with your sexuality and having sex. It's once again a vulnerability issue. This problem reaches much deeper and lurks within our subconscious. The most obvious solution is to simply have as much sex as possible. Getting a steady girlfriend is the best way to do this.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>First thought: Oh god why are so many of the randomisations forcing me to write incredibly uncomfortable and vulnerable pieces?</p>


<p>He's talking about sexual dysfunction ("not being able to get it up"), but I think the idea of "not being completely comfortable with your sexuality and having sex" is actually a very normal experience for men. Frankly I think the least plausible part of this entire paragraph is the idea that there's a statistically relevant audience of men who <em>are</em> comfortable with their sexuality.</p>


<p>We have this idea of male sexuality as being something that is fairly straightforward, but I don't think that's true. <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-19-10:52.html">Masculininity training fucks you up</a> and gives you a whole pile of hangups. Given how heavily our scripts for masculinity center on sex, a lot of those hangups are going to be about sex.</p>


<p>On the theme of attractiveness, I think this ties into a problem that I have previously written about, which is that it is often very hard for <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-27-08:18.html">men to conceive of themself as physically attractive</a>.
Sex is an opportunity to feel, temporarily, like you are an actual object of desire, in a way that we do not, generally, allow men an opportunity to experience.</p>


<p>However, I think by far the more common reason men have such emotional difficulties around sex is not around desire, but around shame, which is heavily tied into the masculine experience of sex.</p>


<p>Men are supposed to be hypersexual, ready for sex at the drop of a hat, always up for it, and any deviation from that is a failure at being a man. Sex is that which validates your masculinity, so a failure to live up to this ideal of hypersexuality is a failure to be a man, failure to be a man is punished aggressively, and it's hard not to <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/08/jiminy-cricket-must-die/">internalise those punishments</a> as shame.</p>


<p>In Brene Brown's "<a href="https://amzn.to/2zsY3aG">Daring Greatly</a>" (p. 102) she talks about male experiences of self-worth and sex. Quoting a young man from one of her group interviews:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>What we're really thinking is "Do you love me? Do you care about me? Do you want me? Am I important to you? Am I good enough?" That's what we're thinking. When it comes to sex, it feels like our life is on the line.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>From another man in the group:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>"It's true. When you want to be with us... in that way... it makes us feel more worthy. We standa a little taller. Believe in ourselves more. I don't know why, but it's true. And I've been married since I was eighteen. It still feels that way with my wife.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>And further:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>[A therapist who had spent more than twenty-five years working with men] explained that from the time boys are eight to ten years old, they learn that initiate sex is their responsibility and that sexual rejection soon becomes the hallmark of masculine shame. He explained, "Even in my own life, when my wife isn't interested, I still have to battle feelings of shame. It doesn't matter if I intellectually understand why she's not in the mood. I'm vulnerable and it's very difficult."</p>
</blockquote>


<p>A lot of how this plays out in practice results in bad behaviour from men - if you feel shame when sexually rejected, it's easy to react in entitled ways (or, frankly, ways that are actually fine but read as entitled when taken against that broader backdrop) - so I don't necessarily expect a great deal of sympathy for men here, but if you can I'd like you to suspend that for now.</p>


<p>One important thing to distinguish here is that men can experience this negative emotional response even without believing they are entitled to sex. This is very much a case where aliefs matter more than beliefs, and <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-14-13:55.html">aliefs are hard to change</a>. If you've had it drummed into you that sexual rejection is a cause for shame, you will feel that shame no matter how much you have internalised healthy norms around consent. Being rejected can be a completely valid thing to do that you will respect to the hilt and still be a source of shame.</p>


<p>A result of this is that there is a lot of identity and emotion bound up in sex for men - in having it, and also being good at it. Failure at this is a trigger for shame, and so there is a significant internal pressure to "succeed" at sex. And pressure is a great way to engage the <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html">brakes</a>, so it's no wonder that a lot of men have performance anxiety, and that this leads to a failure to perform.</p>


<p>(I feel the urge to comment on whether this applies to me personally and I'm going to resist that urge. Assume whatever you like.)</p>


<p>One of the reasons that it's important to talk about all of this is that failure to live up to the stereotypes of masculine sexuality is actually very common, so when we fail to conform to them through perfectly normal individual variation we feel shame over that. This is then compounded when sexual partners, who have heard those same scripts, react badly to our failure to follow them - e.g. because they perceive it as a failure of desire on our part.</p>


<p>This is a key feature in which Mark Manson's advice is <em>really</em> bad. Just getting yourself a girlfriend (or other sexual partner) is not a sufficient solution to the problem of working on your sexual hangups.
Getting a steady partner <em>is</em> very helpful for getting more comfortable with your sexuality, but it's not sufficient and may cause major problems if your partner has bought too much into the standard male sexual scripts.</p>


<p>It is <em>very</em> important, for people of any gender, that if you want to become comfortable with your sexuality you do so with a partner who is supportive of you, and with whom <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html">your relationship is a growth one</a>. Trying to get over your discomfort with sex with a partner who is going to be pushy and judgmental in their reactions to your sexuality (especially to any failure to perform it "properly") will almost inevitably make things much worse.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Telling each other stories</p>


<dl class="metadata">

</dl>


<p>Today's Tarot prompt is "<a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj06.htm">The Lovers</a>".</p>


<p>I've been writing a bunch about relationships recently, so I thought I'd investigate some of its other actions: Establishing personal beliefs and determining values.</p>


<p>This naturally leads me to revisit "<a href="https://amzn.to/3cObm3Y">Finding Our Sea-Legs</a>".</p>


<p>From page 141:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>In this telling of tales, I do not entirely lose the story that I pass on; but neither do I keep hold of it in the same fashion as before. There is a gain and a loss. Both are inevitable, and a strict accounting of the two is impossible. Even if I sit in silence and listen to the stories of others, although at first glance it may seen that in hearing I only make gains, there are also losses, subtle losses: as I hear about another's sister-perhaps about her expertise in cooking aubergines-my own sister seems a greater or lesser aubergine cook than before; when I am told about the wolf, the traveler to my side once encountered on a lonely hillside, the wolf with which I exchanged glances one day in the municipal zoo transforms into a different wolf; and through these subtle, perhaps imperceptible changes in my sister or my wolf, so too I am changed.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Funnily, having gone from the lovers to values to finding our sea legs, we're back at a different meaning of the lovers: Relationships.</p>


<p>Finding Our Sea-Legs is a book about stories, and their interplay with ethics and our experience of others. I <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-21-08:02.html">previously wrote about its focus on the phenomenology of ethics</a>. This passage is more about the other "side" (in fact, the two are intimately related).</p>


<p>It makes me think about a couple of things:</p>


<ul>
<li>The mutability of memory. When we recall our memories, we fundamentally change them, overwriting details. We think of memory as a fixed record of facts, but it's more like stories we tell ourselves and others, over and over again, subtly mutating each time.</li>
<li>The way all observation is theory-laden. It's hard to separate facts from our interpretation of it.</li>
</ul>


<p>As we tell each other stories, we each give each other new ways of looking at the world, and we cast other experiences in that light.</p>


<p>One way I have seen this happening over and over again is when we tell people how we conceptualise our lives, we give them new tools for interpreting theirs. There's the "There's a word for that" moment where you give someone a new hermeneutical resource (a tool for interpretation, such as a new word or conceptual framework. For example, <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2018-11-12-06:24.html">information about trans or non-binary people</a>, or learning about the link between ADHD and <a href="https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-and-adhd/">rejection sensitive dysphoria</a>), but you also see that in more subtle ways. For example, when you tell someone about an abusive behaviour in a relationship, this can cause them to recast similar things <em>they've</em> experienced as abusive. The story didn't give them the concept of abuse, or teach them a new thing about their life, but it gave them the permission to recast the story of their life in new terms that they would not previously have.</p>


<p>When these sorts of events happen, they <em>do</em> change our relationships with people - both past and present. Sometimes these changes are for the worse, realising how bad someone is for you, sometimes they are for the better, helping you realise how much someone means to you. Sometimes they give you new realisations and new directions to grow the relationship in.</p>


<p>I wrote previously about <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-26-07:28.html">growth relationships</a>. I think many of my closest friendships are growth relationships in this sense, to some greater or lesser degree, and several such relationships have ended up as the foundation of our <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-25-16:02.html">mutual support group</a>.</p>


<p>This sort of back and forth is in many ways essential to support group. I've found many of the most useful conversations in support group for me have not been ones centered around problems I've brought to the group (though those have been helpful too - in a few cases, literally life changing) but the conversations we've had around other people's problems - both where I've helped them, and listening to others' advice. Hearing and understanding their stories has given me a new framework to look at my own life.</p>


<p>In one sense, support group consists of getting together and helping each other solve our problems. In another, it is getting together and telling stories about our lives and building a shared interpretation of them. A great deal of why it works so well, and why relationships in general are such a great platform for growth, is that we are building a kind of shared canon of stories that we can build on - the Support Group Cinematic Universe so to speak - with which we can build our interpretive tools together, constantly deepening our understanding of our lives and the values we hold.</p>

<p class="subtitle">78 Thinking Hats</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2020-04-26</dd>
</dl>


<p>This post is breaking the trend and is <em>not</em> based on a random passage from a book, so is a bonus post for today, though it will contain multiple references to books.</p>


<p>In "<a href="https://amzn.to/2VCBSYa">Six Thinking Hats</a>" Edward de Bono talks about the idea of there being six "directions" that you can pull thought in, each of which is best characterised by a coloured hat. Because he's de Bono, and thus a self-important asshole, the book opens as follows:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The Six Thinking Hats method may well be the most important change in human thinking for the past twenty-three hundred years.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Uh huh.</p>


<p>He goes on to say:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>That may seem a rather exaggerated claim but the evidence is beginning to point that way.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>No it isn't, shut up.</p>


<p>Despite my intense dislike for de Bono as a human being, the book isn't bad, and has some moderately useful ideas in it, and each of the different directions of thought <em>is</em> one that is useful to push your thinking in.</p>


<p>To quote his description of the hats (page 13):</p>


<blockquote>
<p><strong>White Hat</strong> White is neutral and objective. The white hat is concerned with objective facts and figures.</p>
<p><strong>Red Hat</strong> Red suggests anger (seeing red), rage and emotions. The red hat gives the emotional view.</p>
<p><strong>Black Hat</strong> Black is sombre and serious. The black hat is cautious and careful. It points out the weaknesses in an idea.</p>
<p><strong>Yellow Hat</strong> Yellow is sunny and positive. The yellow hat is optimistic and covers hope and positive thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Green Hat</strong> Green is grass, vegetation and abundant, fertile growth. The green hat indicates creativity and new ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Blue Hat</strong> Blue is cool, and it is also the colour of the sky, which is above everything else. The blue hat is concerned with control, the organization of the thinking process and the use of other hats.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The hats pair as White and Red, Black and Yellow, Green and Blue, each defining an opposite direction.
The idea is that people adopt a hat at a time, with the hats giving them <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-17-11:40.html">permission</a> to pull their thinking further in that direction than they otherwise would.</p>


<p>Do de Bono's ideas work? Yeah, I think they do. Certainly I've got some good use out of some of his ideas from another of his books, "<a href="https://amzn.to/355DAVj">Lateral Thinking</a>", but I think his ideas work for a very simple reason: It's <em>really</em> hard to come up with things that don't work.
The main thing de Bono's ideas having going for them is that de Bono is very good at marketing his ideas in a way that only causes <em>most</em> people to dismiss them instead of everyone.</p>


<p>His books are short and kinda interesting, so I don't recommend against reading them and might read a few more in future, but I think most of the value they bring comes from the fact that not enough people are doing this sort of thing because it would be <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-29-10:30.html">too weird</a>,
and if you want to use de Bono's work for groups you're better off looking at something like <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">liberating structures</a>.</p>


<p>Basically, I think that almost <em>anything</em> you can do that pulls your thinking in a direction that it doesn't naturally gravitate will prove interesting. We've been seeing that with the recent use of random readings from books to prompt posts - I'm still finding my feet on that a bit, but I think it's been very positive and it's certainly caused me to write things I would not otherwise be writing.</p>


<p>Which ties in to something I've been thinking about for years but have never really got around to doing, which is Tarot reading.</p>


<p>Tarot obviously doesn't let you foresee the future, except insofar as you can already foresee the future because brains are causal reasoning machines that are fairly good at predicting the future on their own. Instead, tarot cards are a tool for randomised prompts for narrative construction, but having those randomised prompts causes you to construct narratives or think about things in ways that you wouldn't necessarily otherwise do.</p>


<p>Learning Tarot "properly" is something I keep putting off, so given the success of the randomised prompts from books, I thought it might be worth integrating some of it into my writing practice.
How exactly this plays out will be something to experiment with, but if nothing else it will drive familiarity with the cards.</p>


<p>For convenient linkability I'll use the cards descriptions from <a href="http://www.learntarot.com/">www.learntarot.com</a> (the author of that site also has <a href="https://amzn.to/3aD3zo7">a book that I'll be consulting</a>).</p>


<p>Today I drew a pair of cards:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/maj02.htm">The High Priestess</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.learntarot.com/p2.htm">The Two of Pentacles</a></li>
</ul>


<p>A core theme of the high priestess is intuition and mystery, paying attention to the subconscious. Actions listed include "Using your intuition" and "Seeking guidance from within". She is described as "the guardian of the unconscious".</p>


<p>The two of pentacles is, among other things, about fun and flexibility. Actions include "going with the flow" and "doing something you enjoy". The two of pentancles is described as "There is nothing quite like the feeling of being graceful and effective at the same time."</p>


<p>This puts me in mind of Focusing and Alexander Technique, two things which are fairly central to my current pursuit of emotional awareness and embodiment work. Focusing is using your bodily sense to learn about your emotional state, while this sort of graceful and effective movement is a key feature of Alexander Technique.</p>


<p>The other thing that is interesting in this link is the idea of "having fun". How do you know when you're having fun? This isn't a rhetorical question. What does "fun" feel like? </p>


<p>I don't know either to be honest. I'm not very good at fun. I can do interest, I can do spontaneity, I can enjoy things, but <em>fun</em> is weird for me. I'm hoping Focusing will help me unpack that a bit, by paying more attention to the phenomenological character of enjoyment and leaning into it a bit (and yes, I am aware that the fact that "How do I have fun? Let's learn more phenomenology!" is very much part of the problem. I am <em>not good</em> at either of these cards, which is part of why they are interesting).</p>


<p>I suspect that fun is only visible to you after the fact. If you're too self-conscious about the fact that you're having fun, you'll forget to have fun. Overthinking is a <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-20-10:52.html">brake</a> on your ability to have fun.</p>


<p>This is part of why the two of pentacles puts me in mind of Alexander Technique. If fun is primarily an embodied state, then <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-21-12:35.html">the half of you that is embodied</a> is much more able to have fun than your cognitive half. Peter Nobes (my Alexander Technique) teacher relates a story of a standup comic: "Are there any intellectuals in the room? Raise your hand." (nobody raises their hand) "Good. Intellectuals don't know how to laugh. They just sit there and stroke their chin and go ah yes I see that's very funny". Highly relatable.</p>


<p>One of the ways I have been deploying both sides of this recently - Focusing and Alexander Technique - is to try to have more fun doing exercise. Doing exercise not because I think I <em>should</em> exercise, but because my body invites me to do so and to enjoy it. Using exercise as a way to engage with my embodied self, and to drop into a flow state. So far it hasn't resulted in a massive amount of exercise, but I've done some most days, and the amount I am doing seems to be going up over time rather than down, and at no point have I done any exercise and resented it.
This is pretty amazing, and makes me think there might be something to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-04-14-13:56.html">this human notion of "fun"</a> you people are always going on about.</p>
