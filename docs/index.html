<p class="subtitle">The humour test for expertise</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-04</dd>
</dl>


<p>A heuristic I sometimes use is this: You understand something at a reasonably expert level if and only if you get the jokes at a level where you could find it funny.</p>


<p>I started thinking about this when I watched this video:</p>


<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VD5I4l9oASg" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>


<p>This video is hilarious. If you don't play Slay the Spire much you won't understand why. I can explain why, and I can even explain why well enough that you in some way understand it, but I cannot explain it in a way that allows you to find it funny without teaching you to play Slay the Spire, because the humour derives entirely from an understanding of the game.</p>


<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/mame/quine-relay">the quite relay</a> is hilarious, but if you're not a programmer you absolutely won't find it funny, it's just weird and pointless.</p>


<p>The reason for this link between expertise and humour is basically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theories_of_humor#Incongruous_juxtaposition_theory">the incongruity theory of humour</a>: You have a particular set of expectations about how the game is played, and the video repeatedly violates those assumptions by playing the game in slightly unexpected ways. This is not how a Defect build is supposed to work, but it's definitely how <em>this</em> Defect build works.</p>


<p>Because humour derives from incongruity, if you can get the jokes in a field then you must have a sense of incongruity. This means that you've internalised the sort of intuition about what the expected normal for the field is - the field's norms of taste, a working knowledge for how everything typically goes and fits together. These are all signs of expertise, that you've progressed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence">Unconscious Competence stage</a>.</p>


<p>The humour test for expertise is itself a sort of joke, and the fact that I find it funny is probably an indication that I've at least started to get something of a handle on the expertise literature (or just that I'm weird), but it's also serious and I think probably points in a number of interesting directions.</p>


<p>In particular, although you can't explain specialist jokes in a way that makes them funny, it may be worth explaining them, as it will often reveal interesting things about expert intuition that might not otherwise be readily accessible.</p>


<p>Another application of the test is that the jokes you find funny probably tell you something about your areas of expertise that you hadn't realised. This may be an uncomfortable realisation because e.g. it causes you to realise quite how much time you've spent playing Slay the Spire.</p>

<p class="subtitle">No shortage of things to write about</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-03</dd>
</dl>


<p>Back in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/fragments-intellectual-diy">Intellectual DIY</a> I recounted a conversation with my father in which I explained that all of my reading and writing was more by way of a vast intellectual DIY project:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>Last year I had a conversation with my father in which he said how impressed he was with my memory and general breadth of knowledge and intellectual achievement, and that he could certainly never do anything like that.</p>
<p>I expressed polite scepticism at this claim and pointed out that his sheer breadth of practical knowledge far outstripped mine. He seems to know everything about DIY, and is generally prepared to wade in and do a good job on just about anything you might expect to do around the home, from heat pump engineering to building furniture. He's been building some stairs recently, as one does. He is finally starting to come around to the idea that maybe he doesn't have to do everything himself, but generally it's not a question of whether he can do it himself, but whether he can do this thing and all of the thousand other tasks he's taken on. This is of course all before we even start on his actual professional skill set (he was a banker before he retired).</p>
<p>He objected that this was not at all the same thing - he just figured things out as he went and refined his skills over time in the course of doing them. He didn't necessarily remember all these things, he just started with the problems he was trying to solve, had the confidence to try things out and see if they worked, and practiced them until he got the knack of it, and then builds on that prior experience for future problems.</p>
<p>“Well yes”, I said. “How do you think I do it?”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This analogy continues to bear fruit, as I had another conversation with him recently, in which he expressed how he was impressed and surprised by how I never ran out of topics to write about. "Well, would you have trouble coming up with things to do on the Mill?", I replied. "No, I guess not." "Same thing, basically."</p>


<p>(The Mill is my parents' house. It's a converted water mill. It's lovely but also a significant amount of work)</p>


<p>I think when people think of writing, people think of it as trying to create something new in the world,
but actually most of my writing has very little creativity to its selection of topics, I'm just responding to a particular concrete thing I've encountered.</p>


<p>If you look at <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2021-07-02-09:29.html">yesterday's piece about defining things</a>, there was no primal act of creativity where I had to "come up" with a topic. I was experiencing a thing and I was annoyed about it, so I wrote about it.</p>


<p>Similarly, the day before's piece on the newsletter, <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/telegraph-your-moves">Telegraph your moves</a>, was a specific response to people's responses to some scheduling changes.</p>


<p>Both of these were very mundane prompts, but based on my own evaluation and other people's responses, they both produce pretty top tier pieces.</p>


<p>In general, life is full of problems, and even where there are no well defined problems there's a near infinite amount of detail.
Almost all of that detail you can just look at and go "Huh. What's up with that?" and write something about it.</p>


<p>For me in particular a lot of my reading and writing fits into a sort of broad intellectual program of trying to help people get better at life, for values of "people" that first and foremost includes me. As a result, in order to run out of things to write, I'd have to basically have life solved. I'm uh a little ways away from that. </p>


<p>Generally the problem I have is the opposite: There is <em>too much</em> to write about. This leads to two problems:</p>


<ol>
<li>How do I decide which bits to write about?</li>
<li>How do I write a short piece without pulling in everything?</li>
</ol>


<p>The first part is genuinely hard, and I tend towards the less deliberate: I write about whatever happens to be particularly on my mind when I sit down to write. Sometimes I have to shuffle through a few topics until something clicks, but ultimately (as per <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-25-10:39.html">How to make decisions</a>) when you've got a lot of things that could work the best way is to just pick something arbitrarily. This does result in my topics jumping around a lot, seemingly at random, but I'm OK with that and mostly don't care if other people aren't (and suspect, by and large, people enjoy the novelty factor).</p>


<p>For the second: The way I experience this is that I'm reaching into a giant tangle and tugging on a thread. I start somewhere that seems interesting (such as with a concrete problem), and as I pull related thoughts and information come along with it, constructing a linear narrative as I go. Eventually I find somewhere that feels like a natural stopping point, and I stop. Like right now.</p>

<p class="subtitle">People are bad at defining things</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-02</dd>
</dl>


<p>I'm currently reading a philosophy book, and as a result I am cranky about definitions.
Like everyone who is not a mathematician (or culturally basically a mathematician, such as a computer scientist or theoretical physicist),
philosophers are very bad at defining their terms. The key sin of philosophers is that they love doing it anyway, and think they're good at it, but are for the most part terrible about it unless they've lucked into learning how to do it well from some source that wasn't a bunch of philosophers who think "language games" meant you were supposed to play language as a competitive sport where you score points for using words that nobody else understands.</p>


<p>What I mean by "definition" here, is that when you introduce a new term (or even use an existing term in a specific or unfamilar way), you need to provide people with the ability to understand your usage of it. This doesn't require a precise definition that says exactly what the term means, like a mathematician would, though if you <em>can</em> provide such a thing that is often helpful, but it does require you to introduce enough precision that people can understand what you're talking about.</p>


<p>Most people do not put in nearly enough work into defining novel terms in a way that is usable by the reader.
When you introduce a definition without adequate support, you have essentially put a road block in the reader's path until they have sufficiently understood your definition to proceed.
If you do not help them out in doing this, you have probably lost most of them as a reader,
and almost certainly many of those you retain will misunderstand your point.</p>


<h3>What a good definition is</h3>


<p>The purpose of a definition is to give people enough to grab on to to be able to understand your usage of the term.
As such, it should explain the term (see <a href="https://www.drmaciver.com/2018/10/how-to-explain-anything-to-anyone/">How to explain anything to anyone</a>) and give them some material to work with in developing their understanding on top of that explanation. </p>


<p>A gold standard for definitions contains all of the following characteristics:</p>


<ol>
<li>The term is well separated from surrounding text rather than buried somewhere. The mathematical convention is that we typically have a bolded "<strong>Definition:</strong>" in front of it, often with a number you can refer back to.</li>
<li>It provides an explanation of <em>why we need the term</em>.</li>
<li>It provides an intuitive handle on the term.</li>
<li>It provides as precise an explanation of what the term means as is reasonable.</li>
<li>It is accompanied by at least one <em>positive example</em>, an example of a thing that satisfies the definition, with an explanation of why it is an example.</li>
<li>It is accompanied by at least one <em>negative example</em>, an example of a thing that is close to satisfying the definition but doesn't, with an explanation of why it is not an example.</li>
</ol>


<p>Of these, the examples are in many ways the most important and the most overlooked.</p>


<h3>An example of a bad definition</h3>


<p>In contrast the way most people do it is they shove a new term somewhere in the middle of a paragraph, gesture vaguely at what they mean by it, and then go on to use it in ways that completely fail to track the limited sense in which they've defined it.</p>


<p>The definition that I am currently being cranky about comes from Albert Borgmann's is as follows:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>The early scientific theories of the Western world had both world-articulating and world-explaining significance. To articulate something, i.e., to outline and highlight the crucial features of something is also a kind of explanation. It is the kind of explanation that can satisfy the request for an explanation of a concrete thing or event. I will call it deictic explanation to distinguish it from deductive-nomological or subsumptive explanation.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>If I am being very very charitable, this just about satisfies (2) and (4). It explains why we need the term (it distinguishes a type of explanation that is different from the sort we are considering in the context of a modern scientific explanation), and it more or less defines it as being the sort of explanation that you get by outlining and highlighting th ecrucial features of something. Fair enough.</p>


<p>Anyway, on the very next page this is how the word deictic is used:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>They do have deictic power in the sense of delimiting a set of possible worlds and ruling out certain impossible worlds. We can observe a similar pattern in the development from alchemy by way of chemistry to nuclear physics. Alchemy reflected in its laws a definite world of a limited number of stuffs and transformative forces and processes. Nuclear physics. being a microtheory, allows for an indefinite number of molar worlds.</p>
<p>This pattern in the progress of science has no a priori character. It is an empirical fact that the world can be explained in the powerful scientific theories that we now have. The pace of the discoveries of these theories is a matter of historical fact. But given these two facts, it was inevitable that the deictic power of the sciences waned and all but vanished. This is not a failure of science. Nor is it the case that the deictic achievement of the earlier sciences was unquestionable or unique. Art has always been the supreme deictic discipline. Art in turn has sometimes been one with philosophy, religion, and politics; at other times these disciplines have complemented or competed with one another as disciplines of deictic explanation.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This subsequent usage <em>very</em> much makes me question whether I have understood his meaning.</p>


<p>As near as I can tell, "deictic" means something along the lines of "indexical", which means something along the lines of "pointing to a specific thing" (thanks to <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">a literal banana for explaining this</a>). Something is deictic to the degree that it concerns a specific thing in all its glory, in contrast to something being apodeictic. An explanation is deictic to the degree that it is focused on explaining <em>a particular thing</em> and what is interesting about it specifically, while it is apodeictic to the degree that it is focused on explaining <em>a general phenomenon</em> and the conditions under which it emerges.</p>


<p>Maybe. I can't tell for sure, because he doesn't provide me with any concrete examples to test this. Certainly I would very much not have thought of philosophy or religion as at all examples of things prone to deictic explanations. Art I will grant, certainly, and politics certainly is full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked problems</a>, which by their nature require attention to the specifics of the unique thing involved.</p>


<p>All of this confusion would easily have been cleared up with some examples and a bit more spelling out of his meaning.</p>


<h3>An example of a good definition</h3>


<p>In contrast, I think the following definition from Bernard Suits's "The Grasshopper", is very good:</p>


<blockquote>
<p>To play a game is to attempt to achieve a specific state of affairs [prelusory goal], using only means permitted by rules [lusory means], where the rules prohibit use of more efficient in favour of less efficient means [constitutive rules], and where the rules are accepted just because they make possible such activity [lusory attitude]. I also offer the following simpler and, so to speak, more portable version of the above: playing a game is the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This has both the precise definition and the intuitive handle on it. It then goes on for several pages more to investigate how this does and doesn't apply to specific examples, which I won't include here. It doesn't have a mathematician's "<strong>Definition:</strong>" preamble, but that wouldn't really fit the style of the book, and it's still its own paragraph.</p>


<h3>Appropriate levels of precision</h3>


<p>In my gold standard for "good definition" I said "It provides as precise an explanation of what the term means as is reasonable".
The reason for the "as is reasonable" clause is that it is rarely the case that one can define something perfectly precisely,
at least outside of the realm of mathematics or constrained rule based environments (e.g. laws, rituals, games).</p>


<p>In reality many things cannot be this precisely defined, and we need more example-based (philosophers would say "ostensive") and sketch explanations. For example I can't really define "red" for you, but I can tell you that red is a colour (hopefully you don't need me to define "colour", because I'd really struggle with this one) and then point at examples of things that are red and things that are not red until you get the picture.</p>


<p>This is particularly common when you start talking about people, as people are reliably messy and complicated, and it becomes hard to precisely define a term rigorously. That's fine. We can still talk usefully about things like "love" without answering the question "What is love?", it just requires us to be a bit more careful about how we do it, and how we use examples. It may also require us to talk around a bit more about what we do and don't mean.</p>


<p>For an example of why one might need to do this, a question that came up in discussion recently is "What does 'unconditional' mean in 'unconditional love'?". It turned out everyone was using it differently (e.g. does it refer to how the love would change if circumstances change, or is it a character of the type of love felt in the moment?). This is the sort of confusion that comes up in the absence of a sufficiently precise definition. We cannot always solve it with that better definition, but we do need to navigate it.</p>


<p>This ties in to the question of teaching tacit knowledge that I talked about in <a href="https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/how-to-teach-the-local-style">How to teach the local style</a>. These definitions cannot perfectly capture the thing you want to convey, but you can get the rough idea, and you can correct any errors along the way.</p>


<p>One thing that I think is important is that when you've introduced something this way you need to hold people's hands more when you use the term. Every time it comes up in future is an opportunity to refine their understanding of it, and it's worth taking many of those opportunities.</p>


<h3>How bad definitions thrive</h3>


<p>Why do so few people meet my standards of good definitions?</p>


<p>I think, primarily, people write bad definitions for the following reasons:</p>


<ol>
<li>Nobody taught them how to write good definitions, because the practice is so rare outside of mathematicians (and also nobody teaches mathematicians to do it well, they just hope they pick it up by example like everything else important in mathematics).</li>
<li>Writing good definitions is much harder work than defining things badly.</li>
<li>Writing good definitions will often reveal that the emperor has no clothes and you're using big words for no goddamn good reason to make yourself sound clever.</li>
</ol>


<p>I'm hoping in this essay I have done at least some small part to offset the first, although it probably needs a longer essay with more worked examples and better explanations of the various moving parts to really work for that.</p>


<p>The second is, in fact, good. Writing definitions <em>should</em> be hard, because every time you introduce a new term (even when you introduce it well!) you are asking the reader to do a bunch of work, and significantly harming their ability to understand your text. Often the best way to define something is to figure out a way to not need it at all, and where you do need it it's worth putting in the work to make sure that people can actually use it.</p>


<p>The third is, I think, the most pernicious. I'm a big fan of Michael Billig's "Learn to write badly: How to succeed in the social sciences". I tried to find some good excerpts to include here, but it's not actually all that well suited to excerpting. In short, he argues that much of the use of jargon and technical terms in the social sciences is of an imprecise sort that <em>cannot</em> be defined precisely in this way, because that would lose its social function, which is more about marketing your ideas and protecting them from criticism than it is about carefully and helpfully communicating them.</p>


<p>Charitably, I don't think most people are deliberately leaning into this incentive, but I do think many people are innocently writing in a style that these incentives have shaped, and demanding clear communication is a good way to push back on those incentives.</p>

<p class="subtitle">A round-tripping problem with expected utility theory</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-06-07</dd>
</dl>


<p>For reasons, I've been thinking about subjective expected utility theory and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Morgenstern_utility_theorem">Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility theorem</a> ("the VNM theorem" for short) recently.
I have some significant philosophical objections to subjective expected utility and I'm going to explore a few of them in a series of notebook posts. This post is about an interesting thing I noticed while trying to articulate those objections.
I don't necessarily expect it to persuade anyone of anything.</p>


<p>The problem is this: The VNM theorem loses information. You cannot actually reconstruct the original decision procedure from the output of the VNM theorem, because the VNM theorem's output isn't quite what it's usually framed as.</p>


<p>The VNM theorem is as follows: Suppose you have a set of outcomes \(\mathcal{O} = \{O_1, \ldots, O_n\}\).
A lottery \(L\) is a random variable in \(\mathcal{O}\).</p>


<p>An agent has preferences over lotteries, expressed by a preorder \(\preceq\) and an indifference relation \(\sim\).
That is \(L \preceq L'\) means that \(L'\) is at least as good as \(L\), and \(L \sim L'\) means the agent is indifferent between them.</p>


<p>The VNM theorem is that under certain reasonableness conditions, this preorder must be expressible in terms of a utility function \(u: \mathcal{O} \to \mathbb{R}\), such that \(L \preceq L'\) if and only if \(E(u(L)) \leq E(u(L'))\). i.e. we prefer a lottery if it has a higher expected utility, and are indifferent between two lotteries with the same expected utility.</p>


<p>It's instructive to sketch the proof of this theorem:</p>


<p>Because we have a total order over outcomes, there is a best outcome and a worst outcome. Call them \(B\) and \(W\) respectively. If \(B \sim W\) then we're necessarily indifferent between all lotteries, so assume \(W \prec B\).
Now, consider the family of lotteries \(M_p\) such that \(M_p\) is \(B\) with probability \(p\) and \(W\) with probability \(1 - p\). So \(M_1 = B\) and \(M_0 = W\).</p>


<p>Let \(L\) be some lottery. We must have \(M_0 = W \preceq L \preceq B = M_1\).
Therefore (by the hypotheses of the theorem) we can find some \(p\) in the middle such that \(M_p \sim L\).
Some computation shows that this number \(p\) behaves like an expected value.</p>


<p>Thus the VNM theorem gives us the expected utility of an arbitrary lottery. Right?</p>


<p>Except, it doesn't. It guarantees that this expected utility exists, but it does not actually give us a way to compute it.
The hypothesis of the VNM theorem is that there is some point at which the switchover to indifference happens, but we are not given an oracle which computes that probability, only a guarantee of its existence.</p>


<p>Instead what we have to do is turn our oracle for preferences into a sort of mathematical root finding algorithm to find increasingly fine grained approximations to \(p\). We construct a sequence of approximations \(q_k \leq p \leq r_k\) by setting \(q_0 = 0\), \(r_0 = 1\), then to calculate \(q_{k+1}, r_{k+q}\) we set \(s_k = \frac{q_k + r_k}{2}\) and then asking whether \(M_{s_k} \preceq L\). If yes, we set \(q_{k + 1} = r_k, r_{k + 1} = s_k\), if no we set \(q_{k + 1} = s_k, r_{k + 1} = r_k\).</p>


<p>There is no guarantee that this process will ever terminate - the numbers for which it terminates are precisely the dyadic rationals, the integers divided by some power of two, so for example if \(p = \frac{1}{3}\) it will go on forever, producing increasingly good approximations. You can design other divide and conquer schemes - there's nothing special about this particular one - but they will all have this problem of there being some utility values that this doesn't converge to.</p>


<p>(Honesty compels me to admit that this problem goes away if you insist that probabilities and utilities have to be rational numbers, because you can design a divide and conquer scheme that just enumerates all of the rationals between the current bounds. For technical reasons that I will not go into here I find this a fundamentally unsatisfying conclusion, but the short version is that the real numbers are a better approximation to the problems of physical measurement than the rational numbers are)</p>


<p>Which is fine, in practical terms you will very rarely need to know your utility to the last decimal place, but the interesting thing to note is this: Given access to a procedure that provides these increasingly fine grained approximations to the expected utility, you cannot actually recreate the original decision procedure with a process that is guaranteed to terminate.</p>


<p>The problem is this: Suppose we have some procedure that calculates a relationship \(\preceq'\) based on such converging approximate utilities. We want \(\preceq'\) to be identical with \(\preceq\), so lets assume we've succeeded and see if this leads to a contradiction.</p>


<p>Let \(p\) be some number where the process doesn't terminate and ask whether \(M_p \preceq' M_p\) (using the same \(M_p\) as above). If \(\preceq'\) agrees with \(\preceq\) we will get the correct answer that \(M_p \sim' M_p\).</p>


<p>Now, look at how many steps of the approximation you had to compute in order to get to that point, say \(k\). This gives us an interval \(q_k \leq p \leq r_k\).</p>


<p>Now at this point we decided that \(M_p \sim' M_p\) based on no information other than that \(p \in [q_k, r_k]\). Therefore for any other \(s \in [q_k, r_k]\) we would also decide that \(M_p \sim M_s\) (because we can't tell based on what we've computed that \(p \neq s\)). But in our original relationship we must have \(M_p \prec M_s\) or \(M_s \prec M_p\), because their utilities are \(p\) and \(s\) respectively. Therefore we have failed to recreate \(\preceq\) from the output of the VNM theorem.</p>


<p>Why is this interesting?</p>


<p>Well, mostly it's interesting because this looks exactly like my normal objections to the VNM theorem, but normally I justify it on practical grounds: You run into <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredkin%27s_paradox">Fredkin's paradox</a> (a term I've only recently learned - I've always thought of this as the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass">Buridan's ass problem</a>), where the amount of work you have to do to decide goes to infinity as you approach points of indifference.
From a practical viewpoint where you have all sorts of measurement and approximation problems,
this is (to me) obviously a problem with the theory, which is generally handwaved away by the setup:
The VNM theorem basically starts by saying "OK so first assume you're omniscient..." which is what allows it to start by assuming that you have this decision procedure.</p>


<p>The interesting thing about this result is that the VNM theorem runs into this problem even on its own terms, without introducing any additional assumptions of physical reasonableness (unless you count "cannot run a literally infinite amount of computation"). The VNM theorem starts from an omniscient decision procedure and constructs a utility function, but you cannot run that process backwards from the utility function to such a decision procedure because of precisely the sorts of limitations that meant that you couldn't really have constructed that procedure in the first place. </p>
