<p class="subtitle">You have to do the easy bits first</p>


<dl class="metadata">

<p>I was helping a small child with a jigsaw puzzle the other day. We were assembling a map of Africa.</p>


<p>At some point she asked me "Why is this so easy for you and so hard for me?"</p>


<p>It was a good question.</p>


<p>The easy answer is just "I'm 31 years older than you, I’ve learned a few tricks".</p>


<p>I didn't say this, but I do think it's important. She's seven. There's no reason she should have figured out everything by now. She's still learning. That's what seven year olds do.</p>


<p>But really there was only one trick, and it’s well within the reach of a seven year old if they can learn how.</p>


<p>"Well, I’m doing the easy bits" I answered.</p>


<p>I explained a bit further, but I don’t think it quite landed.</p>


<p>So here is what I would say with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27esprit_de_l%27escalier">the wit of the staircase</a> upon me.</p>


<p>What you are doing is picking up a piece, and trying to figure out where to put it. Or you see a space that needs filling, and look for the piece that will fit it.</p>


<p>This is much too hard. Of course you're struggling, I would struggle too if I tried to solve the puzzle that way.</p>


<p>Here is what I do instead: I do the same thing, and if it's hard, I stop. Then I look elsewhere. I put the piece aside, I look at another space, hoping that that one will be easier.</p>


<p>There are many pieces, and many spaces, on the puzzle board, and some of them are hard, and some of them are easy. A blue square in the middle of the ocean is hard, a country boundary with distinctive colours is probably easy.</p>


<p>You can get good at spotting which ones are likely to be easy, but you mostly don't need to. You just try to place a piece, and if it works, it was one of the easy ones. If it doesn't, you try something else.</p>


<p>Eventually you'll get good at spotting the easy pieces first, but you don't have to. Just be persistent, try them all. It usually won't take long to find an easy piece.</p>


<p>And when you've placed an easy piece, something funny happens: Pieces that were once hard, suddenly become easy.</p>


<p>You fill a space, and now you have one less piece to place, and new spaces to place it.</p>


<p>Bit by bit, the picture takes shape, and as it does the problem becomes easier, because you have more to work with.</p>


<p>If you've only got a few pieces, you can just try them all, and one of them will work. When you're down to a handful, there are no hard pieces left.</p>


<p>We can solve the hardest puzzles this way. All we need is a bit of persistence and some good tactics.</p>


<p>This isn't just about puzzles. You do the same with sudoku.</p>


<p>When we play sudoku together, you get stuck on a square. You look at it, trying to figure out what numbers go there.</p>


<p>Often you get frustrated. "I can't figure out what should go there".</p>


<p>Well of course you can't. You've picked one of the hard squares. Pick an easy square.</p>


<p>This is what's happening when I point to another square and say "Do you know what goes in this square?" - I look at the board until I find the easy square, and then I show it to you, and you find it easy, because you're perfectly able to solve the sudoku if you look in the right place.</p>


<p>And once you've solved the easy square, now you know more about the other squares. A three went there, so there can't be a three in these squares, which means that one must be a two, which means that that one must be a four...</p>


<p>As soon as you've done the easy bit, everything around it becomes easier. This is the way we solve the puzzle.</p>


<p>This is also the way we fix the world.</p>


<p>This is a story about a seven year old, but it's not really a story about a seven year old, because people far older than me seem to miss this too.</p>


<p>People often ask me how I know so many different subjects, or write about so many different things, when they struggle to do a tenth that.</p>


<p>Well, I'm doing the easy bits.</p>


<p>If I run into a problem I can't solve yet, or I encounter a subject that's too hard for me, I go "Huh, interesting", and save it for later, or leave it to someone better suited to it.</p>


<p>I don't <em>give up</em>. This is important. I just move on to something else, often something nearby.</p>


<p>I find a problem I can solve, and then I solve it.</p>


<p>And everything else becomes easier.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The edge of the familiar</p>


<dl class="metadata">

</dl>


<p>I'm reading "Why Poetry?" by Zapruder.</p>


<p>Why why poetry? Well, why not?</p>


<p>"I don’t know what writers of stories and novels and essays eventually discover for themselves, but I can say that sooner or later poets figure out there are no new ideas, only the same old ones", he says.</p>


<p>He is wrong. This is a poet's problem. The ideas are there, but you cannot do poetry to them.</p>


<p>We are awash in new ideas, if we let ourselves listen for them. Generally we do not.</p>


<p>Zapruder later cites Shklovsky, "Art as technique".</p>


<p>Shklovsky talks about "defamiliarization", or as Zapruder prefers, "strangeifying". The role of art is to trace the contours of the familiar, drawing your attention to it in ways that make it strange.</p>


<p>Well, if that's what you're doing, how could you have new ideas?</p>


<p>How can you strangeify that which is already strange to you?</p>


<p>I think, perhaps, the role of art can never be to create the new.
It shows us what is already there, in a new light, allowing us to imagine that it could be different.</p>


<p>It draws you to the very edge of the familiar,
and then tells you: Here we are. This is as far as I can take you. The rest is up to you.</p>

<p class="subtitle">You can solve your problems, but you don't have to</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-25</dd>
</dl>


<p>Before I start, let me tell you some important truths:</p>


<ol>
<li>Just because you can solve a problem, does not mean you are obliged to solve it.</li>
<li>Just because you choose not to solve a problem, doesn't mean you don't care about it.</li>
<li>Just because you don't care about a problem you think is important, doesn't make you a bad person.</li>
<li>Just because other people think a problem is important, doesn't mean you have to.</li>
</ol>


<p>You are a small and finite human being, and you only have so much capacity to deal with the world,
and the world can absorb all of that capacity before you engage with the tiniest fraction of its problems.
There are more than seven billion people out there, every one of them has problems,
and even trying to solve all of <em>your</em> problems is probably going to overwhelm you.
Among the billions upon billions of important problems you could devote your efforts to, you've probably got the capacity for at most a few dozen at any given time, and you're probably doing less than that because running permanently at full capacity will make you miserable (and eventually reduce your capacity anyway).</p>


<p>I hope you know these things intellectually, but I bet you don't believe all of them emotionally,
and my evidence is this: There are a lot of problems that I could tell you how to solve that would cause you to immediately get mad at me for suggesting that you can solve them.</p>


<p>I don't know what they are, they very from person to person, but most people are walking around with easily solvable problems that they are steadfastly maintaining that they can't solve, because if they could solve them they would still not want to, and then they would feel guilty about that.</p>


<p>People are very good at maintaining a set of beliefs that allow them to not feel guilty,
and the easiest way to do this is to believe that anything you think you should do but don't want to is impossible.
If you argue this belief convincingly enough, often other people will believe you and stop trying to get you to solve the problem you don't want to do.</p>


<p>It's a genuinely good strategy, as long as you don't mind (or mind less than the alternatives) walking around in constant fear that you might one day discover the truth.</p>


<p>One way this comes out is that every time I offer generic advice on Twitter, I get people mad at me for suggesting that they could solve the problem I'm advising on.
They're very insistent that it's literally impossible this advice will work. Usually their reason is one that the advice was specifically designed with in mind. e.g. I hear a lot of my advice is terrible because it doesn't work for ADHD. This is particularly funny because it's often developed by listening to or talking with people with ADHD, and developed further to work with my own more ADHD tendencies given that I'm only just below the diagnostic thresholds myself.</p>


<p>Not every problem in your life is solvable, some really are immutable features of reality, but I am almost certain that vastly more of them are than you're pretending. I fully endorse your right and respect your choice not to solve them. I even fully endorse your right to not listen to me when I tell you that they're solvable. But I do not endorse your right to give me a hard time for talking about solutions, because many people are helped by trying to solve the problems they want to solve, and I have no desire to be complicit in maintaining a shared lie that hurts those people.</p>


<p>Options exist. If you want to choose to believe otherwise, that's on you, but don't make your self-protective strategies an excuse to sabotage others.</p>

<p class="subtitle">First decide what's good enough</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-23</dd>
</dl>


<p>One of my common pieces of advice is that when doing something or making something, you should separate your planning into two distinct goals:</p>


<ol>
<li>How good do you need the thing to be?</li>
<li>How good would you like the thing to be?</li>
</ol>


<p>Your first priority is to come up with a plan that all but guarantees that the thing you make will be as good as you need it to be. For example, when giving a talk, you don't <em>need</em> a lot. If your talk is coherent, vaguely interesting, and doesn't run over time, you've succeeded. You've given a talk that is good enough, well done.</p>


<p>Once you've ensured that, you can stop feeling anxious about it, because you've removed any uncertainty about whether you will succeed. You will succeed, it's just up for you to tinker with the details. You can make it better for as long as it's worth making it better, and when it's not worth it any more you can just stop there and declare your planning done.</p>


<p>Generally I find you actually produce better results by doing it this way, because removing the anxiety reliably improves performance.</p>


<p>You don't have to though. One nice thing about this approach is that you get very good at making sure something is good enough without having to put much effort on it. Then, when you have times where you really don't feel like putting in a lot of effort, you can massively phone it in, and that's fine too.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Learning from the real</p>


<dl class="metadata">
<dt>Published</dt>
<dd class="post-date">2021-07-22</dd>
</dl>


<p>Back in <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-03-04-11:18.html">Skirting the edge of disaster</a> I pointed out that most complex systems that have been running in production for a while (e.g. a legacy software system, the London underground, humanity) have the form that they do as a result of the following two rules:</p>


<ol>
<li>If an important system is broken, we fix it.</li>
<li>If a system has spare capacity, we place more demands on it.</li>
</ol>


<p>As you can tell from the title of the linked piece, I was mostly framing this as a bad thing: The consequence of being at a stable balance of these two things is that the system is constantly almost but not-quite broken, because every time it gets too far from broken it gets loaded more, and every time it breaks it gets fixed.</p>


<p>But there's another side to this that I think is interesting: If you encounter a reasonably stable complex system in the wild (and you do, very regularly), this reliably means:</p>


<ol>
<li>It does a lot of things, because capabilities kept accreting over time, and they're often not things you would have thought of without that infrastructure because it changes what's easy and cheap to do.</li>
<li>Everything that would have stopped it from doing those things has been solved.</li>
</ol>


<p>A lot of time, work, and ingenuity has often gone into getting it to that state, much of which would have been impossible to figure out from first principles because you had to <a href="https://notebook.drmaciver.com/posts/2020-02-26-16:07.html">try things and see what happened</a> before you could even learn that you needed to solve the problems, let alone how.</p>


<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)">Gall's law</a> is "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system."</p>


<p>But this then leads to the question: OK smart guy, how do I make a working simple system?</p>


<p>And I think the answer is often this: Go find a complex system that does what you want, and study it until you understand it well enough to extract a simple system from it.</p>
