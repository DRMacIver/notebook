## What is a topic string?

In fact, the most egregious example I have of this isn't from a philosophy text:

> To most readers the original has no consistent focus, no consistent string of topics that focuses attention on a circumscribed set of concepts. So, as most readers feel dislocated, disoriented, or unfocused, they describe the passage as disjointed, choppy, lacking in "flow." The revised version consistently focuses on fewer concepts: for the most part, some variation on topics and reader. It has a more consistent topic string, and therefore feels more focused, more cohesive.

This is from Williams and Colomb's "Style: Towards Clarity and Grace", talking about how to use the concept of a topic string to understand why some technical prose is clear and flows well and some is not.

There's just one critical problem with this paragraph: Reading this I  have no way to know what they mean by a "topic string", because this is the point at which they introduce the term and if they think that this is a clear way to define a new term they are woefully, inexcusably, mistaken. They have neither defined it nor given examples, and as a result I am left confused both as to the meaning of this paragraph and the no doubt very helpful term they have failed to usefully introduce.

[This page on transitions by David McMurrey](https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/transitions.html) is a little better, but mostly because of the examples, the initial introduction is decent but a little weak:

> Coherence can be achieved within paragraphs and between sections simply by rearranging keywords within sentences. For example, a new topic introduced in the second half of one sentence can begin the following sentence. These are called topic strings.

What does "these" refer to? In particular what is the "string" in the topic string? Is the fact that you are specifically introducing the new topic in the second half of one sentence and beginning it in the next the topic string? I don't think so, based on subsequent text and examples.

Later he says this:

> Coherence can achieved by simply rearranging the occurence of keywords in paragraphs or sections. Look for a keyword that conspicuously occurs multiple times. Think of the occurrences of those keywords as a topic string. 

This is subtly different from what he said above, although I think compatible.

If I were to attempt a definition of "topic string" based on this I would say something like:


# Terminology is hermeneutical infrastructure

Don't let the title panic you, I'm about to tell you what it means, in detail.

## Terminology as infrastructure

I'm a big fan (with some qualifications and caveats) of Bowker and Star's "Sorting Things Out: Classification and its Consequences", which talks about classification systems and the functions they serve and the social processes that leads to them. One of its key ideas is classification systems as *infrastructure*, drawing on a previous definition of infrastructure from Star and Ruhleder's earlier "Steps toward an Ecology of Infrastructure: Design and Access for Large Information Spaces" (which I have not read, though probably should).

Their "definition" of infrastructure starts from highlighting that infrastructure is a relational concept. That is, things are not either infrastructure or not, but instead things are *used as* infrastructure. The following properties indicate something is serving the function of infrastructure:

> * Embeddedness. Infrastructure is "sunk" into, inside of, other structures, social arrangements and technologies;
> * Transparency. Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense that it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each task, but invisibly supports those tasks;
> * Reach or scope. This may be either spatial or temporal - infrastructure has reach beyond a single event or one-site practice;
> * Learned as part of membership. The taken-for-grantedness of artifacts and organizational arrangements is a sine qua non of membership in a community of practice. Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned about. New participants acquire a naturalized familiarity with its objects as they become members;
> * Links with conventions of practice. Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice, e.g. the ways that cycles of daynight work are affected by and affect electrical power rates and needs. Generations of typists have learned the QWERTY keyboard; its limitations are inherited by the computer keyboard and thence by the design of today’s
computer furniture (Becker, 1982);
> * Embodiment of standards. Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardized fashion.
> * Built on an installed base. Infrastructure does not grow de novo; it wrestles with the “inertia of the installed base” and inherits strengths and limitations from that base. Optical fibers run along old railroad lines; new systems are designed for backward-compatibility; and failing to account for these constraints may be fatal or distorting to new development processes
(Monteiro, et al., 1994).
> * Becomes visible upon breakdown. The normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout. Even when there are back-up mechanisms or procedures, their existence further highlights the now-visible infrastructure.

I get what they are pointing at, but my standards this is a *terrible* definition, to the point of barely counting as one (to some degree this is my mathematician-centric bias as to what definitions do and are for, but as previously mentioned my standards are right and everyone else's are wrong).
I think it can be rescued by instead framing "infrastructure" as a black box term, with these intended to be a sort of intuitive handle. It's not that these are defining features of infrastructure, so much as that when we talk about something as infrastructure these are among the characteristics of it that we are highlighting.

# You are not harmless

I should warn you in advance that this article may make you feel bad.
I have deliberately chosen to do this, and I take full responsibility for that.

I've been thinking about consequences and people's relationship with guilt a lot recently.

One of the interesting consequences of the pandemic is that, if you're paying attention, it is an excellent course in risk management.

A supplementary interesting consequence of the pandemic is that it makes very very clear that most people have no interest in paying attention, and will respond to any attempt to get them to reason about risk in a competent ethical way as a personal attack.

This is, in some sense, rational behaviour on their part, because as long as they refuse to consider the consequences of their actions, any consequences can be treated as "not their fault". If you give someone COVID knowingly, this is treated as ethically much worse than if you do so unknowingly, so in order to protect yourself from feelings of guilt the rational strategy is to avoid ever learning about risk management.

You can also deny the risk exists at all of course and maintain that everyone who tells you to the contrary is lying. This is an even better strategy, although runs the risk of being proven wrong when you get COVID.
Better to claim ignorance and just pretend the risks are unknown and unknowable.

The depressing thing about all of this is how little of it is specific to COVID. This is just how people work. Ignorance is a solid strategy for minimising guilt.

But you are not harmless. Every action you perform has some chance of causing harm. Some of them have a large chance. That harm is your responsibility, in that you are responsible for it and should be taking it into account in your actions.

To some degree, that harm is your responsibility *even when it is not your fault*. If I get into a car accident entirely because of someone else's bad driving, it is still the case that I chose to be driving a car on the road, in full knowledge that this increased the chances of being in a car accident. The specific accident that occurred was not my fault, but the world in which that accident was more likely to occur is partly my doing.

This is something I've written about before in [Ethical decisions and life patterns](https://drmaciver.substack.com/p/ethical-decision-making-and-life) (this is a paid link), but I'd like to focus on a different angle of it today.


# Ouch

I have what is, depending on how you look at it, either a very sophisticated and mature approach to personal development or something of a masochistic streak.
When I encounter a new therapeutic technique or thing that might help that would clearly be painfully revealing, I tend to go "That sounds awful, lets do it".

(This is not to say that I'm good at *keeping* doing it, mind)

The result

# Can one aspire?

Last year I read Agnes Callard's "Aspiration", a book about the process of rationally choosing to acquire new values.

At the time I was somewhat dismissive of the bits of it that were the obligatory part of any analytic philosophy book where you argue with other analytic philosophers, real or imagined, because I thought much of what she was saying was obviously true. I may have to revisit my feelings on the subject, and I will definitely have to revisit the book to properly engage with it (I'm away from my library and don't particularly want to do this with the ebook form), because I find myself possibly joining the crowds of people who disagree with it.

In particular the question I find myself wondering about is whether one can really aspire in this sense.
Not so much because I don't think people can change their values through rational action,
but more because I think they can't not, and I have questions about the approach to it that she describes.
